# Examples

The examples in this folder provide a high-level examples of the YAML schemas and their JSON equivalents:

- [Class](./class.yaml) based on the [classes schema](../classes.json).
- [Data type](./datatype.yaml) based on the [datatypes schema](../datatypes.json).
- [Enum](./class.yaml) based on the [enums schema](../enums.json).
- [Global](./global.yaml) based on the [globals schema](../globals.json).
- [Library](./library.yaml) based on the [libraries schema](../libraries.json).
- [Navigation](./navigation.yaml) based on the navigation schema.

The JSON schemas remain the source of truth for the YAML schema because some fields are optional or are enumerated lists, neither of which are fully demonstrated in the YAML examples.
