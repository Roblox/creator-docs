import ControllerEmulator from '../includes/studio/controller-emulator.md'

Roblox accepts input from gamepads such as Xbox and PlayStation controllers. To simplify cross‑platform inputs, including gamepads, Roblox provides the [Input Action System](../input/input-action-system.md) to define **actions** such as "jump," "sprint," or "shoot" and set up **bindings** for multiple hardware inputs to drive those actions.

When binding gamepad inputs, see [common control schemas](#common-control-schemas) to create a consistent gamepad experience for players. After inputs are set, you can enhance the player's experience by including [haptic feedback](#haptic-feedback) on supported controllers.

As you build out support for gamepads, remember to test frequently using a connected gamepad or the [Controller&nbsp;Emulator](#controller-emulation) in Studio.

## Input type detection

In cross‑platform development, it's important that you determine and respond to the `Class.UserInputService.PreferredInput|PreferredInput` type a player is using, normally to ensure that [UI&nbsp;elements](../ui/index.md#ui-objects) like on-screen buttons and menus work elegantly and support interaction across devices.

For example, a console assumes that gamepads are the default input, but a player on PC or laptop may also choose to connect a bluetooth gamepad. In this case, mouse/keyboard remains a valid input for that player, but you can assume they want to switch to the connected gamepad as the **primary** input type.

See [input type detection](./index.md#input-type-detection) for more information.

<Alert severity="info">
For alternative gamepad detection methods, see the `Class.UserInputService.GamepadEnabled` property and the `Class.UserInputService.GamepadConnected|GamepadConnected`/`Class.UserInputService.GamepadDisconnected|GamepadDisconnected` events.

## Common control schemas

When considering specific control bindings for the [Input Action System](../input/input-action-system.md), it's best to establish consistency across different games and experiences. The following input bindings will help players immediately feel familiar and comfortable with gamepad controls.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Common use cases</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|ButtonA`</td>
    <td>Accepts player prompts or GUI selections. Alternatively used for primary actions such as jumping.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|ButtonB`</td>
    <td>Cancels player prompts or GUI selections. Alternatively used for secondary actions such as a dodge, roll, or sprint.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|Thumbstick1`</td>
    <td>Generally associated with character movement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|Thumbstick2`</td>
    <td>Generally associated with camera movement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|ButtonL2`, `Enum.KeyCode|ButtonR2`</td>
    <td>Generally used for primary actions, such as shooting. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Enum.KeyCode|ButtonL1`, `Enum.KeyCode|ButtonR1`, `Enum.KeyCode|ButtonX`, `Enum.KeyCode|ButtonY`</td>
    <td>Secondary actions such as reloading, targeting, or accessing an inventory or minimap.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Haptic feedback

Many gamepad controllers have motors built in to provide haptic feedback. Adding rumbles and vibrations can greatly enhance a player's experience and provide subtle feedback beyond visuals or audio.

Roblox supports haptics for PlayStation gamepads, Xbox gamepads, and the Quest Touch controller. Haptic feedback is managed through `Class.HapticEffect` instances which can be set to a specific `Class.HapticEffect.Type|Type` such as `Enum.HapticEffectType|GameplayCollision` or `Enum.HapticEffectType|UIClick`.

Once a `Class.HapticEffect` is in place, you can initiate it through the `Class.HapticEffect:Play()|Play()` method, for instance:

```lua
local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

local effect = Instance.new("HapticEffect")
effect.Type = Enum.HapticEffectType.GameplayExplosion
effect.Parent = Workspace

-- Play the haptic effect
effect:Play()
```
