description: Explains Roblox support for mobile devices.
---

Over half of all Roblox sessions are played on mobile devices so it is important to consider cross-platform accessibility when designing your experience for a wide audience. You should aim to create an ideal cross-platform experience that supports a variety of input devices, including [mouse and keyboard inputs](./mouse-and-keyboard.md) and [gamepad](./gamepad.md).

When designing a mobile experience, consider the [device orientation](#device-orientation) that you intend user's to use in your experience, then implement your inputs with `Class.ContextActionService` to perform the following mobile-related input tasks:

- [Create on-screen buttons](#adding-mobile-buttons) visible only on mobile devices.
- [Customize the mobile buttons and UI](#customizing-button-ui) to create a unique mobile experience.
- [Setup context dependent inputs](#context-dependent-inputs) that allows the same button or input to perform a different action depending on the situation.
- [Detect other input devices](#detecting-other-devices), such as a mouse or keyboard connected to a mobile tablet, to provide the correct on-screen prompts to the user.

## Device Orientation

On phones and tablets, the device orientation majorly affects the user experience and interaction. For example, landscape mode is best operated with two thumbs while portrait mode may lend itself to one-finger interface.

By default, Roblox experiences run in landscape mode, allowing the experience to switch between landscape "left" and landscape "right" as the user's device rotates. However, experiences can be locked to a particular orientation if desired.

### Orientation Modes

There are five different orientation modes, including two sensor-based modes and three locked modes.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Sensor Modes</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Landscape Sensor</td>
    <td>The default Roblox setting in which the experience always appears in landscape mode (no portrait mode) and the device detects its physical orientation to ensure the experience view is always oriented upward.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sensor</td>
    <td>The device detects its physical orientation to ensure the experience view is always oriented upward, switching between landscape and portrait mode as needed.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Locked Modes</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Landscape Left</td>
    <td>On devices with a physical home button, the home button is to the left of the display. On devices with a virtual home/nav bar, its touch region is at the bottom of the display.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landscape Right</td>
    <td>On devices with a physical home button, the home button is to the right of the display. On devices with a virtual home/nav bar, its touch region is at the bottom of the display.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Portrait</td>
    <td>On devices with a physical home button, the home button is below the display. On devices with a virtual home/nav bar, its touch region is at the bottom of the display.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Alert severity="warning">
Roblox does not include a "portrait upside-down" mode since many devices do not natively support that orientation.
</Alert>

### Orientation Properties

When setting an orientation, you can set the [Starting Orientation](#starting-orientation), the [In-Experience Orientation](#in-experience-orientation), and the [Current Orientation](#current-orientation).

#### Starting Orientation

`Class.StarterGui.ScreenOrientation` sets the default orientation for a place. Acceptable values include:

- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.LandscapeSensor`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.Sensor`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.LandscapeRight`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.Portrait`

Because this property affects all new users who join the experience, you can set its value in `Class.StarterGui` â†’ `Enum.ScreenOrientation` within Studio.

#### In-Experience Orientation

`Class.PlayerGui.ScreenOrientation` explicitly changes the experience's orientation for a user. When this property is set to one of the `Enum.ScreenOrientation` enums in a `Class.LocalScript`, the experience will immediately orient itself to match the setting. This can be useful when an experience needs to provide a particular experience like locking the view to portrait for a minigame.

The following code sample in a `Class.LocalScript` sets the screen orientation to portrait:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local playerGUI = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")

task.wait(2)

playerGUI.ScreenOrientation = Enum.ScreenOrientation.Portrait
```

#### Current Orientation

`Class.PlayerGui.CurrentScreenOrientation` gets the current device orientation. Possible values include:

- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.LandscapeLeft`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.LandscapeRight`
- `Enum.ScreenOrientation|ScreenOrientation.Portrait`

The following code prints the user's current screen orientation:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local playerGUI = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")

print(playerGUI.CurrentScreenOrientation)
```

## Movement Modes

Roblox offers several `Class.StarterPlayer` properties you can set to change how users on mobile devices can move through your experience.

You can set mobile movement control schemes for Roblox experiences by changing the values of `Class.StarterPlayer.DevTouchMovementMode` to one of the following:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>`ClickToMove`</td>
    <td>Users can only move through the experience by tapping a target location. This mode includes a jump button in the lower-right region of the screen. [Automatic jumping](#automatic-jumping) is always active in this movement mode.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`DPad`</td>
    <td><Alert severity="error">This option has been removed from the Roblox mobile app and should not be used for production-ready experiences. </Alert></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`DynamicThumbstick`</td>
    <td>A dynamic thumbstick appears where the user initially presses down. This mode includes a jump button in the lower-right region of the screen. This is the default user setting for mobile users if `UserChoice` is set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Scriptable`</td>
    <td>Disables all default controls and allows you to [script your own control scheme](#adding-mobile-buttons).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Thumbpad`</td>
    <td><Alert severity="error">This option has been removed from the Roblox mobile app and should not be used for production-ready experiences. </Alert></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Thumbstick`</td>
    <td>A mobile thumbstick located in the lower-left region of the screen. Unlike `DynamicThumbstick`, the thumbstick position is static and doesn't change position when the user touches on the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`UserChoice`</td>
    <td>Allows users to choose their desired control scheme from the in-experience Settings menu. This is the default movement mode for experiences.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Automatic Jumping

When `StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled` is enabled, the user's character automatically jumps across gaps when approaching the edge of a platform. `StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled` is enabled by default for mobile devices.

Disable `StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled` to disable this feature and force users to jump only using their key bindings.

## Adding Mobile Buttons

To add mobile buttons, use the `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` method.

The `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction()` method takes the following parameters:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>actionName</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>An identifier string for the action you are binding. You can use the actionName with other functions in `Class.ContextActionService` to edit the binding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>functionToBind</td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>The function to call when the specified input is triggered. This function receives three arguments:
    <ul><li> A string equal to the actionName.</li>
    <li> A `Enum.UserInputState` which defines the input state when it called the function.</li>
    <li> The `Class.InputObject` used in the function call.</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>createTouchButton</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>When true, creates an on-screen button when the game is running on a mobile device.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>inputTypes</td>
    <td>tuple</td>
    <td>The inputs you intend to bind to the function, such as enum values from a `Enum.KeyCode`.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can use the following code sample to create an Interact action that creates an on-screen button and also accepts a [keyboard](./mouse-and-keyboard.md#keyboard-input) and [gamepad](./gamepad.md) input:

```lua
local ContextActionService = game:GetService("ContextActionService")

local function handleAction(actionName, inputState, inputObject)
	if inputState == Enum.UserInputState.Begin then
		print(actionName, inputObject)
	end
end

-- Bind action to function
ContextActionService:BindAction("Interact", handleAction, true, Enum.KeyCode.T, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonR1)
```

### Removing Mobile Buttons

To remove a mobile button from the screen, call `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction()` using the actionName string you passed to `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction()`.

Use the following code sample to unbind the previously created Interact action:

```lua
-- Unbind action by name
ContextActionService:UnbindAction("Interact")
```

## Customizing Button UI

You can use one of the several functions from `Class.ContextActionService` to customize the on-screen buttons that are created by `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction()`.

### Button Text

To change the text label for a mobile button, call `Class.ContextActionService:SetTitle()|SetTitle()` with the actionName string and a title:

```lua
-- Set button label to "Talk"
ContextActionService:SetTitle("Interact", "Talk")
```

### Button Image

Mobile buttons can use custom images just like other GUI buttons using the `Class.ContextActionService:SetImage()|SetImage()` method.

Use the following sample code to set a button image, replacing the asset ID with an image of your choice:

```lua
-- Set button image
ContextActionService:SetImage("Interact", "rbxassetid://0123456789")
```

### Button Position

By default, a new button's position appears near the lower right section of the screen. You should carefully consider button placement on mobile devices and keep in mind the positions of thumbs and hands.

Use the following sample code to set a button's position with the `Class.ContextActionService:SetPosition()|SetPosition()` method:

```lua
-- Set button position
ContextActionService:SetPosition("Interact", UDim2.new(1, -70, 0, 10))
```

## Context Dependent Inputs

When developing for mobile devices you may often want to change what a single button does based on the context. Since screen space on mobile devices limited, use contextual buttons that perform different actions based on what the character is able to do.

For example, you can display an active "Collect" button when the user is standing near a chest of gold:

<img
  src="../assets/scripting/input/Cross-Platform-Input-Detection-Mobile.png"
  width="80%" />

Use the following code sample to create a mobile button that is labelled "Collect" and is bound to the function collectTreasure():

```lua
local ContextActionService = game:GetService("ContextActionService")

local function collectTreasure(actionName, inputState, inputObject)
	if inputState == Enum.UserInputState.Begin then
		print("Collect treasure")
	end
end

ContextActionService:BindAction("Interact", collectTreasure, true, Enum.KeyCode.T, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonR1)
ContextActionService:SetPosition("Interact", UDim2.new(1, -70, 0, 10))
-- Set image to blue "Collect" button
ContextActionService:SetImage("Interact", "rbxassetid://0123456789")
```

At another point in the game, you can change the button to "Talk" when the user is standing near an NPC. Instead of adding and removing the existing button, you can simply use `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` on the existing Interact action, changing the function and button image.

Use the following code sample to set the existing button label to "Talk" and bind it to a function named talkToNPC():

```lua
ContextActionService:BindAction("Interact", talkToNPC, true, Enum.KeyCode.T, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonR1)
-- Set image to yellow "Talk" button
ContextActionService:SetImage("Interact", "rbxassetid://0011223344")

```

## Detecting Other Devices

In cross-platform experiences, it is necessary to know the user's current device in order to adjust the UI and display correct key binding prompts.

For example, if a user approaches a treasure chest and there's an action bound to collecting the gold, you can show mobile users an on-screen "Collect" button and desktop users an on-screen "T" key icon.

Keep in mind that a mobile device can also have a [mouse and keyboard](./mouse-and-keyboard.md) or [gamepad](./gamepad.md) plugged in. It is also possible that a desktop has a `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|touchscreen` enabled. It is important to reference the user's preferred input options by displaying input options for the actively used device.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/scripting/input/Cross-Platform-Input-Detection-PC.png" />
    <figcaption>PC</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/scripting/input/Cross-Platform-Input-Detection-Mobile.png" />
    <figcaption>Mobile</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

In these cases, you can use `Class.UserInputService` to detect which input devices are enabled. If multiple input devices are enabled, use `Class.UserInputService:GetLastInputType()` to get the user's last used input device to display on the UI.

You can use the following `Class.ModuleScript`, placed within `Class.ReplicatedStorage` and renamed to **UserInputModule**, to fetch the user's input type, after which you can adapt the UI layout or context to your experience's specific needs.

Use the following `Class.ModuleScript` to check for enabled input devices and the last used input device:

```lua
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

local UserInput = {}

local inputTypeString
-- If device has active keyboard and mouse, assume those inputs
if UserInputService.KeyboardEnabled and UserInputService.MouseEnabled then
	inputTypeString = "Keyboard/Mouse"
-- Else if device has touch capability but no keyboard and mouse, assume touch input
elseif UserInputService.TouchEnabled then
	inputTypeString = "Touch"
-- Else if device has an active gamepad, assume gamepad input
elseif UserInputService.GamepadEnabled then
	inputTypeString = "Gamepad"
end

function UserInput.getInputType()
	local lastInputEnum = UserInputService:GetLastInputType()

	if lastInputEnum == Enum.UserInputType.Keyboard or string.find(tostring(lastInputEnum.Name), "MouseButton") or lastInputEnum == Enum.UserInputType.MouseWheel then
		inputTypeString = "Keyboard/Mouse"
	elseif lastInputEnum == Enum.UserInputType.Touch then
		inputTypeString = "Touch"
	elseif string.find(tostring(lastInputEnum.Name), "Gamepad") then
		inputTypeString = "Gamepad"
	end
	return inputTypeString, lastInputEnum
end

return UserInput
```

Once the **UserInputModule** script is in place, use the following code sample in a `Class.LocalScript` to get the user's last input type:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

-- Require module
local UserInputModule = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("UserInputModule"))

local currentUserInput, inputEnum = UserInputModule.getInputType()
print(currentUserInput, inputEnum)
```
