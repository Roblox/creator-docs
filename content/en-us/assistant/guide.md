The Documentation Assistant is an AI assistant to help you build, grow, and monetize your creations by utilizing Roblox documentation. The Assistant is trained on the official Roblox documentation and designed to answer three categories of questions:

- **Build**: Answers questions about creating an experience in Roblox Studio. To learn more about building an experience on Roblox, see [Creation Overview](/creation).
- **Grow**: Answers questions about improving an existing experience by leveraging its analytics. To learn more about leveraging your experience's analytics, see [Analytics](../production/analytics/).
- **Monetize**: Answers questions about how to monetize your experience. To learn more about monetization on Roblox, see [Monetization](../production/monetization/).

## Prompting Tips

The more context and examples you can provide in your prompt the better. Instead of asking, "How can I design a core loop?" provide specific contextual examples, such as:

> Help me design a fun core loop for my game. Here are some relevant details:
>
> 1. I want to build a game where players can hunt treasure as pirates.
> 2. They can also buy and upgrade pirate ships and battle each other.

Doing so enables the Assistant to provide a more detailed and helpful response:

### Use Multi-Step Prompts

Consider using a multi-step prompt to encourage the Assistant to think. Instead of asking, "Can you explain this script to me?" and pasting the script, instead, ask it to explain it to you "step by step." Separate the instruction from the script with `###`.

> Can you explain what this script is doing step by step?
>
> `###`
>
> _Script_
>
> `###`

Doing so enables the Assistant to deconstruct and organize the information clearly to provide better answers:
