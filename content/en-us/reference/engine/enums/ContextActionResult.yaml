name: ContextActionResult
type: enum
summary: |
  Describes whether a contextual action should sink or pass input events.
description: |
  `ContextActionResult` controls the behavior of multiple bound actions. It
  gives the option of controlling whether or not a bound action should sink or
  pass the input event, meaning other things (including other bound actions) can
  process it.

  - name: Sink
    summary: |
      If `functionToBind` from `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` returns
      `Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink`, the input event will stop at that
      function and no other bound actions under it will be processed. This is
      the default behavior if `functionToBind` does not return anything or
      yields in any way.

  - name: Pass
    summary: |
      If `functionToBind` from `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` returns
      `Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass`, the input event is considered to have not
      been handled by `functionToBind` and will continue being passed to actions
      bound to the same input type.
