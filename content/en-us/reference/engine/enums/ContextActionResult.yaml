summary: |
  Describes whether a ContextAction should sink or pass input events.
description: |
  ContextActionResult controls the behavior of multiple bound actions. It gives
  the option of controlling whether or not a bound action should sink or pass
  the input event, meaning other things (including other bound actions) can
  process it.

    summary: |
      If _functionToBind_ from `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` returns
      Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink, the input event will stop at that function
      and no other bound actions under it will be . This is the default behavior
      if _functionToBind_ does not return anything or yields in any way.

  - name: Pass
    summary: |
      If _functionToBind_ from `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` returns
      Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass, the input event is considered to have not
      been handled by _functionToBind_ and will continue being passed to actions
      bound to the same input type.
