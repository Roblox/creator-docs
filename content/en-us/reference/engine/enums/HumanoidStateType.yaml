name: HumanoidStateType
type: enum
summary: |
  Describes the physics control states within the Humanoid.
description: |
  Identifies, reads and sets the physics control state of a `Class.Humanoid`.
  `Class.Humanoid:GetState()` and `Class.Humanoid:ChangeState()` methods, as
  well as the `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged` event currently use this Enum.

  Some states only allow manual setting, and allow a developer to make the
  Humanoid relinquish control of its character.

  When altering the Humanoid of a player, this should be done from a
  `Class.LocalScript` ran by that player on their local client. Certain states
  only work when set by the owner process (client or server). (Dead for example)
