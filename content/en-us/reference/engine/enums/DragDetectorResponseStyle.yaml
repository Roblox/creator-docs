    summary: |
      For an `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` object both inside the running
      experience and in Studio edit mode, the position/orientation of the object
      will be updated to exactly reflect the proposed motion. For an unanchored
      object, behavior is the same as for an anchored object; however, in a
      running experience, the object will be anchored at the start of the drag
      and restored to unanchored upon drag release.

    summary: |
      An `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` object will default to **Geometric**
      behavior as it is not affected by forces. An unanchored object will be
      moved by constraint forces that attempt to bring it to the desired
      position and/or orientation given by the proposed motion.

    summary: |
      The object will not move at all, but
      `Class.DragDetector.DragFrame|DragFrame` will still be updated and you can
      respond to drag manipulation however you'd like.
