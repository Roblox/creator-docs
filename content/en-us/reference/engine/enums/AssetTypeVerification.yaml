  Determines the asset type verification mode.
description: |
  Determines the asset type verification mode used when calling
  `Class.Humanoid:ApplyDescription()`. Asset type verification determines if
  ApplyDescription will load models or not. Loading models can be insecure if
  it's possible for malicious users to trick your game into loading unexpected
  models that you own which may include malicious scripts. You should set this
  to Always unless you want to load non-catalog assets.
