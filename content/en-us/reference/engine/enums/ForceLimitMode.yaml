  - name: Magnitude
    value: 0
    summary: |
      A single number is used to specify the magnitude of the maximum constraint
      force. The constraint will ensure that the force it applies will have a
      magnitude that is less than this limit.

  - name: PerAxis
    value: 1
    summary: |
      A vector is used to specify the maximum force value along each axis of a
      given reference frame. The constraint will ensure that each component of
      the force will have an absolute value that's less than the corresponding
      vector entry.
