    summary: |
      Text is truncated at the end of the text; extra graphemes that cannot fit
      into the space are replaced with `...`. Word boundaries are respected if
      possible.

      For example, if the control is between -> and <- like so:

      `->Long text is truncated at the en<-d of the last complete word`

      The text will be:

      `Long text is truncated at the...`

      space are replaced with `...`.

      For example, if the control is between -> and <- like so:

      `->Long text is truncated at the en<-d of the last complete word`

      The text will be:
