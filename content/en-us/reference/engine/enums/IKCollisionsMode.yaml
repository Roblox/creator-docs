      Only the part and any parts directly joined to it via
      joints/`Class.Constraint|constraints` be involved in the resolution,
      everything else in the workspace will be treated as though it doesn't

    summary: |

    summary: |
      The part, any parts directly joined to it via
      joints/`Class.Constraint|constraints`, and any parts which it comes into
      contact with during the solve will be moved during the resolution. That
      is, the moved parts will be allowed to "push" other unanchored parts in
      the workspace out of the way in order to get to the target position.
