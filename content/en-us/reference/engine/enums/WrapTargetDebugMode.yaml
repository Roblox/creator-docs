  The Studio-only property for quickly visualizing and debugging meshes with
  only outer cages.

  This debug visualization only works when the WrapTarget is active and does not
  work if WrapTarget is not active or incorrectly configured.

    summary: |
      This debug rendering mode does nothing, and this is the default value.

  - name: TargetCageOriginal
    summary: |
      This debug mode shows the original cage mesh as it was created.

  - name: TargetCageCompressed
    summary: |
      This debug mode shows corresponding cage mesh compressed by clothing
      layers above it. This debug mode is intended to validate that the
      compression algorithm and corresponding cages work as intended.

  - name: TargetCageInterface
    summary: |
      This debug mode shows the resulting cage mesh for the corresponding Wrap
      Instance. This debug mode is intended to validate that the final deformed
      cage looks as intended.

    summary: |
      The same as TargetCageOriginal but affects all WrapTargets that belong to
      the Wrap Deformer simultaneously. It doesn't matter which particular
      WrapTarget you enable this debug visualization option.

    summary: |
      The same as TargetCageCompressed but affects all WrapTargets that belong
      to the Wrap Deformer simultaneously. It doesn't matter which particular
      WrapTarget you enable this debug visualization option.

  - name: Rbf
    summary: |
      This debug mode visualizes the internal RBF solver state. You can estimate
      the wrap deformer expected behavior by looking at this state. All
      renderable mesh vertices move from a "big sphere" to a "small sphere"
      along a corresponding line connecting two spheres.
