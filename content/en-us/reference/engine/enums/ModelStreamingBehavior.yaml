    summary: |
      Models are sent when their parent is sent, typically during player join. Models are never
      streamed out unless an ancestor of the model is streamed out.

    summary: |
      Models are never sent during player join. Models that are "non-spatial" (containing no `Class.BasePart`
      descendants) are sent soon after join, but before the `Class.Workspace.PersistentLoaded` event
      fires. Models that are "spatial" (containing `Class.BasePart` descendants) are sent when any
      `Class.BasePart` descendant needs to be streamed to a client, and may stream out when all
      `Class.BasePart` descendants are eligible to stream out.
