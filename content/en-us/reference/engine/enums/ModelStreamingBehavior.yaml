    summary: |
      Models are sent when their parent is sent, typically during player join.
      Models are never streamed out unless an ancestor of the model is streamed
      out.

    summary: |
      Models are never sent during player join. Models that are "non-spatial"
      (containing no `Class.BasePart` descendants) are sent soon after join, but
      before the `Class.Workspace.PersistentLoaded` event fires. Models that are
      "spatial" (containing `Class.BasePart` descendants) are sent when any
      `Class.BasePart` descendant needs to be streamed to a client, and may
      stream out when all `Class.BasePart` descendants are eligible to stream
      out.
