  Used as an enum value for `Class.Workspace.FluidForces` to control the
  enablement of aerodynamic forces on parts and assemblies in the workspace.
  Note that this enum is not applicable in scripting and
  `Class.Workspace.FluidForces` must be toggled in Studio.

    summary: |
      Aerodynamic forces will be calculated on `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` with
      `Class.BasePart.EnableFluidForces|EnableFluidForces` set to true. During
      the beta phase, the behavior of the aerodynamic force model may change as
      the model improves.
