deprecation_message: |
  **SurfaceType** joining is deprecated, leaving only visual changes on the
  affected `Class.Part`. It should not be used for future work.
items:
  - name: Smooth

  - name: Studs
    summary: |
      Adds square studs across the surface.
    value: 3

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Inlet
    summary: |
      Adds square holes across the surface where studs would be.
    value: 4

  - name: Universal
    summary: |
      Adds a checker pattern to the surface using studs and inlets.
    value: 5

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Hinge
    summary: |
      Adds a yellow hinge to the surface. Parts touching it stick to the
      surface, allowing for rotations using physics. This should not be used for
      future work and existing instances should be replaced with a
      `Class.HingeConstraint`.
    value: 6
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Motor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a hinge with the addition of a grey ring.
    value: 7

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: SteppingMotor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a motor. It may have functioned differently in
      the past, but that functionality is non-existent.
    value: 8
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: SmoothNoOutlines
    summary: |
      Previously similar to **Smooth** with outlines but no longer relevant
      since outlines have been removed.
