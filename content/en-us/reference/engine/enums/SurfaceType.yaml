  Used to determine how a surface should be displayed on a part and how
  automatic surface joints should behave.

  ## Surface behavior

  When surface joining is on, all planar touching surfaces of a `Class.Part` will weld together, regardless of SurfaceType. This does not affect Hinge, Motor, or SteppingMotor.

  - Glue, Studs, Inlets, Universal, Weld, and Smooth surfaces will all create
    Weld instances
  - Spheres will not surface-weld to anything. The rounded sides of cylinders
    will not surface-weld, but the flat end sides will.

  ## Surface appearance

  Stud, Inlet, Universal, Weld, and Glue Surface textures only appear on plastic material parts, both in-game and in Studio.

  See also:

  - `Class.Workspace:JoinToOutsiders()`, creates joints between the specified
    parts and any touching parts depending on the parts' surfaces and the
    specified joint creation mode
  - `Enum.JointCreationMode`, the way joints are created between two surfaces

deprecation_message: |
  SurfaceType based joining is deprecated, leaving only visual changes to the effected 'Class.Part'. This should not be used for future work.

      Adds an X pattern across the surface.

  - name: Studs
    summary: |
      Adds square studs across the surface.
    value: 3
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Inlet
    summary: |
      Adds square holes across the surface where studs would be.
    value: 4

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Universal
    summary: |
      Adds a checker pattern to the surface using Studs and Intlets.
    value: 5
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Hinge
    summary: |
      Adds a yellow hinge to the surface. Parts touching it would stick to the surface allowing for rotations using physics. This should not be used for future work, and should be replaced with a `Class.HingeConstraint` instead.
    value: 6
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Motor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a hinge with the addition of a grey ring.
    value: 7
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: SteppingMotor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a motor. It may have functioned differently in
      the past, but that functionality is non-existant.
    value: 8
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: SmoothNoOutlines
    summary: |
      Same as Smooth, but removed the _outlines_ of the surface. This no longer
      functions as outlines have been removed.
