  **SurfaceType** joining is deprecated, leaving only visual changes on the
  affected `Class.Part`. It should not be used for future work.

  - name: Hinge
    summary: |
      Adds a yellow hinge to the surface. Parts touching it stick to the surface,
      allowing for rotations using physics. This should not be used for future
      work and existing instances should be replaced with a
      `Class.HingeConstraint`.
    value: 6

  - name: Motor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a hinge with the addition of a grey ring.

  - name: SteppingMotor
    summary: |
      Functioned identically to a motor. It may have functioned differently in
      the past, but that functionality is non-existent.
