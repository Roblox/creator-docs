  Used to determine how a surface should be displayed on a part and how
  automatic surface joints should behave.

  ## Surface behavior

  When surface joining is on, all planar touching flat sides of parts will weld
  together, regardless of SurfaceType. This does not affect Hinge, Motor,
  SteppingMotor.

  - Glue, Studs, Inlets, Universal, Weld, and Smooth surfaces will all create
    Weld instances
  - Spheres will not surface-weld to anything. The rounded sides of cylinders
    will not surface-weld, but the flat end sides will.

  ## Surface appearance

  Stud, Inlet, Universal, Weld, and Glue Surface textures only appear on plastic
  material parts, both in-game and in Studio.

  See also:

  - `Class.Workspace:JoinToOutsiders()`, creates joints between the specified
    parts and any touching parts depending on the parts' surfaces and the
    specified joint creation mode
  - `Enum.JointCreationMode`, the way joints are created between two surfaces

  - name: Universal
    summary: |
      Makes the side appear with both Studs and Inlets in a checker pattern.

  - name: Hinge
    summary: |
      Makes the side appear with a yellow hinge. Any part connected to this
      hinge will stick to the side and rotate using physics, however, using
      `Class.HingeConstraint` to join parts is preferred.
    value: 6

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Motor
    summary: |
      Acts the same as a Hinge, but has a grey ring around it and automatically
      rotates any part connected to it, however, using `Class.HingeConstraint`
      to join parts is preferred.

  - name: SteppingMotor
    summary: |
      Functions identically to a motor. It may have functioned differently in
      the past, but that functionality no longer seems to exist.
    value: 8

  - name: SmoothNoOutlines
    summary: |
      Same as Smooth, but removes the _outlines_ of the surface.
