  This enum determines the level of detail that
  [meshes](../../../parts/meshes.md) and
  [solid modeled](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) parts will be shown in. The
  default is **Automatic**, meaning the object's detail is based on its distance
  from the camera as outlined in the following table.

  <table>
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <th>Distance From Camera</th>
              <th>Render Fidelity</th>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td>Less than 250 studs</td>
              <td>Highest</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>250 to 500 studs</td>
              <td>Medium</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>500 or more studs</td>
              <td>Lowest</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>

  - name: Performance
    summary: |
      Push performance as much as possible, trying to maintain quality if
      possible, and discarding appearance if that's necessary to reach
      performance. This means that the performance will always be excellent, but
      mesh visuals may be affected negatively.
