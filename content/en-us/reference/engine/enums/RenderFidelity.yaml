  This enum determines the level of detail that solid modeled and mesh parts
  will be shown in.

  By default, solid modeled and mesh parts will always be shown in precise
  fidelity, no matter how far they are from the game camera. This improves their
  appearance when viewed from any distance, but if a place has a large number of
  detailed solid modeled or mesh parts, it may reduce overall game performance.

  - name: Performance
    summary: |
      Push performance as much as possible, trying to maintain quality if
      possible, and discarding appearance if that's necessary to reach
      performance. This means that the performance will always be excellent, but
      mesh visuals may be affected negatively.
