    summary: |
      No insets are added to the fullscreen area. This mode may result in UI
      that is obscured or completely hidden by device notches and cutouts, so
      you should only use it for a `Class.ScreenGui` that contains
      noninteractive content like background images.

  - name: DeviceSafeInsets
    value: 1
    summary: |
      Device safe area insets are added to the fullscreen area. The resulting
      area is guaranteed to not be occluded by any **device** screen cutouts
      such as the camera notch, although no inset is added for Roblox core UI
      elements like the top bar buttons. As such, it's recommended that you use
      **CoreUISafeInsets** for a `Class.ScreenGui` whose contents should remain
      unobscured by both device cutouts **and** core screen elements.

    value: 2
    summary: |
      Core UI insets are added to the **DeviceSafeInsets** area, resulting in an
      area guaranteed to be unobscured by both device screen cutouts and Roblox
      core UI elements like the top bar buttons. This mode is recommended for
      any `Class.ScreenGui` that contains interactive and/or important UI
      elements such as buttons and status messages.

  - name: TopbarSafeInsets
    summary: |
      Top bar safe area insets are added to the **DeviceSafeInsets** area,
      resulting in an area guaranteed to be unobscured by both device screen
      cutouts and Roblox core UI elements like the experience controls. Unlike
      **CoreUISafeInsets**, this area's position and size is dynamic and is
      limited to the space available within the top bar area itself, outside of
      **CoreUISafeInsets**.
