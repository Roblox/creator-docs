    summary: |
      Useful for when a player browses over an object (often a UI object)
      without the intention of triggering its action; it can also alert the
      player that they have browsed over an interactable object. This effect
      type is subtle and does not disrupt the gameplay experience.

      to represent the magnitude of the impact and it lingers for a longer
      period of time than `GameplayCollision`.
