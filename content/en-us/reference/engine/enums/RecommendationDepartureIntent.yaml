name: RecommendationDepartureIntent
type: enum
summary: ''
description: |
  This enum captures the user's intent when leaving a view—whether the
  experience was neutral, positive, or negative. While longer views can
  sometimes suggest higher engagement, duration alone isn't a reliable signal.
  For example, a user might quickly see what they need and immediately teleport
  through the item. Even though the view time is short, the swift, purposeful
  action indicates a positive departure intent.
