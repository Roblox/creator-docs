    summary: |
      Behavior depends on the value of
      `Class.VoiceChatService.EnableDefaultVoice` and
      `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi`. When using the default voice setup
      with the audio API, this behaves similarly to `Camera`.

      All of the following, resulting in the world being heard from the position
      of your character while matching the orientation of your camera.

      - An `Class.Attachment` will be created and parented to the
        `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart` of the local player's
        `Class.Player.Character|Character` model.

      - An `Class.AudioListener` will be created and parented to the
        `Class.Attachment`.

      - An `Class.AudioDeviceOutput` will be created and parented to
        `Class.SoundService`.

      - A `Class.Wire` will be created and parented to the previously-created
        `Class.AudioListener`. The wire's
        `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance` will be set to the
        previously-created `Class.AudioListener` and its
        `Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance` will be set to the
        previously-created `Class.AudioDeviceOutput`.

      - The previously-created `Class.Attachment` will be updated once per frame
        to face the same direction as `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.
