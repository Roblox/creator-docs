name: VoiceChatDistanceAttenuationType
type: enum
summary: |
  Enum used for preset distance attenuation curve options in the default voice
  chat setup.
description: |
  Each value in this enum represents a distance attenuation curve that can be
  used by `Class.VoiceChatService` when creating the default voice chat setup
  using `Class.AudioDeviceInput` and `Class.AudioEmitter` objects.

items:
  - name: Inverse
    summary: |
      Represents a distance attenuation curve that follows the inverse-squared
      law. This is identical to the default distance attenuation of an
      `Class.AudioEmitter` instance.
    value: 0

  - name: Legacy
    summary: |
      Represents a linear-squared distance attenuation curve with a minimum
      distance of `7` and a maximum distance of `80`. This is identical to the
      distance attenuation used in the internal-only default voice setup that
      does not use `Class.AudioDeviceInput` and `Class.AudioEmitter` objects.
