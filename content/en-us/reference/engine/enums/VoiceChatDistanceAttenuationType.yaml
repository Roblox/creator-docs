  - name: Legacy
    summary: |
      Represents a linear-squared distance attenuation curve with a minimum
      distance of `7` and a maximum distance of `80`. This is identical to the
      distance attenuation used in the internal-only default voice setup that
      does not use `Class.AudioDeviceInput` and `Class.AudioEmitter` objects.
