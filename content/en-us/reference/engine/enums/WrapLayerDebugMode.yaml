  The Studio-only property for quickly visualizing and debugging meshes with
  inner and outer cages.

  This debug visualization only works when the WrapLayer is active and does not
  work if WrapLayer is not active or incorrectly configured.

      This debug rendering mode does nothing. This is the default value.

  - name: BoundCage
    value: 1
    summary: |
      This debug mode visualizes corresponding cage mesh vertices bound to an
      underlying `Class.WrapTarget`. In order to find corresponding vertices
      between different cages, the Wrap Deformer algorithm uses UV matching. As
      long as your `Class.WrapLayer` cage mesh share the same UV layout as
      `Class.WrapTarget`, its vertices will be marked as "bound".

  - name: LayerCage
    value: 2
    summary: |
      This debug mode shows the resulting layer mesh as a whole. The deformer
      will use vertex locations from the previous layer for all unbound
      vertices.

  - name: BoundCageAndLinks
    value: 3
    summary: |
      The same as BoundCage but also visualizes how bound vertices were moved.
      You can use this mode to identify where they belong on a previous layer
      and where they are located on the current layer.

    summary: |
      This debug mode shows the original inner cage mesh as it was created.

  - name: Rbf
    value: 5
    summary: |
      This debug mode visualizes the internal RBF solver state. You can estimate
      the wrap deformer's expected behavior by looking at this state. All
      renderable mesh vertices move from a "big sphere" to a "small sphere"
      along a corresponding line connecting two spheres.

      This debug mode shows the original outer cage mesh as it was created.
