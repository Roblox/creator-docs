  Used with `Class.UIFlexItem.FlexMode` to define how the parent
  `Class.GuiObject` grows or shrinks with available space in the container.

  - name: None
    summary: |
      The parent `Class.GuiObject` is unaffected and neither shrinks nor grows.

  - name: Grow
    summary: |
      Sets an effective `1:0` grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`.
      Objects set to `Grow` never shrink below their basis size, so overflow may
      occur if the container becomes smaller than the flex line's combined basis
      size.
    value: 1

  - name: Shrink
    summary: |
      Sets an effective `0:1` grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`.
      Objects set to `Shrink` never grow above their basis size, so underflow
      may occur if the container becomes larger than the flex line's combined
      basis size.
    value: 2

    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Fill
    summary: |
      Sets an effective `1:1` grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`.
      This setting ensures the flex line always fills the container, even if the
      container size changes.
    value: 3
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Custom
    summary: |
      Enables the `Class.UIFlexItem.GrowRatio|GrowRatio` and
      `Class.UIFlexItem.ShrinkRatio|ShrinkRatio` properties for the
      `Class.UIFlexItem`, allowing for relative growth or shrinking of the
      parent `Class.GuiObject` in a ratio compared to other flex objects also
      under control of a `Class.UIFlexItem`.
