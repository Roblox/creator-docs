  - name: Grow
    summary: |
      Sets an effective **1:0** grow‑shrink ratio on the parent
      `Class.GuiObject`. Objects set to **Grow** never shrink below their basis
      size, so overflow may occur if the container becomes smaller than the flex
      line's combined basis size.

  - name: Shrink
    summary: |
      Sets an effective **0:1** grow‑shrink ratio on the parent
      `Class.GuiObject`. Objects set to **Shrink** never grow above their basis
      size, so underflow may occur if the container becomes larger than the flex
      line's combined basis size.

  - name: Fill
    summary: |
      Sets an effective **1:1** grow‑shrink ratio on the parent
      `Class.GuiObject`. This setting ensures the flex line always fills the
      container, even if the container size changes.

    summary: |
      Enables the `Class.UIFlexItem.GrowRatio|GrowRatio` and
      `Class.UIFlexItem.ShrinkRatio|ShrinkRatio` properties for the
      `Class.UIFlexItem`, allowing for relative growth or shrinking of the
      parent `Class.GuiObject` in a ratio compared to other flex objects also
      under control of a `Class.UIFlexItem`.
