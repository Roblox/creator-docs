  - name: FullscreenExtension
    summary: |
      If the total area of any descendant `Class.GuiObject` within the
      `Class.ScreenGui` (including any applied border or `Class.UIStroke`)
      covers the device's safe area both horizontally and vertically, its
      background area will be expanded to cover the fullscreen area. This
      expansion does **not** affect the size or position of the descendant's
      **content**, except in the case of `Class.ImageLabel`,
      `Class.ImageButton`, or `Class.VideoFrame` where the image/video is
      considered part of the background and will be expanded to fullscreen.

      Note that this option is intended to automatically improve the appearance
      of UI that was authored for screens without any cutouts. However, it's
      recommended that you avoid fullscreen extensions for new work; instead,
      use the `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` property to specify
      which insets should be respected for different
      `Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis`.
