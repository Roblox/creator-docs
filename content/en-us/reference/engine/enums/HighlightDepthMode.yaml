  - name: AlwaysOnTop
    summary: |
      Allows the `Class.Highlight` to display regardless if there are objects
      between the camera and the highlighted object. This means the viewer is
      always able to see the highlight regardless of what is between the
      highlighted object and the camera.

  - name: Occluded
    summary: |
      Hides the `Class.Highlight` if there are objects between the camera and
      the highlighted object. This means the viewer is only able to see the
      object if there are no obstructing objects between the highlighted object
      and the camera's view.
