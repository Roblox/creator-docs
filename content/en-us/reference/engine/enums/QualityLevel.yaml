name: QualityLevel
type: enum
summary: |
  Controls the rendering quality of the game.
description: |
  Controls the rendering quality of the game. Higher levels correspond to higher
  quality graphics.

  As QualityLevel increases, Roblox rendering engine increases the rendering
  distance, shading quality, apparent geometry and texture resolution, limits on
  particles that are being rendered, fidelity of trail effects, post-effect
  quality and more. On low quality levels some post effects may be completely
  disabled and objects that are far away will not be rendered.

  The specific effects of quality level on the individual elements of the scene
  or individual rendering features are platform- and device- specific and can
  not be relied upon.
