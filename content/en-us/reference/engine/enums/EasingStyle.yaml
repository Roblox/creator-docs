  Passed to `Datatype.TweenInfo|TweenInfo.new()` to control the motion of a
  `Class.Tween`. The following graphs reflect easing styles for
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.In`. For graphs reflecting
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.Out` and
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.InOut`, see
