  Pass to `Datatype.TweenInfo|TweenInfo.new` to control the motion of a
  `Class.Tween`.
description: |
  Passed to `Datatype.TweenInfo|TweenInfo.new` to control the motion of a
  `Class.Tween`. Each easing style is described in a graph below. The X axis is
  a value passed to `Class.TweenService:GetValue()` and the Y axis is the value
  returned.

  This diagram reflects the various styles with
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.In`. Note that for
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.Out`, the easing style is applied
  in a reverse direction.

  For a video demonstration of each easing style, see
  [UI Animations - Style](../../../ui/animation.md#style).
