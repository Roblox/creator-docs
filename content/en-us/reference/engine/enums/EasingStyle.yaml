name: EasingStyle
type: enum
summary: |
  Enum used with `Datatype.TweenInfo|TweenInfo.new` to control the motion of a
  `Class.Tween`.
description: |
  These enum values are passed to `Datatype.TweenInfo|TweenInfo.new()` to
  control the motion of a `Class.Tween`. The following graphs reflect easing
  styles for `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.In`. For graphs
  reflecting `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.Out` and
  `Enum.EasingDirection|Enum.EasingDirection.InOut`, see
  [UI&nbsp;Animations](../../../ui/animation.md#style).

items:
  - name: Linear
    summary: |
      Moves at a constant speed.
    value: 0
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Sine
    summary: |
      Speed is determined by a sine wave for a gentle easing motion.
    value: 1

  - name: Back
    summary: |
      Slightly overshoots the target, then backs into place.
    value: 2
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Quad
    summary: |
      Similar to `Sine` but with a slightly sharper curve based on quadratic
      interpolation.
    value: 3
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Quart
    summary: |
      Similar to `Cubic` but with an even sharper curve based on quartic
      interpolation.
    value: 4
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Quint
    summary: |
      Similar to `Quart` but with an even sharper curve based on quintic
      interpolation.
    value: 5

  - name: Bounce
    summary: |
      Bounces backwards multiple times after reaching the target, before
      eventually settling.
    value: 6
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Elastic
    summary: |
      Moves as if attached to a rubber band, overshooting the target several
      times.
    value: 7
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Exponential
    summary: |
      The sharpest curve based on exponential interpolation.
    value: 8
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Circular
    summary: |
      Follows a circular arc, such that acceleration is more sudden and
      deceleration more gradual versus `Quint` or `Exponential`.
    value: 9
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Cubic
    summary: |
      Similar to `Quad` but with a slightly sharper curve based on cubic
      interpolation.
