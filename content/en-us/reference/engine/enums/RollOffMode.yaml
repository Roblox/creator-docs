name: RollOffMode
type: enum
summary: |
  How `Class.Sound|Sounds` parented to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`
  attenuate (fade out) as the distance between the listener and the parent
  increases.
description: |
  Enum which determines how `Class.Sound|Sounds` parented to a `Class.BasePart`
  or `Class.Attachment` attenuate (fade out) as the distance between the
  listener and the parent increases.

items:
  - name: Inverse
    summary: |
      Volume attenuates from `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance` in an inverse
      manner, mirroring how sounds attenuate in the real world. This is done
      through `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance`/`distance`, where `distance` is
      the `Datatype.Vector3.Magnitude` between the audio source and the audio
      listener.

  - name: Linear
    summary: |
      Volume attenuates between `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance` and
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance` with a linear relationship. This is done
      through
      (`Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance`/`distance`)/(`Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance`-`Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance`),
      where `distance` is the `Datatype.Vector3.Magnitude` between the audio
      source and the audio listener.

  - name: LinearSquare
    summary: |
      Volume attenuates between `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance` and
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance` with a linear squared relationship. This
      is done through squaring `Linear`.

  - name: InverseTapered
    summary: |
      A hybrid model which follows the `Inverse` model when close to
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance` and the `LinearSquare` model when close
      to `Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance`. This is done by taking the lesser of
      `Inverse` and `LinearSquare`.
