  How 3D `Class.Sound|Sounds` attenuate (fade out) as the distance between the
  listener and the Sound's parent increases.

  ## What is Attenuation?

  Acoustic attenuation refers to how sound diminishes as it travels through a
  medium or across increasing distances.

  ## Inverse vs Linear Distance Attenuation

  Inverse distance attenuation (Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse) mirrors how sounds
  attenuate in the real world. Under inverse distance attenuation, sounds will
  begin to attenuate once the distance between the listener and the Sound's
  parent exceeds `Class.Sound.EmitterSize`. The rate of attenuation depends on
  the emitter size, as sounds with larger EmitterSize's will attenuate at a
  slower rate. Inverse rate of inverse distance attenuation is further
  influenced by `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale`.

  Note, `Class.Sound.MaxDistance` will not effect attenuation under the inverse
  model but will cause the sound to cut off completely once this distance is
  reached. This can be particularly abrupt when using low values for max
  distance.

  Linear distance attenuation works differently. Under linear distance
  attenuation the sound will attenuate between EmitterSize and MaxDistance,
  falling silent once MaxDistance is reached. EmitterSize still denotes the
  point at which the sound will begin attenuating. However, the audible volume
  at any point now depends on the point the listener is at between EmitterSize
  and MaxDistance. This means, in contrast to the inverse distance attenuation
  model, the audible volume of the sound will approach silence at MaxDistance
  point. This is less realistic, but may be more desirable in some cases.
