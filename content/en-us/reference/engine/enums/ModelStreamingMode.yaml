  - name: Atomic
    summary: |
      The `Class.Model` and all of its descendants are streamed in/out together.
      For streaming in, this applies when **any** descendant `Class.BasePart` is
      eligible for streaming in. For streaming out, this applies when **all**
      descendant `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are eligible for streaming out.

  - name: Persistent
    summary: |
      Persistent models are sent as a complete atomic unit soon after the player
      joins and before the `Class.Workspace.PersistentLoaded` event fires.
      Persistent models and their descendants are never streamed out.

  - name: PersistentPerPlayer
    summary: |
      Behaves as a persistent model for players that have been added using
      `Class.Model:AddPersistentPlayer()`. For other players, behavior is the
      same as **Atomic**. You can revert a model from player persistence via
      `Class.Model:RemovePersistentPlayer()`.

  - name: Nonatomic
    summary: |
      When a nonatomic model is streamed, descendants are also sent, except for
      part descendants. Nonatomic models that are not descendants of parts are
      sent during experience loading.
