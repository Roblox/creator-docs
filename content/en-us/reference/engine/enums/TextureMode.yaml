  - name: Stretch
    summary: |
      For a `Class.Trail`, the texture will stretch out based on the lifetime of
      the trail, and shrink inwards if the trail's attachments stop moving.

      For a `Class.Beam`, the texture will repeat
      `Class.Beam.TextureLength|TextureLength` times across the beam's overall
      length. See [here](../../../effects/beams.md#texture-lengthmode) for
      details.

  - name: Wrap
    summary: |
      For a `Class.Trail`, the texture will be tiled as the length of the trail
      changes, but the textures will remain stationary relative to their
      attachments.

      For a `Class.Beam`, the texture repetitions will equal the beam's overall
      length (in&nbsp;studs) divided by its
      `Class.Beam.TextureLength|TextureLength`. See
      [here](../../../effects/beams.md#texture-lengthmode) for details.

  - name: Static
    summary: |
      For a `Class.Trail`, the texture will be rolled out as the attachments
      move, and they will remain in place until their lifetime is met. This
      setting is ideal for trail textures that should appear "stamped" where
      rendered, such as paw prints or tire tracks.

      This value is not supported for `Class.Beam` and therefore behaves identically to **Wrap**.
