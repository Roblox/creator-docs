  Enum used by `Class.Lighting.Technology` to represent the different lighting

description: |
  This enum represents the different lighting systems available for rendering
  the 3D world. It is used by the `Class.Lighting.Technology` property.

  Note that `Class.Lighting.Technology` has been superseded by
  `Class.Lighting.LightingStyle|LightingStyle` which determines the artistic
  intent behind lighting, and
  `Class.Lighting.PrioritizeLightingQuality|PrioritizeLightingQuality` which
  indicates whether you prefer lighting/shading quality or view distance to
  scale down first.
