    summary: |
      The engine will automatically decide if this instance should be predicted
      or not. Currently, only `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` near the local player
      character's `Class.Humanoid` will be predicted within a dynamic radius
      that grows and shrinks based on the device's capability to handle the
      simulation load.

  - name: 'On'
    summary: |
      The instance will be predicted. Mismatches in the attributes of this
      instance between the client and server will cause a rollback and
      resimulation. If the instance is a `Class.BasePart`, its physics
      properties will be predicted ahead of the replicated authoritative server
      state.

  - name: 'Off'
    summary: |
      The instance will **not** be predicted. Regular network ownership
      semantics apply.
