name: UserInputState
type: enum
summary: |
  This enum describes the state of an input that is currently or was recently
  performed.
description: |
  The `UserInputState` enum describes the state of an input that is currently or
  was recently performed. It is used by the `Class.InputObject.UserInputState`
  property of the same name, as well as various `Class.UserInputService` and
  `Class.GuiObject` events.

  Depending on the `Enum.UserInputType`, input may follow states differently:

  - Simple button and key presses generally follow a simple `Begin` to `End`
    flow. Analog gamepad trigger buttons are similar to button presses but will
    use `Change` as the trigger pressure changes.
  - Mouse movement generally follows `Begin` (mouse-over) to `Change` (mouse
    movement) to `End` (mouse-leave).
  - Touch input behaves somewhat similarly to mouse movement. `Begin` and `End`
    occur when the user starts or ends touching the screen, respectively. The
    same `Class.InputObject` is used for the same touch point.
  - Gamepad thumbstick controls will cause `Change` to occur each frame the
    position changes.

items:
  - name: Begin
    summary: |
      Occurs when an `Class.InputObject` starts to interact with the experience.
      For example, a mouse button down, a key down, or when the player begins
      touching the screen.
    value: 0
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Change
    summary: |
      Occurs each frame an `Class.InputObject` has already begun interacting
      with the experience and part of its state is changing. For example,
      movement of the mouse position, a gamepad thumbstick movement, an analog
      gamepad trigger button change, or screen touch point change.
    value: 1
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: End
    summary: |
      Occurs when an `Class.InputObject` finishes interacting with the
      experience. For example, a mouse button up, a key up, or when the player
      stops touching the screen.
    value: 2
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: Cancel
    summary: |
      A special circumstance state that indicates this input is no longer
      relevant, particularly with `Class.ContextActionService`. For example,
      binding two action-handling functions will cause the first to `Cancel` if
      an input was already in-progress when the second was bound.
    value: 3
    tags: []
    deprecation_message: ''
  - name: None
    summary: |
      A state that should never be seen in an experience; essentially just marks
      the end of the enum.
