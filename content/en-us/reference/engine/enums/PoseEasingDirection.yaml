name: PoseEasingDirection
type: enum
summary: |
  Used exclusively by Pose.EasingDirection to specify direction of the
  EasingStyle curve.
description: |
  When a Pose has an EasingStyle which is not symmetric, the EasingDirection
  determines if the curve is applied from previous keyframe to next, next
  keyframe to previous, or in both directions by using two copies of the curve
  back to back. For the symmetric Linear and Constant EasingStyles, this
  property has no effect. For legacy compatibility reasons, the use of In and
  Out are backwards from how these terms are used by most other animation tools
  and by TweenService.
