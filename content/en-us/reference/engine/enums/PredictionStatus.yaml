  Enum used with `Class.RunService:GetPredictionStatus()` to check the status of
  a specific instance.

  This prediction status can be used to determine whether any associated scripts
  should run. If the status is `Authoritative` or `Predicted`, such scripts
  should run, since the local node is either the authority for the instance or
  is predicting it. If the status is `None`, such scripts do not need to run.
