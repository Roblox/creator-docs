  - name: Default
    summary: |
      Collision model uses a voxel-based convex-hull decomposition that is
      relatively fast but may not be highly accurate, especially for holes,
      doorways, and cavities in general.

    summary: |
      Collison model uses a convex-hull decomposition of the visual mesh which
      is computed by a variation of an algorithm called HACD. This option is the
      most accurate representation of collision geometry for complex objects
      with built-in tolerances to reduce the total number of convex-hulls by
      compromising on accuracy when justified.
