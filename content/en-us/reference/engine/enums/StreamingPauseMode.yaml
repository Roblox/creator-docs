name: StreamingPauseMode
type: enum
summary: |
  Determines how a Players client should handle not having enough content
  streamed in to continue playing properly.
description: |
  The StreamingPauseMode enum is used to control
  `Class.Workspace.StreamingPauseMode` behavior.

  Default behavior is currently equivalent to disabled, but may change in the
  future.

  The disabled mode indicates that gameplay continues unchanged even if player
  does not have the minimum streaming radius available.

  In ClientPhysicsPause mode client-side physics is paused when the player
  doesn't have the minimum radius present, and resumed when the minimum radius
  is available.

  See also:

  - `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled`, controls whether network streaming is
    enabled for the place or not
  - `Class.Workspace.StreamingMinRadius`, the minimum distance that parts will
    be streamed to players with high priority
  - `Class.Workspace.StreamingTargetRadius`, the maximum distance that parts
    will be streamed to players
