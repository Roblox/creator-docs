summary: |
  Describes the channel layout of an audio stream.
description: |
  The `AudioChannelLayout` enum describes the channel layout of an audio stream.
  Audio streams contain one or more channels that are intended to be rendered
  simultaneously with a particular arrangement of speakers. In general, more
  channels impact performance but provide higher spatial quality.

  - name: Mono
    summary: |
      Monaural audio streams contain only one **Center** channel.

  - name: Stereo
    summary: |
      Stereophonic audio streams consist of two channels: **Left** and
      **Right**.

  - name: Quad
    summary: |
      Quadrophonic audio streams consist of four channels: **Left**, **Right**,
      **BackLeft**, and **BackRight**. Quadrophonic streams can encode
      forward/backward spatial information that stereo streams might struggle
      with.

  - name: Surround_5
    summary: |
      Surround sound audio streams consist of five channels: **Left**,
      **Right**, **Center**, **BackLeft**, and **BackRight**. Surround sound
      streams encode spatial information with better resolution front and
      center.

  - name: Surround_5_1
    summary: |
      5.1 surround sound consists of six channels: **Left**, **Right**,
      **Center**, **BackLeft**, **BackRight**, and a **Sub** (subsonic)
      low‑frequency channel. 5.1 surround sound benefits from low frequencies
      being less directional in order to encode higher resolution spatial
      information versus simple 5‑channel surround sound.

  - name: Surround_7_1
    summary: |
      7.1 surround sound consists of eight channels: **Left**, **Right**,
      **Center**, **SurroundLeft**, **SurroundRight**, **BackLeft**,
      **BackRight**, and a **Sub** (subsonic) low‑frequency channel. 7.1
      surround sound is an improvement over 5.1 surround sound, offering better
      spatial resolution directly to the left and right as well.

    summary: |
      7.1.4 surround sound consists of twelve channels: **Left**, **Right**,
      **Center**, **SurroundLeft**, **SurroundRight**, **BackLeft**,
      **BackRight**, **Sub**, **TopLeft**, **TopRight**, **TopBackLeft**, and
      **TopBackRight**. 7.1.4 is the only currently supported channel layout
      that encodes height information.
