description: |
  The **CameraMode** enum is used to set `Class.Player.CameraMode` to determine
  when first person and third person cameras should be used.

  #### Third Person

  In the default third person mode (`Enum.CameraMode|Classic`), the character
  can be seen in the camera. While in this mode, the default behavior is:

  - Players can right-click and drag (mouse), tap and drag (mobile), use the
    secondary thumbstick (gamepad), or press the left/right arrows (keyboard) to
    rotate the camera around their character.
  - When a player moves their character, it faces in the corresponding movement
    direction.
  - Players can zoom in and out freely, even to first person on full zoom in.

  #### First Person

  In first person mode (`Enum.CameraMode|LockFirstPerson`), the player's camera
  is zoomed all the way in. Unless there is a visible GUI present with the
  `Class.GuiButton.Modal` property set to `true`, moving the mouse, tap-dragging
  on mobile, or using the secondary thumbstick on a gamepad will rotate the
  camera around the character.
