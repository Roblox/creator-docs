  ## First-person

  In first-person mode, the player's camera is zoomed all the way in. Unless
  there is a visible GUI present with the `Class.GuiButton.Modal` property set
  to _true_, the mouse will be locked and the user's camera will turn as the
  mouse moves.

  ## Third-person

  In third-person mode, the character can be seen in the camera. While in
  third-person mode on Roblox:

  - You may right-click and drag to rotate your camera, or use the arrow keys at
    the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
  - When you move your mouse, your camera does not change (unless you move the
    mouse to the end of the screen).
  - When you press any of the arrow keys, the user's character will face in the
    corresponding arrow key's direction.
  - You can zoom in and out freely.

  Third-person is the default camera setting.
