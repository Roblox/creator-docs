  - name: Loop
    summary: |
      Continuously play through all frames, starting back at the first frame
      after playing the last.

  - name: OneShot
    summary: |
      Play through the animation only once across the particle's lifetime. With
      this setting, the `Class.ParticleEmitter.FlipbookFramerate` property
      doesn't apply; instead, the framerate is determined by the particle's
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` divided evenly by the number of frames in
      the animation. **OneShot** animations are useful for clear non-repeating
      animations, such as an explosion that creates a puff of smoke and then
      fades out.

  - name: PingPong
    summary: |
      Play from the first to the last frame, then in reverse from the last to
      the first, repeating throughout the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` of
      the particle.
    value: 2

  - name: Random
    summary: |
      Play the frames in a random order, blending/crossfading from one frame to
      the next. This can be useful for organic particle textures at low
      framerates, such as stars slowly twinkling between subtly different
      shapes.
