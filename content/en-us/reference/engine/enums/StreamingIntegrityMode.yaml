name: StreamingIntegrityMode
type: enum
summary: |
  Determines how a user's client should handle not having enough content
  streamed in.
description: |
  This enum is used to control `Class.Workspace.StreamingIntegrityMode`
  behavior. The default behavior is currently equivalent to **Disabled** but may
  change in the future. For all modes, the replication focus defaults to be the
  local character model unless explicitly set via
  `Class.Player.ReplicationFocus`.

  Most experiences should use **PauseOutsideLoadedArea**, however if your
  experience relies on raycasts, or otherwise requires a certain amount of
  content to be loaded in, then **MinimumRadiusPause** might be a better choice.

  Note that **MinimumRadiusPause** and **PauseOutsideLoadedArea** both set the
  `Class.Player.GameplayPaused` property when their respective pause logic is
  triggered, and a default message is displayed on the client. The default pause
  UI can be overridden as outlined in
  [Instance Streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md).
