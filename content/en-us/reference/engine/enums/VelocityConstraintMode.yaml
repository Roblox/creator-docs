name: VelocityConstraintMode
type: enum
summary: |
  The velocity constraint mode property controls how the linear velocity of the
  attachment(s) is constrained.
description: |
  The velocity constraint mode sets how the attachment velocity is constrained.
  The velocity can be constrained to a line, a plane or a vector. See each mode
  for more details.

items:
  - name: Line
    summary: |
      The velocity component in the direction of the line is constrained to the
      specified value. The line direction is based on the
      `Class.LinearVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` property:

      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment0` - The line direction is the
        primary axis of `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1` - The line direction is the
        primary axis of `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World` - The line direction must be specified.

  - name: Plane
    summary: |
      The velocity components in the plane are constrained to the specified
      values. The plane tangents are based on the
      `Class.LinearVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` property:

      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment0` - The plane tangents are the two
        axes of `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1` - The plane tangents are the two
        axes of `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World` - The two plane tangents must be
        specified
    value: 1

  - name: Vector
    summary: |
      The velocity components must be equal to the vector components specified.
      The coordinate system of the vector is based on the
      `Class.LinearVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` property:

      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment0` - The vector components are in the
        coordinate system defined by the axes of
        `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1` - The vector components are in the
        coordinate system defined by the axes of
        `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1`.
      - `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World` - The coordinate system is in the world
        and the vector components must be specified.
