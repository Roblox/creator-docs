  - name: Bool
    summary: |
      The `Class.InputAction` will receive boolean values from button inputs,
      for example `true`/`false` on press/release from inputs such as
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA` or `Enum.KeyCode.E`. This setting also exposes the
      `Class.InputBinding.UIButton|UIButton` property on child
      `Class.InputBinding|InputBindings`, allowing you to easily hook up press
      or release of a `Class.GuiButton` for the action.

    summary: |
      The `Class.InputAction` will receive numerical values, generally from
      analog gamepad triggers such as `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonL2` or
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonR2`. This setting also exposes the
      `Class.InputBinding.Up|Up` and `Class.InputBinding.Down|Down` properties
      on child `Class.InputBinding|InputBindings`, allowing for boolean inputs
      or "1D" inputs as composite directions for the action.

    summary: |
      The `Class.InputAction` will receive `Datatype.Vector2` values, generally
      from thumbstick inputs such as `Enum.KeyCode.Thumbstick1` and
      `Enum.KeyCode.Thumbstick2`. This setting also exposes the
      `Class.InputBinding.Up|Up`, `Class.InputBinding.Down|Down`,
      `Class.InputBinding.Left|Left`, and `Class.InputBinding.Right|Right`
      properties on child `Class.InputBinding|InputBindings`, allowing for "2D"
      inputs as composite directions for the action.

    summary: |
      The `Class.InputAction` will receive `Datatype.Vector3` values from inputs
      assigned to the `Class.InputBinding.Up|Up`,
      `Class.InputBinding.Down|Down`, `Class.InputBinding.Left|Left`,
      `Class.InputBinding.Right|Right`, `Class.InputBinding.Forward|Forward`,
      and/or `Class.InputBinding.Backward|Backward` properties on child
      `Class.InputBinding|InputBindings`, allowing for "3D" inputs as composite
      directions for the action.
