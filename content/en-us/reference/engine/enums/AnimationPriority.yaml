name: AnimationPriority
type: enum
summary: |
  The AnimationPriority Enum determines how concurrently-playing AnimationTracks
  contribute to the final animation.
description: |
  When multiple AnimationTracks are played concurrently by the same Animator and
  affect the same animated joints, the tracks are evaluated in order from high
  to low priority, per joint, while the total track weight sum remains less than
  1.0. When the track weight sum reaches or exceeds 1.0 for a joint, evaluation
  stops and no lower-priority tracks will be evaluated for that joint.
  AnimationTracks with the same priority that are playing concurrently will
  blend proportional to their track weights (normalized if the sum exceeds 1).

  Higher priority animation will override lower priority ones per joint. The
  priority order is: <br /> 1. Action4 (Highest Priority) <br /> 2. Action3
  <br /> 3. Action2 <br /> 4. Action <br /> 5. Movement <br /> 6. Idle <br /> 7.
  Core (Lowest Priority)

  Roblox's default character animations, including catalog animation bundles,
  play at Core priority. Idle through Action4 priority are for developer use.
