name: AnimationPriority
type: enum
summary: |
  The AnimationPriority Enum determines how concurrently-playing AnimationTracks
  contribute to the final animation.
description: |
  When multiple `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` are played concurrently
  by the same `Class.Animator` and affect the same animated joints, the tracks
  are evaluated in order from high to low priority, per joint, while the total
  track weight sum remains less than 1.0. When the track weight sum reaches or
  exceeds 1.0 for a joint, evaluation stops and no lower-priority tracks will be
  evaluated for that joint. `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` with the same
  priority that are playing concurrently will blend proportional to their track
  weights (normalized if the sum exceeds 1).

  Higher priority animation will override lower priority ones per joint. The
  priority order is:

  1. **Action4**
  2. **Action3**
  3. **Action2**
  4. **Action**
  5. **Movement**
  6. **Idle**
  7. **Core**

  Roblox's default character animations, including catalog animation bundles,
  play at **Core** priority. **Idle** through **Action4** priority are for
  developer use.
