summary: |
  This library provides functions related to time and date.
description: |
  This library currently serves the purpose of providing information about the
  system time under the UTC format. It has been heavily sandboxed from the
  standard Lua `Library.os` library and does not allow you to perform any
  system-altering operations.

functions:
  - name: os.time
    summary: |
      Returns how many seconds have passed since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970,
      00:00:00) under current UTC time.
    description: |
      Returns how many seconds have passed since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970,
      00:00:00), under current UTC time. If provided a table formatted similarly
      to that returned by `Library.os.date()`, it will return the number of
      seconds since that time instead.

      ```lua
      print(os.time())  --> 1586982482 (ran at approx. April 15th, 2020 at 1:28 PM PST)
      print(os.time{
          year=2020, month=4, day=15,  -- Date components
          hour=16, min=28, sec=0  -- Time components
      })  --> 1586968080
      ```
    parameters:
      - name: time
        type: table
        default: UTC time
        summary: |
          A dictionary table describing a specific time, similar to that
          returned by `Library.os.date()`. If not provided, uses the current UTC
          time.
    returns:

    summary: |
      Returns the number of seconds from t1 to t2, assuming the arguments are
      correctly casted to the time_t format.
    description: |
      Returns the number of seconds from t1 to t2. The difference is computed
      assuming that t1 and t2 are correctly casted to the
      [time_t](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/time_t) format.

      \* This value can vary depending on the current locale.

      &dagger; The example provided is for February 12th, 2024 (Monday) at
      2:14:35 PM (14:14:35), run using locale "en-us" in Pacific Standard Time
      (PST).

      If the provided `formatString` is exactly `"*t"` (local time) or `"!*t"`
      (UTC time), this function instead returns a dictionary containing the
      following components, which are normally available in the specifiers
