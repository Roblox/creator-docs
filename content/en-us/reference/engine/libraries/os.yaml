name: os
type: library
summary: |
  This library provides functions related to time and date.
description: |
  This library currently serves the purpose of providing information about the
  system time under the UTC format. It has been heavily sandboxed from the
  standard Lua `Library.os` library and does not allow you to perform any
  system-altering operations.

functions:
  - name: os.clock
    summary: |
      Returns elapsed time in seconds since an arbitrary baseline with
      sub-microsecond precision.
    description: |
      Returns elapsed time in seconds since an arbitrary baseline with
      sub-microsecond precision. This function is useful for comparing durations
      between two events that occur on the same computer, and is the best option
      for benchmarking.

      Unlike with functions such as `Library.os.time()` or
      `Datatype.DateTime.now()`, adjustments to the system clock (such as by the
      user or [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)) do not
      cause time to jump forwards or backwards.

      ```lua
      -- Record the initial time:
      local startTime = os.clock()
      -- Do something you want to measure the performance of:
      local a, b = 0, 1
      for _ = 1, 5000000 do
          a, b = b, a
      end
      -- Measure amount of time this took:
      local deltaTime = os.clock() - startTime
      print("Elapsed time: " .. deltaTime)
      -->  Elapsed time: 0.044425600033719 (actual number may vary)
      ```

    summary: |
      Formats the given string with date/time information based on the given
      time.
    description: |
      Formats the given `formatString` with date/time information based on the
      given time, or if not provided, the value returned by `Library.os.time()`.

      This function should be avoided in new work. Instead, use the
      `Datatype.DateTime` API, which supports localized formatting.

      The following specifiers (based on the C function strftime) are supported:

      \* This value can vary depending on the current locale.

      &dagger; The example provided is for February 12th, 2024 (Monday) at
      2:14:35 PM (14:14:35), run using locale "en-us" in Pacific Standard Time
      (PST).

      If the provided `formatString` is exactly `"*t"` (local time) or `"!*t"`
      (UTC time), this function instead returns a dictionary containing the
      following components, which are normally available in the specifiers
      above.

    summary: |
      Returns how many seconds have passed since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970,

    description: |
      Returns how many seconds have passed since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970,
      00:00:00), under current UTC time. If provided a table formatted similarly
      to that returned by `Library.os.date()`, it returns the number of seconds
      from the Unix epoch to that time instead.

      Note that the returned time uses the device's local clock. Most operating
      systems automatically sync their local time against online time servers,
      so this should be within a few hundred milliseconds. However, users can
      easily disable sync behavior and set the system time to anything they
      want; for synchronized time between client and server, use
      `Class.Workspace:GetServerTimeNow()` instead.

      This function should be avoided in new work. Instead, use the
      `Datatype.DateTime` API, which supports localized formatting.

      When you need to precisely measure the time elapsed between two points in
      time, like when testing performance, use `Library.os.clock()` instead.
