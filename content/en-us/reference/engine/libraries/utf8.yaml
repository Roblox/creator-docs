  This library provides basic support for `UTF-8` encoding.

  This library provides basic support for `UTF-8` encoding. This library does
  not provide any support for Unicode other than the handling of the encoding.
  Any operation that needs the meaning of a character, such as character
  classification, is outside its scope.

  Unless stated otherwise, all functions that expect a byte position as a
  parameter assume that the given position is either the start of a byte
  sequence or one plus the length of the subject string. As in the string
  library, negative indices count from the end of the string.

  You can find a large catalog of usable `UTF-8` characters
  [here](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_utf8.asp).

      The pattern `"[%z\x01-\x7F\xC2-\xF4][\x80-\xBF]*"`, which matches exactly
      zero or more UTF-8 byte sequences, assuming that the subject is a valid
      UTF-8 string.

      Converts zero or more codepoints to UTF-8 byte sequences.
    description: |
      Receives zero or more codepoints as integers, converts each one to its
      corresponding UTF-8 byte sequence and returns a string with the
      concatenation of all these sequences.

  - name: utf8.codes
    summary: |
      Returns an iterator function that iterates over all codepoints in a given
      string.
    description: |
      Returns an iterator function so that the construction:

      ```lua
      for position, codepoint in utf8.codes(str) do
      	-- body
      end
      ```

      will iterate over all codepoints in string `str`. It raises an error if it
      meets any invalid byte sequence.
    parameters:
      - name: str
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |

  - name: utf8.codepoint
    summary: |
      Returns the codepoints (as integers) from all codepoints in a given
      string.
    description: |
      Returns the codepoints (as integers) from all codepoints in the provided
      string (str) that start between byte positions `i` and `j` (both
      included). The default for `i` is `1` and for `j` is `i`. It raises an
      error if it meets any invalid byte sequence.
    parameters:
      - name: str
        type: string
        default:
        summary: ''
      - name: i

          The index of the codepoint that should be fetched from this string.
      - name: j
        type: int
        default: i
        summary: |
          The index of the last codepoint between `i` and `j` that will be
          returned. If excluded, this will default to the value of `i`.

  - name: utf8.len
    summary: |
      Returns the number of UTF-8 codepoints in a given string.
    description: |
      Returns the number of UTF-8 codepoints in the string _str_ that start
      between positions `i` and `j` (both inclusive). The default for `i` is `1`
      and for `j` is `-1`. If it finds any invalid byte sequence, returns a nil
      value plus the position of the first invalid byte.
    parameters:
      - name: s
        type: string
        default:
        summary: ''
      - name: i
        type: int

        summary: |
          The starting position.
      - name: j
        type: int
        default: -1
        summary: |
          The ending position.

  - name: utf8.offset
    summary: |
      Returns the position (in bytes) where the encoding of the `n`‑th codepoint
      of `s` (counting from byte position `i`) starts.
    description: |
      Returns the position (in bytes) where the encoding of the `n`‑th codepoint
      of `s` (counting from byte position `i`) starts. A negative `n` gets
      characters before position `i`. The default for `i` is `1` when `n` is
      non-negative and `#s + 1` otherwise, so that `utf8.offset(s, -n)` gets the
      offset of the `n`‑th character from the end of the string. If the
      specified character is neither in the subject nor right after its end, the
      function returns `nil`.
    parameters:
