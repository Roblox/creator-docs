name: buffer
type: library
summary: |
  A library of buffer functions.
description: |
  A buffer is an object that represents a fixed-size mutable block of memory.
  The buffer library provides functions for creation and manipulation of buffer
  objects, providing all its functions inside the global `Library.buffer`
  variable.

  Buffer is intended to be used a low-level binary data storage structure,
  replacing the uses of `Library.string.pack()` and `Library.string.unpack()`.
  Use cases include reading and writing existing binary formats, working with
  data in a more compact form, serialization to custom binary formats, and
  general work with native memory types like fixed-length integers and floats.

  When passed through Roblox APIs, including sending a buffer through custom
  events, the identity of the buffer object is not preserved and the target will
  receive a copy. Similar to other limitations, the same buffer object cannot be
  used from multiple `Class.Actor` scripts (Parallel Luau).

  Many of the functions accept an offset in bytes from the start of the buffer.
  Offset of `0` from the start of the buffer memory block accesses the first
  byte. All offsets, counts and sizes should be non-negative integer numbers. If
  the bytes that are accessed by any read or write operation are outside the
  buffer memory, an error is thrown.

  The `read` and `write` methods that work with integers and floats use
  [little-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) encoding.

      Creates a buffer.
    description: |
      Creates a buffer of the requested size with all bytes initialized to `0`.

      buffers might fail to allocate if device is running low on memory.

    summary: |
      Reads a range of bits into an unsigned integer from the buffer based on a
      specific `bitCount` integer from `0` to `32`, inclusive.
    description: |
      Reads a range of bits into an unsigned integer from the buffer based on a
      specific `bitCount` integer from `0` to `32`, inclusive. For example:

      - `buffer.readbits(b, 0, 8)` is equivalent to
        `Library.buffer.readu8(b, 0)`.
      - `buffer.readbits(b, 0, 16)` is equivalent to
        `Library.buffer.readu16(b, 0)`.
      - `buffer.readbits(b, 0, 32)` is equivalent to
        `Library.buffer.readu32(b, 0)`.
      - `buffer.readbits(b, 0, 24)` reads 24 bits from the buffer.

      Note that `0` bit width is supported only to not error in generalized
      cases where bit count is dynamic, and reading 0 bits returns `0`. Also
      note that, since the max size of the buffer is 1&nbsp;GB, `bitOffset`
      cannot be handled as a 32‑bit integer number like byte offset in other
      buffer functions.

  - name: buffer.copy
    summary: |
      Copies bytes between buffers.
    description: |
      Copies `count` bytes from `source` starting at offset `sourceOffset` into
      the `target` at `targetOffset`.

      It's possible for `source` and `target` to be the same. Copying an
      overlapping region inside the same buffer acts as if the source region is
      copied into a temporary buffer and then that buffer is copied over to the
      target.
    parameters:
      - name: target
        type: buffer
        default:
        summary: |
          Buffer to copy data into.
      - name: targetOffset
        type: number
        default:
        summary: |
          Offset from the beginning of the buffer memory, starting from `0`.

          Buffer to take the data from.
      - name: sourceOffset
        type: number?

        summary: |
          Offset from the beginning of the buffer memory, starting from `0`.
      - name: count
        type: number?
        default:
        summary: |
          Number of bytes to copy. If omitted, the whole `source` data starting
          from `sourceOffset` is taken.
