  A library of buffer functions.
description: |
  A buffer is an object that represents a fixed-size mutable block of memory.
  The buffer library provides functions for creation and manipulation of buffer
  objects, providing all its functions inside the global `Library.buffer`
  variable.

  Buffer is intended to be used a low-level binary data storage structure,
  replacing the uses of `Library.string.pack()` and `Library.string.unpack()`.
  Use cases include reading and writing existing binary formats, working with
  data in a more compact form, serialization to custom binary formats, and
  general work with native memory types like fixed-length integers and floats.

  When passed through Roblox APIs, including sending a buffer through custom
  events, the identity of the buffer object is not preserved and the target will
  receive a copy. Similar to other limitations, the same buffer object cannot be
  used from multiple `Class.Actor` scripts (Parallel Luau).

  Many of the functions accept an offset in bytes from the start of the buffer.
  Offset of 0 from the start of the buffer memory block accesses the first byte.
  All offsets, counts and sizes should be non-negative integer numbers. If the
  bytes that are accessed by any read or write operation are outside the buffer
  memory, an error is thrown.

  The `read` and `write` methods that work with integers and floats use
  [little-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) encoding.

      Creates a buffer.
    description: |
      Creates a buffer of the requested size with all bytes initialized to 0.
      Size limit is 1 GB, or 1,073,741,824 bytes. Keep in mind that larger
      buffers might fail to allocate if device is running low on memory.
