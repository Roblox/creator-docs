name: debug
type: library
summary: |
  This library provides functions useful for debugging and profiling code.
description: |
  Provides a few basic functions for debugging code in Roblox. Unlike the
  `Library.debug` library found in Lua natively, this version has been heavily
  sandboxed.

functions:
  - name: debug.traceback
    summary: |
      Returns a string of undefined format that describes the current function
      call stack.
    description: |
      Returns a traceback of the current function call stack as a string; in
      other words, a description of the functions that have been called up to
      this point. During debugging, this behaves like an error stack trace but
      does not stop execution of the script.

      The `level` parameter specifies what level of the call stack to consider,
      with `1` being the call of `Library.debug.traceback()` itself, `2` being
      the call of the function calling `Library.debug.traceback()`, and so on.
      See the code sample below for an example of sequential function calls.

      Note that this function will often return inaccurate results (compared to
      the original source code) and that the format of the returned traceback
      may change at any time. You should **not** parse the return value for
      specific information such as script names or line numbers.

      The following example includes sequential function calls; `fnB()` is
      called, and it calls `fnA()` which then calls `Library.debug.traceback()`.

      ```lua
      local function fnA()
      	print(debug.traceback("Specific moment during fnA()"))
      end

      local function fnB()
      	fnA()
      end

      -- Call function fnB() to begin traceback
      fnB()
      ```
    parameters:
      - name: message
        type: string
        default: ''
        summary: |
          The first line of the returned string.
      - name: level
        type: number
        default: 1
        summary: |
          The number of calls "up" the call stack to return.
    returns:
      - type: string
        summary: |
          Traceback of the current function call stack.

      Traverses the entire stack of current thread and returns a string
      containing the call stack of target level details.
    description: |
      Allows programmatic inspection of the call stack. This function differs
      from `Library.debug.traceback()` in that it guarantees the format of the
      data it returns. This is useful for general logging and filtering purposes
      as well as for sending the data to systems expecting structured input,
      such as crash aggregation.

      ```lua
      local function fnA()
      	-- Output source identifier ("s") and line ("l") at levels 1 and 2
      	print(debug.info(1, "sl"))  --> fnA() 3
      	print(debug.info(2, "sl"))  --> fnA() 7
      end

      fnA()
      ```

      Note that this function is similar to
      [debug.getinfo](https://www.lua.org/pil/23.1.html), an unavailable part of
      the standard Lua library which serves a similar purpose.

          should describe. A value of `1` represents the function which is
          calling `Library.debug.info()`, a value of `2` represents the function
          that called that function, and so on.
      - name: options
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          A string that describes what the returned information should
          represent. It must only contain 0 or 1 instances of the characters
          `slnaf`, each representing a piece of information:

          - `s` ([string](/luau/strings.md)) — The function source identifier,
            equal to the full name of the script the function is defined in.
          - `l` ([number](/luau/numbers.md)) — The line number of the function
            call represented by `level`.
          - `n` ([string](/luau/strings.md)) — The name of the function; may be
            `nil` for anonymous functions and C functions without an assigned
            debug name.
          - `a` ([number](/luau/numbers.md), [boolean](/luau/booleans.md)) —
            Arity of the function, which refers to the parameter count and
            whether the function is variadic.
          - `f` ([function](/luau/functions.md)) — The function which was
            inspected.
