  This library provides functions useful for debugging and profiling code.

  Provides a few basic functions for debugging code in Roblox. Unlike the
  `Library.debug` library found in Lua natively, this version has been heavily
  sandboxed. Roblox does, however, have debugging functionality similar to Lua's
  native debugging functionality (see the `Class.DebuggerManager` class).

functions:
  - name: debug.traceback
    summary: |
      Returns a string of undefined format that describes the current function
      call stack.
    description: |
      Returns a traceback of the current function call stack as a string; in
      other words, a description of the functions that have been called up to
      this point. During debugging, this behaves like an error stack trace but
      does not stop execution of the script.

      The `level` parameter specifies what level of the call stack to consider,
      with `1` being the call of `Library.debug.traceback()` itself, `2` being
      the call of the function calling `Library.debug.traceback()`, and so on.
      See the code sample below for an example of sequential function calls.

      The format of the returned traceback is **not defined** and may change at
      any time; use only for debug diagnostics and error analytics. It's
      recommended that you **never** parse the return value of this function for
      specific information, such as script names or line numbers.
    parameters:
      - name: message
        type: string
        default: ''
        summary: |
          The first line of the returned string.
      - name: level
        type: number
        default: 1
        summary: |
          The number of calls "up" the call stack to return.
    returns:

    summary: |
      Traverses the entire stack of target thread and returns a string
      containing the call stack of target level details.
    description: |
      Allows programmatic inspection of the call stack.

      - `thread` (thread) - A thread as returned by
        `Library.coroutine.create()`.
      - `level` - A `number` to describe the point at which information from the
        call stack information should be returned.
        - A value of `1` represents the function which is calling
          `Library.debug.info()`.
        - A value of `2` represents the function that called that function, and
          so on. Out-of-bounds values result in no values returned.
      - `options` - A string that represents the information to be returned. It
        must contain exactly 0 or 1 of each of the following characters and no
        others: `slnaf`
        - `s` - `Library.string`. The function source identifier, equal to the
          full name of the script the function is defined in
        - `l` - `number`. If `functionOrLevel` is a function, the line the
          function is defined on. If `functionOrLevel` is a number (examining a
          stack frame), the line number of the function call
        - `n` - `Library.string`. The name of the function, may be nil for
          anonymous functions and C functions without an assigned debug name.
        - `a` - `number`, `boolean`. Arity of the function, which refers to the
          parameter count and whether the function is variadic.
        - `f` - `function`. The function which was inspected.

      This function differs from `Library.debug.traceback()` in that it
      guarantees the format of the data it returns. This is useful not only for
      general logging and filtering purposes, but also for sending the data to
      systems expecting structured input, such as crash aggregation.

      This function is similar to
      [debug.getinfo](https://www.lua.org/pil/23.1.html), an unavailable part of
      the standard Lua library which serves a similar purpose.
    parameters:
      - name: thread
        type: thread
        default:
        summary: |
          A thread as returned by `Library.coroutine.create()`, omit entirely to
          use the current thread.
      - name: level
        type: number
        default:
        summary: |
          Determines at what level of the call stack the information returned
          should describe.
      - name: options
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          A string that describes what the returned information should
          represent. It must only contain 0 or 1 instances of the following
          characters, each representing a piece of information: `slnaf`.
