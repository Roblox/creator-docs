description: |
  Terrain lets you create dynamically morphable environments with little to no
  lag. It is currently based on a 4&times;4&times;4 grid of cells, where each
  cell has a number between 0 and 1 representing how much the geometry should
  occupy the cell, and the material of the cell. The occupancy determines how
  the cell will morph together with surrounding cells, and the result is the
  illusion of having no grid constraint.

  For more information, see [Terrain](../../../parts/terrain.md).

        summary: |
          Array of channel IDs (strings) that need to be accessed from the voxel
          data. Each channel ID represents a type of data that's stored in
          voxel. Current supported IDs are
          `{"SolidMaterial", "SolidOccupancy", "LiquidOccupancy"}`.
    returns:
      - type: Dictionary
        summary: |
          Returns voxel data as a dictionary based on the `channelIds` input.
          Keys represent each channel ID with their respective value as an array
          of 3D data.

          - `SolidMaterial` — The `Enum.Material` material of the voxel. Note
            that `Enum.Material|Water` is not supported anymore; instead, a
            voxel that contains water will have a value of `LiquidOccupancy`.
          - `SolidOccupancy` — The occupancy of the voxel's material as
            specified in the `SolidMaterial` channel. This is a value between 0
            (empty) and 1 (full).
          - `LiquidOccupancy` — Specifies the occupancy of the
            `Enum.Material|Water` material in a voxel as a value between 0 (no
            water) and 1 (full of water). If the `SolidOccupancy` is 1 and the
            `SolidMaterial` is not `Enum.Material|Air`, this will be 0.

          The dictionary also contains a `Size` key with a value representing
          the 3D array size of each channel data.

    description: |
      ReplaceMaterial replaces terrain of a certain `Enum.Material` within a
      `Datatype.Region3` with another material. Essentially, it is a
      find-and-replace operation on `Class.Terrain` materials.

      #### Constraints

      When calling this method, the `resolution` parameter must be exactly 4.
      Additionally, the Region3 must be aligned to the terrain materials grid,
      i.e. the components of the Region3's minimum and maximum points must be
      divisible by 4. Use `Datatype.Region3:ExpandToGrid()` to make a region
      compatible with this function.
