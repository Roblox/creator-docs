summary: |
  A service which provides control over screenshot and video capture features.
description: |
  `CaptureService` is a client-side service that allows developers to control
  how the screenshot and video capture feature integrates with their
  experiences. It can be used to include preset moments where a capture is
  automatically taken for a user, and that user can then save, share, or delete
  the capture.

    summary: |
      Takes a screenshot and provides a temporary `contentId` to identify it.
    description: |
      This method captures a screenshot for the user but does not immediately
      save it to their **Captures** gallery within the experience's main menu.
      Instead, a temporary `contentId` is created to identify the new capture.

      The `onCaptureReady` callback can be used to prompt the user to save or
      share the screenshot:

      ```lua
      local CaptureService = game:GetService("CaptureService")

      -- Reference to an ImageLabel parent of the script containing this code
      local imageLabel = script.Parent

      local function onCaptureReady(contentId)
      	imageLabel.Image = contentId
      end

      CaptureService:CaptureScreenshot(onCaptureReady)
      ```

      Prompts the user to share a specified capture.
    description: |
      This method prompts the user to share the capture identified by the
      provided `contentId` using the native share sheet on their device.

      The capture is shared along with an invite link to the experience when
      supported. Not all devices support including both a screenshot or video
      and an invite link.

      The `launchData` will be available in the `launchData` field for users who
      join through the invite link.

      For users or devices who are not eligible to use share sheets, this method
      prompts them to download the capture instead.

      Initiates a video capture recording.

      This method initiates a video capture recording. The recording will
      continue until the
      `Class.CaptureService:StopVideoCapture()|StopVideoCapture()` method is
      called, or when 30 seconds have passed, whichever comes first. During the
      video recording, all user voices are muted.

      The `onCaptureReady` callback can be used to prompt the user to save or
      share the video capture.

      ```lua
      local CaptureService = game:GetService("CaptureService")

      local parent = script.Parent

      local onCaptureReady = function(result, videoCapture)
      	if result ~= Enum.VideoCaptureResult.Success and result ~= Enum.VideoCaptureResult.TimeLimitReached or not videoCapture then

      This client-side function prompts a user for permission to access their
      local captures. Once they have accepted or rejected the prompt, it returns
      a boolean representing their choice. This function is a necessary
      prerequisite to `ReadCapturesFromGalleryAsync` and `UploadCaptureAsync`,
      as both of these require gallery permissions to work.

    returns:
      - type: boolean

    description: |
      This client-side function returns a paginated list of captures from the
      user's gallery as a `Class.CapturesPages` object, which can be used to
      iterate through the captures. The results can be filtered by capture type
      with the `captureTypeFilters` parameter. If this parameter isn't provided,
      the function returns all captures.

      Note: At the moment, this function will only return captures taken the
      experience where it is called.

      This client-side function uploads a capture, like one retrieved from
      `ReadCapturesFromGalleryAsync`, to the asset system. It returns a tuple of
      the result and the asset ID.

      Notes:

      - This function will only work properly if the Maturity and Compliance
        questionnaire has been filled out for the experience.
      - For video capture types, there is an upload limit of 20 videos per day
        per user.
      - This function can take up to several minutes to finish executing, and
        the user will need to remain in the experience.
