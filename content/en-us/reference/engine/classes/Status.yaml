deprecation_message: |
  Status is an unfinished object designed to store custom `Class.Humanoid`
  statuses. It has been deprecated and should not be used by developers in new
  work.

  Developers looking to implement custom `Class.Humanoid` statuses should use
  [Character Physics Controllers](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/releasing-character-physics-controllers/2623426),
  as they are written in Luau and are easily extendable.
