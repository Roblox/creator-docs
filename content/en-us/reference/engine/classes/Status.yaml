deprecation_message: |
  Status is an unfinished object designed to store custom `Class.Humanoid`
  statuses. It has been depreciated and should not be used by developers in new
  work.

  Developers looking to implement custom `Class.Humanoid` statuses should use
  `Class.CollectionService` which provides a more flexible and robust system for
  tagging objects.
