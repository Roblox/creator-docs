summary: |
  Base class for objects that continually exert forces to assemblies.
description: |
  `BodyMover` is the abstract base class for the set of legacy objects that
  exert forces to assemblies in different ways. In general, the subclasses of
  `BodyMover` are:

  - `Class.BodyForce` exerts a force relative to world coordinates.
  - `Class.BodyPosition` exerts force to maintain a certain world position.
  - `Class.BodyVelocity` exerts force to maintain a certain velocity.
  - `Class.BodyThrust` exerts a force relative to object coordinates which
    applies torque if positioned in a certain way.
  - `Class.BodyGyro` exerts torque to maintain a certain orientation.
  - `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` exerts torque to maintain a certain angular
    velocity.
  - `Class.RocketPropulsion` exerts both translational and rotational forces to
    cause an assembly to track down another.
