summary: |
  Base class for objects that continually exert forces to parts.
description: |
  BodyMover is the abstract base class for the set of legacy objects that exert
  forces to `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` in different ways. In general, the
  subclasses of BodyMover can be placed into one of two categories based on the
  type of force(s) they exert:

  ## Translational Force

  - `Class.BodyForce`: Exert a force relative to world coordinates
  - `Class.BodyPosition`: Exert force to maintain a certain world position
  - `Class.BodyVelocity`: Exert force to maintain a certain velocity

  ## Rotational Force (Torque)

  - `Class.BodyThrust`: Exert a force relative to object coordinates, which
    applies torque if positioned in a certain way
  - `Class.BodyGyro`: Exert torque to maintain a certain orientation
  - `Class.BodyAngularVelocity`: Exert torque to maintain a certain angular
    velocity

  An exception is the `Class.RocketPropulsion` class, which exerts **both**
  translational and rotational forces to cause a part to track down another
  part.
