  Adjusts the dynamic range of audio.
description: |
  A `Class.CompressorSoundEffect` is used to reduce the dynamic range of audio
  by moving the highs and lows of a signal closer together. It does this by
  lowering the volume of the highest parts of a source while at the same time
  raising the overall volume. This type of effect is useful when you have many
  sounds playing and you want to make sure the quieter ones are still audible.
  This effect can be applied to either an individual `Class.Sound` or
  `Class.SoundGroup` by parenting it to the desired instance.

  A compressor has several properties which determine how it works. The
  `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Threshold|Threshold` is the audio level where the
  compressor will start to lower the volume. As soon as the source goes below
  the threshold, the compressor will stop lowering the volume.

  The `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Attack|Attack` determines how long it takes
  for the compressed effect to fully apply. After the threshold has been crossed
  the compressor will lower the volume over time until the desired ratio has
  been reached. It will take the time specified by
  `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Attack|Attack` to reach this ratio.

  The `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Release|Release` determines how long it takes
  for the compressor to remove its effect. After the volume of the source is
  under the threshold, the compressor will restore the volume back to the
  original over the time specified by
  `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Release|Release`.

  Along with lowering the volume when the sound has passed the threshold, a
  compressor will also amplify the entire sound (after any threshold lowering
  has taken effect). This allows quieter sounds to be amplified while louder
  sounds can stay about the same. The
  `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.GainMakeup|GainMakeup` determines how much the
  effect amplifies the sound.

      The overall amplification applied to the effect's `Class.Sound` or
