  Adjusts the dynamic range of audio.
description: |
  A compressor is used to reduce the dynamic range of audio by moving the highs
  and lows of a signal closer together. It does this by lowering the volume of
  the highest parts of a source while at the same time raising the overall
  volume. This type of effect is useful when you have many sounds playing and
  you want to make sure the quieter ones are still audible. This effect can be
  applied to either an individual `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by
  parenting it to the desired instance.

  A compressor has several properties which determine how it works. The
  `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Threshold` is the audio level where the
  compressor will start to lower the volume. As soon as the source goes below
  the threshold, the compressor will stop lowering the volume.

  The `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Attack` determines how long it takes for the
  compressed effect to fully apply. After the threshold has been crossed the
  compressor will lower the volume over time until the desired ratio has been
  reached. It will take the time specified by Attack to reach this ratio.

  The `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.Release` determines how long it takes for the
  compressor to remove its effect. After the volume of the source is under the
  threshold, the compressor will restore the volume back to the original over
  the time specified by Release.

  Along with lowering the volume when the sound has passed the threshold, a
  compressor will also amplify the entire sound (after any threshold lowering
  has taken effect). This allows quieter sounds to be amplified while louder
  sounds can stay about the same. The `Class.CompressorSoundEffect.GainMakeup`
  determines how much the effect amplifies the sound.
