  PluginGui is an abstract class for GUIs that allow the display of
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` in various Roblox Studio widgets. As of right
  now, the only available PluginGui type is `Class.DockWidgetPluginGui`, but
  there may be more in the future!

    summary: |
      Binds a function to the `Class.PluginGui` close button, overriding the
      default behavior.
    description: |
      This function binds a function to the `Class.PluginGui` close button,
      overriding the default behavior.

      By default, when the user clicks the 'x' button in the top right corner of
      the `Class.PluginGui` the `Class.LayerCollector.Enabled|Enabled` property
      is set to _false_, closing the window. When a custom function is bound
      using BindToClose this behavior is overwritten, allowing you to check if
      the user really wants to close the window or give them an opportunity to
      save their work.

      As the default closing behavior is overwritten by this function, you'll
      need to configure the `Class.PluginGui` to close manually by setting
      `Class.LayerCollector.Enabled|PluginGui.Enabled` to _false_. For example,
      in the below snippet users are required to click a confirm button to close
      the GUI:

      ```lua
      local closing = false
      pluginGui:BindToClose(function()
      	-- make sure we haven't already made a button
      	if closing then
      		return
      	end
      	closing = true

      	-- create confirm button
      	local confirmButton = Instance.new("TextButton")
      	confirmButton.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5)
      	confirmButton.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
      	confirmButton.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
      	confirmButton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 0, 0)
      	confirmButton.Text = "Close?"
      	confirmButton.Parent = pluginGui

      	-- listen for click
      	confirmButton.Activated:Connect(function()
      		-- close the gui
      		pluginGui.Enabled = false

      		-- remove confirm button
      		confirmButton:Destroy()
      	end)
      end)
      ```

      You can call BindToClose with no argument to 'unbind' and revert to the
      default behavior described above. For example:

      ```lua
      pluginGui:BindToClose()
      ```

        the game ending and should not be confused with this function

    description: |
      GetRelativeMousePosition returns the position of the mouse relative to the
      top-left corner of the `Class.PluginGui`. The returned value changes only
      if a mouse input began on the PluginGui, or if the mouse is presently
      hovering over the window.

      Fires when the user releases their mouse when hovering over a PluginGui

    description: |
      **PluginDragDropped** fires when the user releases their mouse over a
      `Class.PluginGui` during a drag operation started by
      `Class.Plugin:StartDrag()`.

      Fires when the user's mouse enters a PluginGui during a drag operation

    description: |
      **PluginDragEntered** fires when the user's mouse enters the
      `Class.PluginGui` during a drag operation started by
      `Class.Plugin:StartDrag()`.

      This event is useful for displaying a "Drop Here" UI on PluginGuis where a
      drag operation can be dropped. Such a UI should be hidden when either
      `Class.PluginGui.PluginDragLeft|PluginDragLeft` or
      `Class.PluginGui.PluginDragDropped|PluginDragDropped` fire.

      **PluginDragLeft** fires when the user's mouse leaves a `Class.PluginGui`
      during a drag operation started by `Class.Plugin:StartDrag()`.

      This event and `Class.PluginGui.PluginDragDropped|PluginDragDropped` are
      useful for hiding a "Drop Here" UI on PluginGuis where a drag operation
      can be dropped. Such a UI should be shown when either
      `Class.PluginGui.PluginDragEntered|PluginDragEntered` fires.

    summary: |
      Fires when the user begins interacting with the window of the PluginGui.
    description: |
      **WindowFocused** fires immediately when the user starts interacting with
      the PluginGui's window, usually by clicking on it. This functions works
      similarly to the similarly-named `Class.UserInputService.WindowFocused`
      event. It fires before any `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan` events related to
      mouse buttons.

      If another `Class.PluginGui` is in focus and the user focuses this
      PluginGui, then this event fires after the other's
      `Class.PluginGui.WindowFocusReleased|WindowFocusReleased` event. However,
      if the main game window was in focus, this event fires **after**
      `Class.UserInputService.WindowFocusReleased`.

    description: |
      **WindowFocusReleased** fires immediately when the user stops interacting
      with the PluginGui's window, usually by clicking on something not in the
      window. This functions works similarly to the similarly-named
      `Class.UserInputService.WindowFocusReleased` event.

      If focus is moving to another `Class.PluginGui` while the user had this
      PluginGui in focus, then this event fires before the other's
      `Class.PluginGui.WindowFocused|WindowFocused` event. However, if the main
      game window is being put in focus, this event fires **after**
      `Class.UserInputService.WindowFocused`.
