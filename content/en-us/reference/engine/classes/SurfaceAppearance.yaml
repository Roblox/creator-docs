  SurfaceAppearance objects allow developers to override the appearance of a
  `Class.MeshPart` with advanced graphics options. Most notably, a
  SurfaceAppearance can apply a set of PBR textures to a mesh.

  PBR is short for Physically Based Rendering, which refers to a common texture
  format for defining extra physical details in games. Because this format is
  widely used, it's easy to take meshes and textures made in 3rd party editing
  software and import them into Roblox. It's also easy to find PBR format
  content from various 3rd party stores such as
  [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/search?q=pbr%20object&sort_by=-relevance&type=models),
  [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/pbr),
  [CGTrader](http://cgtrader.com/pbr-3d-models?polygons=lt_5k).

  For PBR textures to be visible in-game, when you change a texture property of
  SurfaceAppearance you should wait until you see the "Successfully uploaded
  compressed SurfaceAppearance." message in the output window. If your PBR
  textures are not visible, try changing a texture property.

  Here is a mesh with PBR textures
  [found on Turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-model-fantasy-sword---ready/1119210)
  imported into Roblox.

  SurfaceAppearance's `Class.SurfaceAppearance.AlphaMode|AlphaMode` property can
  also be to improve the look of partially transparent textures on MeshParts by
  fixing various sorting issues.

  How a MeshPart with a SurfaceAppearance looks to users depends on their device
  and their graphics quality level. You may want to preview your content with
  different quality level settings.

  Note:

  - Most SurfaceAppearance properties cannot be modified by scripts in-game.
    This is because the Roblox engine needs to do some pre-processing to display
    a SurfaceAppearance, and this is usually too expensive to perform in-game.

      This property determines how the alpha channel of the
      `Class.SurfaceAppearance.ColorMap` of a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` is used.

      When AlphaMode is set to `Enum.AlphaMode|Transparency` and the
      `Class.BasePart.Transparency|MeshPart.Transparency` is set to 0, opaque
      pixels in the SurfaceAppearance's ColorMap will render as completely
      opaque in the 3D scene. This solves various problems for textures with
      different transparent and opaque areas, such as foliage. When parts of the
      surface are fully opaque, the Roblox engine can render them with proper
      depth-based occlusion. Opaque surfaces also generally work better with
      depth-based effects like `Class.DepthOfFieldEffect`, glass and water
      refraction, and water reflection.

    description: |
      This property determines the color and opacity of the surface. This
      texture is sometimes called the albedo texture. The alpha channel of this
      texture controls its opacity, which behaves differently based on the
      `Class.SurfaceAppearance.AlphaMode` setting.

      Determines which parts of the surface are metal and are non-metal.
    description: |
      This property determines which parts of the surface are metal and are
      non-metal. A metalness map is a grayscale image where black pixels
      correspond to non-metals and white pixels correspond to metals.

      Metals only reflect light the same color as the metal, and they reflect
      much more light than non-metals. Most materials in the real world can be
      categorized either metals or non-metals. For this reason, most pixels in a
      metalness map will be either pure black or pure white. Values in between
      are typically used to simulate dirt or grunge on top of an underlying
      metal area.

      When `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` is 0, metalness has no
      effect. For the most realistic reflections, setting
      EnvironmentSpecularScale and `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` to
      1, and `Class.Lighting.Ambient` and `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient` to
      (0,0,0) is recommended.

      This property modifies the lighting of the surface by adding bumps, dents,
      cracks, and curves without adding more polygons.

      Normal maps are RGB images that modify the surface's normal vector used
      for lighting calculations. The R, G, and B channels of the NormalMap
      correspond to the X, Y, and Z components of the local surface vector
      respectively, and byte values of 0 and 255 for each channel correspond
      linearly to normal vector components of -1 and 1.016 respectively. This
      range is stretched slightly from -1 to 1 so that a byte value of 127 maps
      to exactly 0. The normal vector's Z axis is always defined as the
      direction of the underlying mesh's normal. A uniform (127,127,255) image
      translates to a completely flat normal map where the normal is everywhere
      perpendicular to the mesh surface. This format is called "tangent space"
      normal maps. Roblox does not support world space or object space normal
      maps.

      Incorrectly flipped normal components can make bumps appear like indents.
      If you import a normal map and notice the lighting looks off, you may need
      to invert the G channel of the image. The X and Y axes of the tangent
      space frame correspond to the X and Y directions in the image after it's
      transformed by the mesh UVs. If you view your normal map in an image
      editor as if it were displayed on a surface, normals pointing towards the
      right side of the screen should appear more red, and normals pointing
      towards the top side of your screen should appear more green.

      The terms "DirectX format" and "OpenGL format" are sometimes used to
      describe whether the G channel of the normal map is inverted or not.
      Roblox expects the OpenGL format.

      Roblox expects imported meshes to include tangents. Modeling software may
      also refer to this as "tangent space" information. If you apply a normal
      map and it does not seem to make any visual difference, you may need to
      re-export your mesh along with its tangent information from modeling
      software.

      Determines the apparent roughness across the surface.
    description: |
      This property determines the apparent roughness across the surface. A
      roughness map is a grayscale image where black pixels correspond to a
      maximally smooth surface, and white pixels correspond to a maximally rough
      surface.

      Roughness refers to how much variation the surface has on a very small
      scale. Reflections on smooth surfaces are sharp and concentrated.
      Reflections on rough surfaces are more blurry and dispersed.
