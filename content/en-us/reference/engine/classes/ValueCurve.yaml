name: ValueCurve
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A sorted list of time-value pairs that define a curve. Used to animate a any
  type of value.
description: |
  An instance representing a 1D value curve encoded via a sorted list of
  `Datatype.ValueCurveKey|ValueCurveKeys`. The shape of the interpolation curve
  between two keys is determined by the `Datatype.ValueCurveKey.Interpolation`
  type.

  Not all value types (for example, strings and other non-numerical types) may
  perform `Enum.KeyInterpolationMode.Linear|Linear` or
  `Enum.KeyInterpolationMode.Cubic|Cubic` interpolation. These types will revert
  to `Enum.KeyInterpolationMode.Constant|Constant` interpolation if necessary.

      Resets this curve's keys using the `Datatype.ValueCurveKey` array passed

      order before insertion, and keys at duplicated times are removed in a
      stable manner.

      Returns the number of keys actually inserted. Keys previously stored in
      this curve are removed before the keys passed as arguments are added.

      The keys must all contain values of the same type. And that type must
      match any existing keys. Otherwise a message is printed, the keys are not
      added, and `0` is returned.
