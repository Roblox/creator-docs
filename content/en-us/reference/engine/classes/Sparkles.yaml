summary: |
  A particle emitter with the visual aesthetic of sparkles.
description: |
  Sparkles is one of several particle-emitting classes. Like other particle
  emitters of its kind, Sparkles objects emit particles when parented to a
  `Class.BasePart` (such as a `Class.Part`) or an `Class.Attachment` within such
  a `Class.BasePart`. Compared to the `Class.ParticleEmitter` class, Sparkles
  lacks many different customization properties and special methods, such as
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` or `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()`. It is
  useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it
  is preferable to use a `Class.ParticleEmitter` instead.

  When `Class.Sparkles.Enabled` is toggled off, particles emit by this object
  will continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Sparkles object's
  `Class.Instance.Parent` is set to `nil` (and/or `Class.Instance:Destroy()`ed),
  all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try
  hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Sparkles
  after a few seconds using `Class.Debris` to give the last particles a chance
  to expire. This object does not have a `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()` method,
  but it is possible to set the `Class.Instance.Parent` to `nil` and back to the
  exact same object for the same effect.

  Sparkles particles are only emitted from the center of `Class.BasePart` to
  which they are parented. Parenting a Sparkles object to an `Class.Attachment`
  instead allows customization of the particles' start position.

properties:
  - name: Sparkles.Color
    summary: |
      Determines the color of the sparkle particles.
    description: |
      The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a
      `Class.Sparkles` object (both existing and future particles). It behaves
      similarly to `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color`, except that it is only one
      color and not a `Datatype.ColorSequence`. Sparkles have a natural color
      sequence applied which is most apparent when this property is set to
      white; sparkles very faintly animate between a subtle green and red.

      It should be noted that sparkles have a partial
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightEmission` effect, so dark colors tend to
      render more transparent and white colors look very bright.

    summary: |
      Determines whether sparkles are emit.
    description: |
      The Enabled property, much like `Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled`,
      determines whether sparkle particles are emit. Any particles already emit
      will continue to render until their lifetime expires. This property is
      useful for keeping pre-made sparkle effects off until they are needed
      later. Since sparkle particles are destroyed when the `Sparkle` object's
      `Class.Instance.Parent` is set to `nil`, this property is useful in
      allowing existing particles the opportunity to expire before destroying
      the Fire object altogether. See the function below.

      ```
      local Debris = game:GetService("Debris")
      local part = script.Parent
      function stopSparkling(sparkles)
      	sparkles.Enabled = false -- No more new particles
      	Debris:AddItem(sparkles, 4) -- Remove the object after a delay (after existing particles have expired)
      end
      stopSparkling(part.Sparkles)
      ```

      Determines the color of the sparkle particles.
    description: |
      This property functions identically to `Class.Sparkles.Color`.

      The SparkleColor property determines the color of all the particles emit
      by a `Class.Sparkles` object (both existing and future particles). It
      behaves similarly to `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color`, except that it is only
      one color and not a `Datatype.ColorSequence`. Sparkles have a natural
      color sequence applied which is most apparent when this property is set to
      white; sparkles very faintly animate between a subtle green and red.

      It should be noted that sparkles have a partial
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightEmission` effect, so dark colors tend to
      render more transparent and white colors look very bright.
