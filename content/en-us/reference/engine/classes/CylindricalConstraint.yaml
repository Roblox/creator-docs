memory_category: PhysicsParts
summary: |
  Constrains two attachments on two parts to have a relative linear and
  rotational motion.
description: |
  A **CylindricalConstraint** allows its attachments to slide along one axis and
  rotate about another axis. It can be thought of like a combination of a
  `Class.PrismaticConstraint` and a `Class.HingeConstraint`. The sliding axis is
  determined by the **X** axis of the constraint's
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. The rotation axis is centered at
  the constraint's `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` and is angled off
  of the sliding constraint by the constraint's
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle|InclinationAngle`.

  This constraint, along with a `Class.SpringConstraint`, is ideal for building
  vehicle suspension.

  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**)
  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not
  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Angular Power

  If a cylindrical's
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType` is set
  to `Enum.ActuatorType|Motor`, it attempts to rotate the attachments with the
  goal of reaching its
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity`. You can further
  control this rotation through both
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxAngularAcceleration|MotorMaxAngularAcceleration`
  and `Class.CylindricalConstraint.MotorMaxTorque|MotorMaxTorque`. If a
  cylindrical's
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularActuatorType|AngularActuatorType` is set
  to `Enum.ActuatorType|Servo`, it attempts to rotate to an angle specified by
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.TargetAngle|TargetAngle`. This rotation is
  controlled by `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularSpeed|AngularSpeed`,
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularResponsiveness|AngularResponsiveness`, and
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.ServoMaxTorque|ServoMaxTorque`.

  #### Linear Power

  If a cylindrical's `Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorType|Motor`, it attempts to translate the attachments with the
  goal of reaching `Class.CylindricalConstraint|Velocity`. You can further
  control this translation through both
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxAcceleration` and
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|MotorMaxForce`. If a cylindrical's
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|ActuatorType` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorType|Servo`, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set
  separation specified by `Class.CylindricalConstraint|TargetPosition`. This
  translation is controlled by `Class.CylindricalConstraint|Speed`,
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|LinearResponsiveness`, and
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|ServoMaxForce`.

  #### Limits

  You can set limits to restrict both the **sliding range** and **rotation** of
  a cylindrical constraint. Enabling the
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|LimitsEnabled` property exposes the
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|LowerLimit` and
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|UpperLimit` values, as well as
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint|Restitution` which defines the elasticity of the
  attachments when they reach either limit. Enabling the
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularLimitsEnabled|AngularLimitsEnabled`
  property exposes the `Class.CylindricalConstraint.LowerAngle|LowerAngle` and
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.UpperAngle|UpperAngle` limits, as well as
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.AngularRestitution|AngularRestitution` which
  defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach either limit.

  #### Inclination Angle

  `Class.CylindricalConstraint.InclinationAngle|InclinationAngle` defines the
  direction of the rotation axis as an angle from the **X** axis in the **XY**
  plane of `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`, from
  -180&nbsp;to&nbsp;180. This lets you tilt the rotating element without
  changing the sliding axis.
