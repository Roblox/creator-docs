    summary: |
      The maximum torque the character can use to remain balanced upright.
    description: |
      The maximum torque the character can use to remain balanced upright. When
      misaligned, this amount of torque is applied to reach the
      `Class.AirController.BalanceSpeed|BalanceSpeed` and realign the character.
      A higher torque means more force is required to cause the character to
      tilt. A lower torque means it's easer for the character to flip in the
      air. This property is hidden and has no effect when
      `Class.ControllerBase.BalanceRigidityEnabled` is true.

    description: |
      The maximum angular speed used to align the character upright. A lower
      value means it takes longer for the character to recover to the upright
      position when misaligned. A higher value results in a quicker recovery.
