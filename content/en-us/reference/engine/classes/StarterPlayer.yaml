  A service which allows the defaults of properties in the `Class.Player` object
  to be set. When a player enters the server, each property of the player object
  is set to the current value of the corresponding property in
  `Class.StarterPlayer`.

  Additionally, you may add four objects to this service:

  - A `Class.StarterPlayerScripts` instance with scripts that run once for each
    player.
  - A `Class.StarterCharacterScripts` instance with scripts to add to each
    player's character every time they spawn.
  - A `Class.Humanoid` instance named `StarterHumanoid` which will be used as
    the default humanoid for each player's character.
  - A `Class.Model` instance named `StarterCharacter` which will be used as the
    character model for all players.

      This property sets whether the character will automatically jump when
      hitting an obstacle on a mobile device.

      This property is copied from the `Class.StarterPlayer` to a `Class.Player`
      when they join the game. Following that. the value of this property is
      copied to `Class.Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled` property of the character's
      `Class.Humanoid` on spawn. In other words, it is possible to set the
      auto-jump behavior on a per-character, per-player and per-game basis using
      these three properties.

      This property controls the rollout state of new

      spawn with legacy `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` connecting their limbs. When
      enabled, avatars spawn with
      `Class.AnimationConstraint|AnimationConstraints` and
      `Class.BallSocketConstraint|BallSocketConstraints` connecting their limbs.
      This makes it easier to write scripts that enable physical simulation,
      like arm strength and ragdoll falling down.

      Sets the default value for `Class.Player.CameraMode` for each player in
      the game. The camera has two modes:

      #### First Person

      In first person mode, the player's camera is zoomed all the way in. Unless
      there is a visible GUI present with the `Class.GuiButton.Modal` property
      set to `true`, the mouse will be locked and the user's camera will turn as
      the mouse moves.

      #### Third Person

      In third person mode (default), the character can be seen in the camera.
      While in third person mode on Roblox:

      - You may right-click and drag to rotate your camera, or use the arrow
        keys at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
      - When you move your mouse, your camera does not change (unless you move
        the mouse to the end of the screen).
      - When you press any of the arrow keys, the user's character will face in
        the corresponding arrow key's direction.
      - You can zoom in and out freely.

      Sets the distance at which this player will see other `Class.Humanoid`
      names. If set to `0`, names are hidden. This property is set to `100`
      studs by default.

      To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you
      can set the `Class.Player.NameDisplayDistance` property.

      If a `Class.Humanoid` name is visible, you can set the display type using
      `Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType`.

    description: |
      This property determines if user-owned emotes are loaded when loading
      avatars. Setting this property to `false` disables loading. Developers can
      set the property in Studio directly.

      When emote loading is disabled, the emotes UI will still work as long as
      developers choose to use the emotes feature by adding emotes within their
      game.

      See also [Avatar Emotes](../../../characters/emotes.md), an article
      detailing how to control, customize, and play avatar emotes.
