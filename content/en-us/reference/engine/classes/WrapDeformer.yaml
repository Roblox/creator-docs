summary: |
  Allows for the real-time deformation of a `Class.MeshPart`.
description: |
  The `Class.WrapDeformer` object provides a low-resolution cage mesh that pairs
  with a `Class.WrapTarget` sibling to deform a parent `Class.MeshPart`. The
  `Class.MeshPart` geometry is deformed according to the displacement between
  pairs of `Class.WrapTarget` cage mesh vertices and `Class.WrapDeformer` cage
  mesh vertices. Cage mesh vertices are paired based on UV equivalence.

  `Class.WrapDeformer` may be used with avatars or on distinct
  `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`, as long as `Class.WrapTarget` children are present
  for the parent `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`. `Class.WrapDeformer` is similar to
  `Class.WrapLayer` but doesn't require layered clothing and can directly deform
  `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts` for publishing.

    summary: |
      Sets the cage mesh used to deform against a sibling `Class.WrapTarget`
      cage mesh.
    description: |
      Sets the cage mesh used to deform the parent `Class.MeshPart` in
      conjunction with a sibling `Class.WrapTarget` cage mesh. The `content`
      parameter should represent a Roblox mesh asset ID or an
      `Class.EditableMesh` reference in your `Class.DataModel`.

    summary: |
      Returns an `Class.EditableMesh` (currently unskinned) equivalent to the
      deformed parent mesh.
    description: |
      Constructs and returns an `Class.EditableMesh` corresponding to the
      deformed parent mesh geometry. This method respects all updates made to
      the deformation inputs prior to the request. It also sets the returned
      result's `Class.EditableMesh.FixedSize|FixedSize` to `true`.

  - name: WrapDeformer:GetDeformedCFrameAsync
    summary: |
      Returns a `Datatype.CFrame` deformed comparably to the `Class.MeshPart`.
    description: |
      Returns a `Datatype.CFrame` deformed by the same deformation field used
      for the geometry of the parent `Class.MeshPart`. This method is useful for
      the placement of accessories.

      The input and output `Datatype.CFrame` are both in the space of the parent
      `Class.MeshPart`; only position (not rotation) will be deformed. This
      method respects all updates made to the deformation inputs prior to the
      request.
