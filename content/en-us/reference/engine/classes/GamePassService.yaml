      #### Legacy Game Passes

      Historically, game passes on Roblox had an _Asset ID_ associated with
      them. Although game passes created with an _Asset ID_ still have an _Asset
      ID_, they now also have a _Game Pass ID_. All new game passes created
      today **only** have a _Game Pass ID_.

      You can retrieve the _Game Pass ID_ of any pass through its URL, for
      example the _Game Pass ID_ of the below pass is 1:

      ```
      https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1/myGamePass
      ```

      Whether you are using an _Asset ID_ or a _Game Pass ID_ determines which
      API members you can use.

      <table >
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <td> </td>
                  <td>Works with Asset ID (Legacy)</td>
                  <td>Works with Game Pass ID (Current)</td>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td>Verify Ownership</td>
                  <td>`Class.GamePassService:PlayerHasPass()`</td>
                  <td>`Class.MarketplaceService:UserOwnsGamePassAsync()`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Prompt a purchase</td>
                  <td>`Class.MarketplaceService:PromptPurchase()`</td>
                  <td>`Class.MarketplaceService:PromptGamePassPurchase()`</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Prompted purchase finished</td>
                  <td>`Class.MarketplaceService.PromptPurchaseFinished`</td>
                  <td>`Class.MarketplaceService.PromptGamePassPurchaseFinished`</td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>

      API members that work with _Asset IDs_ **will not** work with new game
      passes as they do not have them.
    code_samples:
      - GamePassService-PlayerHasPass1
    parameters:
      - name: player
        type: Player
        default:
        summary: |
          The `Class.Player` for which to check ownership.
      - name: gamePassId
        type: int64
        default:
        summary: |
          The _Asset ID_ of the game pass. This is **not** the _Game Pass ID_
          (see above).
    returns:
      - type: bool
        summary: |
          Whether the `Class.Player` owns the game pass.
