      #### Legacy Game Passes

      Historically, game passes on Roblox had an **asset ID** associated with
      them. Although such game passes still have an asset ID, they now also have
      a **pass ID**. All new game passes created **only** have a pass ID.

      Whether you are using an **Asset ID** or a **pass ID** determines which
      API members you can use.
