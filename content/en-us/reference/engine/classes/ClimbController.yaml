      The amount of time taken to reach the desired climb velocity from 0.

      The amount of time taken to reach the desired climb velocity from 0. May
      be inaccurate depending on max force and gravity.

  - name: ClimbController.BalanceMaxTorque
    summary: |
      The maximum torque used to keep the `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart`
      aligned upright and aligned to the climbed surface.
    description: |
      The maximum torque used to keep the `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart`
      aligned upright and aligned to the
      `Class.ControllerManager.ClimbSensor.HitNormal`. When misaligned, this
      amount of torque is applied to reach the
      `Class.ClimbController.BalanceSpeed|BalanceSpeed` and realign the root
      part. A higher torque means more force is required to cause the root part
      to tilt. This property is hidden and has no effect when
      `Class.ControllerBase.BalanceRigidityEnabled` is true.

    summary: |
      The maximum angular speed used to align the
      `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart` upright and with the climbed surface.
    description: |
      The maximum angular speed used to align the
      `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart` upright and aligned to the
      `Class.ControllerManager.ClimbSensor.HitNormal`. A lower value means it
      takes longer for the root part to recover to the align position when
      misaligned. A higher value results in a quicker recovery.
