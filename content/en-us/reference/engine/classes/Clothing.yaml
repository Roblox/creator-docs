    description: |
      This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
      `Class.Clothing` texture. The default colorization value is
      `Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(1,1,1)` (white). When set to white no
      colorization occurs

      It functions similarly to `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3` and
      `Class.Decal.Color3` except that it is applied to Clothing textures.

      It is useful for creating outfits that have many different color
      variations, but share the same basic look, possibly for a character
      creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied
      NPCs.

      #### Examples

      - Outfits that fade to different colors over time
      - Outfits that have many different color variations, but share the same
        basic look
      - A targeting texture that changes from red to blue when you target a
        specific type of object

      The image below demonstrates the same shirt with two different
      colorizations. The first shirt has a red colorization and the second shirt
      has a blue colorization.
