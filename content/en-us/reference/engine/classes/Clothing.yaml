    description: |
      This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
      `Class.Clothing` texture. The default colorization value is
      `Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(1, 1, 1)` (white), at which no colorization
      occurs.

      This property is useful for creating outfits that have many different
      color variations but share the same basic look, possibly for a character
      creator in a roleplaying game or generating a lot of different varied
      NPCs.

      See also `Class.ShirtGraphic.Color3` which determines the colorization to
      be applied to the `Class.ShirtGraphic` texture.
