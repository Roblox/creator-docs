description: |
  A `Class.SensorBase` that outputs data about another `Class.BasePart` based on
  `Class.Humanoid` floor and ladder detection logic. It is primarily used for
  sending data to a character controller. Using a `Class.ControllerPartSensor`
  allows you to detect `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` in the same manner as the
  `Class.Humanoid` uses for detecting floors and ladders.

      A setting of `Enum.SensorMode.Ladder` performs the same ladder detection
      logic used by a `Class.Humanoid` to populate sensor output. It currently
      always senses along the forward vector of its parent `Class.BasePart`.

      A setting of `Enum.SensorMode.Floor` performs the same floor detection
      logic used by a `Class.Humanoid` to populate sensor output. It currently
      always senses along the negative up vector of the world.
