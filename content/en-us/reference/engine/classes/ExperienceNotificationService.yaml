methods:
  - name: ExperienceNotificationService:CanPromptOptInAsync
    summary: |
      Indicates whether the local player can be prompted to enable
      notifications.
    description: |
      `Class.ExperienceNotificationService:CanPromptOptInAsync()|CanPromptOptInAsync()`
      returns `true` if the local player can be prompted to enable
      notifications. You should always use the result of this method before
      calling `Class.ExperienceNotificationService:PromptOptIn()|PromptOptIn()`
      since the ability to be prompted depends on various factors like the
      player's age or whether they've already enabled notifications for your
      experience.

      This method always infers the **local** player
      (`Class.Players.LocalPlayer`) and it can only be called from a
      `Class.LocalScript` or from a `Class.Script` with
      `Class.BaseScript.RunContext|RunContext` set to
      `Enum.RunContext.Client|Client`. It should also be called in a
      `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall|pcall()` since it's an asynchronous network call
      that may occasionally fail.

      See
      [Experience notifications](../../../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md)
      for more details on implementing and customizing notifications, using
      launch data, and more.

      `Class.ExperienceNotificationService:PromptOptIn()|PromptOptIn()` prompts
      the local player to enable notifications through an in-experience modal.
      You should always use the result of

      This event fires when the local player closes a prompt that was displayed
      through `Class.ExperienceNotificationService:PromptOptIn()|PromptOptIn()`.
