  Adjusts the frequency content of audio streams.
description: |
  `Class.AudioEqualizer` adjusts the frequency content of audio streams. It
  provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be connected
  to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`. `Class.AudioEqualizer` has 3 frequency bands
  whose gain values can be controlled, and the crossover points between bands
  can be moved.

      The frequency range in hertz of the band influenced by
      `Class.AudioEqualizer.MidGain|MidGain`. The lower value of the range
      determines the crossover frequency between the low and mid bands. The
      higher value of the range determines the crossover frequency between the
      mid and high bands. Both crossover frequencies range from 200 to 20,000.
