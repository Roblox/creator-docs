  **SocialService** facilitates social functions that impact relationships made
  on the Roblox platform. Its primary usage is to show
  [invite prompts](../../../production/promotion/invite-prompts.md) and the
  phone book to players, allowing them to send invitation requests to their
  connections through
  `Class.SocialService:PromptGameInvite()|PromptGameInvite()` and
  `Class.SocialService:PromptPhoneBook()|PromptPhoneBook()` respectively. You
  may leverage signals when such requests are made.

      Returns `true` if the given `Class.Player` can send a call invite to a
      connection. You should always use the result of this method before calling
      `Class.SocialService:PromptPhoneBook()|PromptPhoneBook()` since the
      ability to open the phone book may vary depending on the player.

      See [Roblox Connect](../../../resources/roblox-connect.md) for a sample
      implementation of this method.

      Returns the local player's RSVP status for the given event. Events must be
      in the current experience and must not have already started. If the event
      has already started, this method will return an error.

      Note that you can use

      prompt the player to change their RSVP status for the event.

    description: |
      Returns an array of dictionaries containing data for all members
      associated with the given `partyId`. The returned array reflects the
      current state of the party across all active server instances within the
      experience and it is ordered by the time each party member accepted the
      party invite. This means the first element in the array is the earliest to
      accept and the last is the most recent.

      This method is useful for retrieving up-to-date information about all
      party members currently in the experience and across different servers,
      enabling coordinated group behavior such as teleportation, matchmaking, or
      party-based gameplay logic.

      Each dictionary in the returned array contains the following fields:

      <table>

      The array includes only events that are currently active or have not yet
      ended, excluding cancelled, moderated, or unpublished events. Results are
      sorted so the soonest start time appears first.

      If the service indicates there are no matching events, this method returns
      an empty array. Requests may raise a `HttpError <status>` message if the
      service returns an unexpected error code.

    description: |
      Displays a feedback submission dialog to the player, allowing them to
      provide feedback about their experience. The submitted feedback becomes
      available to developers in the Creator Dashboard under the **Audience** >
      **Feedback** section.

      Players can submit feedback once per day per experience. Experience owners
      cannot submit feedback for their own experiences. If the player has
      already submitted feedback for the day, owns the experience, or is
      otherwise ineligible, the prompt will display a message indicating that
      feedback is unavailable.

      This method yields until the player either submits feedback or dismisses
      the dialog. As an asynchronous operation, it should be called using
      `task.spawn()` or within a coroutine.

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio.
      To test the feedback prompt, you must publish the experience and play it
      in the Roblox application.

      determine whether the player can send an invite, as this ability may vary
      depending on the platform or player.

      to check the player's current RSVP status before calling this method.
    code_samples:

    parameters:
      - name: eventId
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          The event ID of the event to prompt the player to change their RSVP
          status for. This must be a valid event ID that exists in the current
          experience, represented as a string (not a number).
    returns:

        summary: |
          Returns a `Enum.RsvpStatus` indicating the player's new RSVP status
          after the prompt is closed. If the player closes the prompt without
          changing their RSVP status, this will return `Enum.RsvpStatus.None` or
          their old `Enum.RsvpStatus` if they had already selected a status.
