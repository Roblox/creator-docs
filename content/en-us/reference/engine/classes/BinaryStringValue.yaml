    description: |
      Fires if the `Class.BinaryStringValue.Value` of the
      `Class.BinaryStringValue` is changed by the engine.

      In practice, this object is stored out of reach from normal scripts, so
      this event cannot be connected to. If a BinaryStringValue is created by a
      script, the engine will not do anything with it, so the event will never
      fire.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
