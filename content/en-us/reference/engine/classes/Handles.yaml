  The `Handles` object places 3D handles around any object that its
  `Class.Handles.Adornee|Adornee` is set to; this property must be set to a 3D
  object for the handles to appear. The color can be changed and the shape of
  the handles can be set to either arrows or spheres.

  For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's
  `Class.PlayerGui` or the `Class.CoreGui`.
