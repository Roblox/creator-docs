memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  Adjusts the dynamic range of input streams.
description: |
  `Class.AudioCompressor` adjusts the dynamic range of audio streams. Any
  momentary bursts of loudness will be clamped down according to the
  compressor's properties.

  `Class.AudioCompressor` provides **Input** and **Sidechain** pins that can be
  targeted by `Class.Wire.TargetName`, and an **Output** pin that can be used by
  `Class.Wire.SourceName`.

      Gain value to be applied after compression, in decibels. After limiting

      half whenever the input stream does so. Ranges from 1 to 50.

      Gain value at which the compressor will start to modify the input stream.
    description: |
      Gain value at which the compressor will start to modify the input stream,
      in decibels, with a range of -60 to 0. When the input stream's volume
      surpasses `Class.AudioCompressor.Threshold|Threshold`, the compressor will
      take `Class.AudioCompressor.Attack|Attack` seconds to kick in. When the
      input stream's volume recedes below
      `Class.AudioCompressor.Threshold|Threshold`, the compressor will take
      `Class.AudioCompressor.Release|Release` seconds to stop acting.

      If any `Class.Wire|Wires` are connected to the **Sidechain** pin of the
      compressor, this threshold analyzes those streams instead of the **Input**
      streams; this can be used to duck the volume of one stream in response to
      another.
