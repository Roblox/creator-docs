  Adjusts the dynamic range of input streams.
description: |
  `Class.AudioCompressor` adjusts the dynamic range of audio streams. Any
  momentary bursts of loudness will be clamped down according to the
  compressor's properties.

  `Class.AudioCompressor` provides **Input** and **Sidechain** pins that can be
  targeted by `Class.Wire.TargetName`, and an **Output** pin that can be used by
  `Class.Wire.SourceName`.

      Gain value to be applied after compression, in decibels. After limiting
      the dynamic range, the resulting stream may be very quiet and this
      property can be used to compensate. Ranges from -30 to 30.

      Ratio of input volume to output volume, to be applied when surpassing
      `Class.AudioCompressor.Threshold|Threshold`. For example, a value of 2
      will cut the amount by which the input stream exceeds the threshold in
      half whenever the input stream does so. Ranges from 1 to 50.

    summary: |
      Gain value at which the compressor will start to modify the input stream.
    description: |
      Gain value at which the compressor will start to modify the input stream,
      in decibels, with a range of -60 to 0. When the input stream's volume
      surpasses `Class.AudioCompressor.Threshold|Threshold`, the compressor will
      take `Class.AudioCompressor.Attack|Attack` seconds to kick in. When the
      input stream's volume recedes below
      `Class.AudioCompressor.Threshold|Threshold`, the compressor will take
      `Class.AudioCompressor.Release|Release` seconds to stop acting.

      If any `Class.Wire|Wires` are connected to the **Sidechain** pin of the
      compressor, this threshold analyzes those streams instead of the **Input**
      streams; this can be used to duck the volume of one stream in response to
      another.
