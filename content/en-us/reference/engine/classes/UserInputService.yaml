  `Class.UserInputService` is a service used to detect and capture the different
  types of input available on a user's device.

  The primary purpose of this service is to allow for experiences to cooperate
  with multiple forms of available input, such as gamepads, touch screens, and
  keyboards. It allows a `Class.LocalScript` to perform different actions
  depending on the device and, in turn, provide the best experience for the end
  user.

  Some usages of this service include detecting user input when they interact
  with GUIs, tools, and other game instances. In order to detect user input, the
  service must look for a service event. For example, the service can detect
  events such as when the user touches the screen of a mobile device using
  `Class.UserInputService.TouchStarted`, or connects a gamepad such as an Xbox
  controller to their device using `Class.UserInputService.GamepadConnected`.

  Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a
  `Class.LocalScript` or a `Class.ModuleScript` required by a
  `Class.LocalScript`. As UserInputService is client-side only, users in the
  game can only detect their own input - and not the input of others.

  See also `Class.ContextActionService`, a service which allows you to bind
  function to multiple user inputs.

      This property describes whether the user's device has an accelerometer

      An accelerometer is a component found in most mobile devices that measures
      acceleration (change in speed).

      For example, the following code snippet demonstrates how to check if the
      user's device has an accelerometer.

      ```lua
      local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local accelerometerEnabled = UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled
      if accelerometerEnabled then
      	print("Accelerometer enabled!")
      else
      	print("Accelerometer not enabled!")
      end
      ```

      If the device has an enabled accelerometer, you can get it's current
      acceleration by using the `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceAcceleration()`
      function or track when the device's acceleration changes by using the
      `Class.UserInputService.DeviceAccelerationChanged` event.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this property can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      A gyroscope is a component found in most mobile devices that detects
      orientation and rotational speed.

      If a user's device has a gyroscope, you can use incorporate it into your
      game using the `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceRotation()` function and

    summary: |
      Determines whether the user's mouse can be moved freely or is locked.
    description: |
      This property sets how the user's mouse behaves based on the
      `Enum.MouseBehavior` Enum. The default value is
      Enum.MouseBehavior.Default.

      It can be set to three values:

      1. _Default_: The mouse moves freely around the user's screen.
      2. _LockCenter_: The mouse is locked, and cannot move from, the center of
         the user's screen.
      3. _LockCurrentPosition_: The mouse is locked, and cannot move from, it's
         current position on the user's screen at the time of locking.

      The value of this property does not affect the sensitivity of events
      tracking mouse movement. For example,
      `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta` returns the same
      `Datatype.Vector2` screen position in pixels regardless of whether the
      mouse is locked or able to move freely around the user's screen. As a
      result, default scripts like those controlling the camera are not impacted
      by this property.

      This property is overridden if a `Class.GuiButton` with
      `Class.GuiButton.Modal|Modal` enabled is `Class.GuiButton.Visible` unless
      the player's right mouse button is down.

      Note that, if the mouse is locked, `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged`
      will still fire when the player moves the mouse and will pass in the Delta
      that the mouse attempted to move by. Additionally, if the player is kicked
      from the game, the mouse will be forcefully unlocked.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this property can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      This property determines the sensitivity of the user's `Class.Mouse`.

      The sensitivity determines the extent to which a movement of the physical
      mouse translates to a movement of the mouse in-game. This can be used to
      adjusted how sensitive events tracking mouse movement, like
      `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta`, are to mouse
      movement.

      This property does not affect the movement of the mouse icon. Nor does it
      affect the _Camera Sensitivity_ setting found in the _Settings_ tab of the
      client's _Settings_ menu, which also adjusts the sensitivity of events
      tracking mouse movement.

      This property has a maximum value of 10 and a minimum value of 0. A lower
      value corresponds to lower sensitivity, and a higher value to higher
      sensitivity.

      When sensitivity is 0, events that track the mouse's movement will still
      fire but all parameters and properties indicating the change in mouse
      position will return `Datatype.Vector2|Vector2.new()`, or
      `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3.new()` in the case of `Class.InputObject.Delta`.
      For example, `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta` will
      always return (0, 0).

    description: |
      This function returns whether the given `Enum.UserInputType` gamepad
      supports a button corresponding with the given `Enum.KeyCode`. This
      function is used to determine valid gamepad inputs.

      To determine which `Enum.UserInputType` gamepads are connected, use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetConnectedGamepads()`.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this function can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      This function returns an array of `Enum.UserInputType` gamepads currently
      connected. If no gamepads are connected, this array will be empty.
      Additionally, it only returns UserInputType objects that are gamepads. For
      instance, this event will return a connected Gamepad1 object but not a
      Keyboard object.

      For example, the following code snippet retrieves the connected gamepads
      and stores them in a variable named _connectedGamepads_.

      ```lua
      local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
      local connectedGamepads = userInputService:GetConnectedGamepads()
      ```

      To check if a specific gamepad is connected, use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetGamepadConnected()`.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this function can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      The GetDeviceAcceleration function determines the current acceleration of
      the user's device. It returns an `Class.InputObject` that describes the
      device's current acceleration.

      In order for this to work, the user's device must have an enabled
      accelerometer. To check if a user's device has an enabled accelerometer,
      you can check the `Class.UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled` property.

      If you want to track when the user's device's acceleration changes
      instead, you can use the
      `Class.UserInputService.DeviceAccelerationChanged` event.

      Since it only fires locally, it can only be used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    summary: |
      Returns an `Class.InputObject` describing the device's current gravity
      vector.
    description: |
      This function returns an `Class.InputObject` describing the device's
      current gravity vector.

      The gravity vector is determined by the device's orientation relative to
      the real-world force of gravity. For instance, if a device is perfectly
      upright (portrait), the gravity vector is
      `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3.new(0, 0, -9.18)`. If the left side of the
      device is pointing down, the vector is Vector3.new(9.81, 0, 0). Finally,
      if the back of the device is pointing down, the vector is Vector3.new(0,
      -9.81, 0).

      This function might be used to enable the user's device to impact or
      control gravity within the game or move in-game objects such as a ball.

      Gravity is only tracked for players using a device with an enabled
      gyroscope - such as a mobile device.

      To check if a user's device has an enabled gyroscope, check the value of
      `Class.UserInputService.GyroscopeEnabled`. If the device has an enabled
      gyroscope, you can also use the
      `Class.UserInputService.DeviceGravityChanged` event to track when force of
      gravity on the user's device changes.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this function can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      This is fired with an InputObject. The _Position_ property of the input
      object is a `Enum.InputType|Enum.InputType.Gyroscope` that tracks the

    description: |
      **GetStringForKeyCode** returns a string representing a key the user
      should press in order to input a given `Enum.KeyCode`, keeping in mind
      their keyboard layout. For key codes that require some modifier to be
      held, this function returns the key to be pressed in addition to the
      modifier. See the examples below for further explanation.

      When using Roblox with a non‑QWERTY keyboard layout, key codes are mapped
      to equivalent QWERTY positions. For example, pressing <kbd>A</kbd> on an
      AZERTY keyboard results in `Enum.KeyCode.Q`. This mapping can lead to
      mismatched information on experience UI elements. For example, "Press
      <kbd>M</kbd> to open the map" is inaccurate on an AZERTY keyboard; it
      would need to be "Press <kbd>?</kbd> to open the map" which is in the same
      position as <kbd>M</kbd> on QWERTY. This function solves this issue by
      providing the actual key to be pressed while using non‑QWERTY keyboard
      layouts.

      ```
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local textLabel = script.Parent
      local mapKey = Enum.KeyCode.M
      textLabel.Text = "Press " .. UserInputService:GetStringForKeyCode(mapKey) .. " to open the map"
      ```

      #### Gamepad Usage

      `Class.UserInputService:GetStringForKeyCode()|GetStringForKeyCode()`
      returns the string mapping for the `Enum.KeyCode` for the most recently
      connected gamepad. If the connected controller is not supported, the
      function returns the default string conversion for the requested key code.

      The following example shows how you can map custom assets for
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA|ButtonA`:

      ```
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local imageLabel = script.Parent
      local key = Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA

      local mappings = {
        ButtonA = "rbxasset://BUTTON_A_ASSET",  -- Replace with the desired ButtonA asset
        ButtonCross = "rbxasset://BUTTON_CROSS_ASSET"  -- Replace with the desired ButtonCross asset
      }

      local mappedKey = UserInputService:GetStringForKeyCode(key)
      local image = mappings[mappedKey]

      imageLabel.Image = image
      ```

      #### Gamepad Mappings

      The directional pad key codes do not have any differences based on device.
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonSelect` has slightly different behavior in some cases.
      Use both PlayStation mappings to ensure users see the correct buttons.

      #### System Images for KeyCodes

      When using a `Enum.KeyCode` that may be better represented as an image,
      such as for an `Class.ImageLabel` in a user interface, you can use the
      following legacy icons. However, it's recommended that you use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetImageForKeyCode()|GetImageForKeyCode()` as a
      more modern, cross‑platform method to retrieve Xbox and PlayStation
      controller icons.

      This function returns an array of `Enum.KeyCode|KeyCodes` that the gamepad
      associated with the given `Enum.UserInputType` supports.

      This function can be used to determine which KeyCodes are supported and
      not supported by a connected gamepad. To determine if a specific KeyCode
      is supported, use `Class.UserInputService:GamepadSupports()`.

      If called on a non existent, or non connected, gamepad, this function will
      return an empty array.

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this function can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      Returns a `Datatype.CFrame` describing the position and orientation of a

    description: |
      The `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()` function returns a
      `Datatype.CFrame` describing the position and orientation of a specified
      `Enum.UserCFrame` virtual reality (VR) device. If the specified device is
      not connected, the function returns `Datatype.CFrame|CFrame.new()`.

      For example, the code snippet below prints the CFrame of the user's VR
      headset.

      ```lua
      local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
      local cframe = userInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)

      print(cframe)
      ```

      By using the function, players can implement features such as
      re-positioning the user's in-game character corresponding to the location
      of a connected VR device. This can be done by changing the _CFrame_ of the
      user's in-game body parts to match the _CFrame_ of the specified VR device
      using `Enum.UserCFrame` and `Datatype.CFrame` value arguments passed by
      the event.

      See also:

      - `Class.UserInputService.UserCFrameChanged`, an event which fires when
        the `Datatype.CFrame` of a VR device changes
      - `Class.VRService`, a service used to implement VR support

      As this event only fires locally, it can only be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript`.

      The DeviceAccelerationChanged event fires when a user moves a device that
      has an accelerometer.

      An accelerometer is a component found in most mobile devices that measures
      acceleration (change in speed).

      To determine whether a user's device has an accelerometer enabled,
      see`Class.UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled`.

      This event can be used to track the movement of a device that has an
      accelerometer. A sample usage includes moving the player character when a
      mobile device accelerates.

      Additionally, this event can be used along with
      `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceAcceleration()` to determine the current
      movement of a user's device if the device has an accelerometer.

      This event only fires locally - which means that only the player whose
      device moves can use the event and it will only work in a
      `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      The `Class.UserInputService.DeviceGravityChanged` event fires when the
      device's gravity `Datatype.Vector3` changes on a device that has an
      accelerometer.

      A device's gravity vector represent the force of gravity on each of the
      device's X, Y, and Z axes. While gravity never changes, the force it
      exerts on each axis changes when the device rotates and changes
      orientation. The force value exerted on each axis is a unit vector ranging
      from -1 to 1.

      An accelerometer is a component found in most mobile devices that measures
      acceleration (change in speed).

      This event can be used to determine the real-world direction of the force
      of gravity on a user's device. This even can then be used to simulate the
      force of gravity on a user's device within the game, such as on in-game
      objects (see example below).

      To check if a user's device has an enabled accelerometer, see
      `Class.UserInputService.AccelerometerEnabled`. If the device has an
      enabled accelerometer, you can use the
      `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceGravity()` function to get the current
      force of gravity on the user's device.

      The DeviceRotationChanged event fires when a user rotates a device that
      has a gyroscope.

      A gyroscope is a component found in most mobile devices that detects
      orientation and rotational speed.

      The event is useful when tracking the orientation of the device and how
      changes as the user rotates their device. To determine the current device
      rotation, you can use the `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceRotation()`
      function.

      To check if a user's device has an enabled gyroscope, and that this event
      will fire, see `Class.UserInputService.GyroscopeEnabled`.

      This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For

      The GamepadConnected event fires when a gamepad is connected to the
      client.

      Since a Roblox game supports multiple controllers, this event is useful
      when paired with the `Class.UserInputService.GamepadDisconnected` event to
      track which controllers/gamepads are active. You can also use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetConnectedGamepads()` to find the correct
      gamepad to use.

      The following example demonstrates a usage example of a tracking when a
      gamepad is connected to the client.

      ```lua

      end)

      userInputService.GamepadConnected:Connect(GamepadConnected)

  - name: UserInputService.JumpRequest
    summary: |
      Fires whenever the client makes a request for their character to jump.
    description: |
      The `Class.UserInputService` JumpRequest event fires when there is a jump
      request from the client, for example when the client presses the spacebar
      or jump button on mobile.

      This event fires whenever the user tries to make their
      `Class.Player.Character` jump. Default behavior responds to a jump request
      by setting the player's `Class.Humanoid.Jump` property to true, which
      makes the player's character jump.

      The event can be used to track every time a player wants to jump. Instead
      of using it to make a player jump, this should be used to change default
      jump behavior - such as disabling jumping.

      For example, the code below prints "Jump" every time the player sends a
      jump request.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function onJumpRequest()
          print("Jump!")
      end

      UserInputService.JumpRequest:Connect(onJumpRequest)
      ```

      Since this event fires multiple times for a single jump request, using a
      [debounce](../../../scripting/debounce.md) is suggested.

      If you would like to connect keys or buttons to other actions, consider
      using events such as `Class.UserInputService:GetKeysPressed()` and
      `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan` or the `Class.ContextActionService`.

      As this event only fires locally, it can only be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript`.

      Thumbstick2).

      To get the value of the last input type, regardless of whether it has

      Fired when the client loses focus on a `Class.TextBox`.
    description: |
      The TextBoxFocusReleased event fires when a client loses focus on a
      TextBox - typically when a client stops text entry into a TextBox by
      pressing return or clicking/touching elsewhere on the screen.

      For example, the code below prints the name of the TextBox losing focus
      when the event fires.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function TextBoxFocusReleased(textbox)
      	print(textbox.Name)
      end

      UserInputService.TextBoxFocusReleased:Connect(TextBoxFocusReleased)
      ```

      It can be used alongside `Class.UserInputService.TextBoxFocused` to track
      when a TextBox gains and loses focus.

      As this event only fires locally, it can only be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript`.

      The TextBoxFocused event fires when a gains focus on a `Class.TextBox` -
      typically when a client clicks/taps on a text box to begin inputting text.
      This also fires if a text box focus is focused using
      `Class.TextBox:CaptureFocus()`.

      For example, the code below prints the name of the TextBox focused when
      the event fires.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function TextBoxFocused(textbox)

    summary: |
      Fired when a user releases their finger from the screen on a TouchEnabled
      device - such as the screen of a mobile device.
    description: |
      The TouchEnded event fires when a user released their finger from the
      screen of a TouchEnabled device, ending touch input with the device.

      This event can be used to determine when a user stops touching the screen
      of their device. It can be paired with
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchStarted` to determine when a user starts and
      stops touching the screen.

      For example, the code below prints the screen position where the user
      stops touching the screen.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function TouchEnded(touch, gameProcessedEvent)
      	print("Touch ended at "..tostring(touch.Position))
      end

      UserInputService.TouchEnded:Connect(TouchEnded)
      ```

      The touch input object is the same input object throughout the lifetime of
      the touch. So comparing `Class.InputObject|InputObjects` when they are
      touch objects is valid to determine if it is the same finger.

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will
      fire, see `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled`.

      This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For

      Fired when a user holds at least one finger for a short amount of time on

      This event can be used to determine when a user holds their finger down on
      an in-game `Class.GuiObject|GUI` or element.

      The example below prints the `Enum.UserInputState|state` of the long press
      when the user holds at least one finger for a short amount of time on the
      same screen position. Possible states include: _Begin_, _Change_, _End_,
      _Cancel_, and _None_.

      ```lua
      local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function TouchLongPress(TouchPositions, state, gameProcessedEvent)

    description: |
      The TouchMoved event fires when a user moves their finger on a
      TouchEnabled device.

      This event can be used to determine when a user moves their finger while
      touching the screen of a TouchEnabled device. It can be useful to track
      whether a user is moving their finger on the screen, as well as where the
      user is moving their finger.

      The code below prints "Touch moved from" the previous Vector2 position "to
      " the new Vector2 position of the user's touch on a TouchEnabled device.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      function onTouchMoved(touch, gameProcessedEvent)
      	local oldPosition = touch.Position - touch.Delta
      	print("Touch moved from " .. tostring(oldPosition) .. "to " .. tostring(touch.Position))
      end

      UserInputService.TouchMoved:Connect(onTouchMoved)
      ```

      It can be paired with `Class.UserInputService.TouchStarted` and
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnded` to determine when a user starts
      touching the screen, how their finger moves while touching it, and when
      the they stop touching the screen.

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will

      The TouchPan event fires when a user drags at least one finger on a

      This event can be used to determine when a user pans their finger along
      screen of a TouchEnabled device - such as to rotate the `Class.Camera` in
      a custom camera script.

      The snippet below prints "Speed of touch drag" followed by the velocity of
      the user's touch when the user drags their finger on the screen.

      screen of a mobile device.
    description: |
      The TouchRotate event fires when a user rotates two fingers on a
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` device.

      For example, the following code prints how much the camera has rotated
      since the beginning of the touch rotation.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      UserInputService.TouchRotate:Connect(function(touchPositions, rotation, velocity, state, gameProcessedEvent)
      	print("Camera has rotated "..tostring(rotation).." degrees!")
      end)
      ```

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will
      fire, see `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled`.

      This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For
      example, inputs will not be captured when the window is minimized.

      As this event only fires locally, it can only be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript`.

      The core scripts that control the user's camera on a mobile device use
      code that functions similarly to this event. Best practice for this event
      is to use it when creating a mobile camera system to override the default
      core scripts.

      Fired when a user places their finger on a TouchEnabled device - such as
      the screen of an Apple iPad or iPhone or a Google Android phone.
    description: |
      The TouchStarted event fires when a user places their finger on a
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` device, beginning touch
      input with the device.

      This event can be used to determine when a user starts touching the screen
      of their device. It can be paired with `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnded`
      to determine when a user starts and stops touching the screen.

      The touch input object is the same input object throughout the lifetime of
      the touch. So comparing `Class.InputObject|InputObjects` when they are
      touch objects is valid to determine if it is the same finger.

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will
      fire, see `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled`.

      This event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus. For
      example, inputs will not be captured when the window is minimized.

      This event can be used to determine when a user swipes their fingers on
      the screen of their device and the direction that the user swiped.

      For more precise tracking of touch input movement, use using
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchMoved`

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will

      This event will fire regardless of whether the user touches/taps the game
      world or a `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element. If you are looking for an event
      that only fires when the user touches/taps the game world, use
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchTapInWorld`.

      To check if a user's device is TouchEnabled, and that touch events will

      The TouchTapInWorld event fires when the user touches/taps their finger on
      the screen on a `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` device.
      It is fired when the user taps in the game world.

      This event can be used to determine when a user taps the screen and does
      not tap a `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element. If the user taps a GUI element,
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchTap` will fire instead of TouchTapInWorld.

    description: |
      The UserCFrameChanged event fires when the `Datatype.CFrame` of a VR
      device changes.

      This event can be used to track the movement of a connected VR device.

      Using the event, you can implement features such as moving the user's
      in-game character limbs as the user moves their VR device. This can be
      done by changing the CFrame of the user's in-game limbs to match the
      CFrame changes of the VR device using the `Enum.UserCFrame` enum and
      _CFrame_ value arguments passed by the event.

      To retrieve the `Datatype.CFrame` of a connected VR device, use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()`.

      As the event fires locally, it can only be used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      The `Class.UserInputService` WindowFocusReleased event fires when the
      window of the Roblox client loses focus - typically when the Roblox client
      is minimized by the user.

      For example, the code below prints _"Window focus released"_ whenever the
      Roblox client loses focus.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      UserInputService.WindowFocusReleased:Connect(function()
