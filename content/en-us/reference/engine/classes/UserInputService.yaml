  `UserInputService` is primarily used to detect the input types available on a
  user's device, as well as detect input events. It allows you to perform
  different actions depending on the device and, in turn, provide the best
  experience for the end user.

  As this service is intended for client-side usage only, its properties,
  methods, and events can only be used in a `Class.LocalScript`, a
  `Class.ModuleScript` required by a `Class.LocalScript`, or a `Class.Script`
  with `Class.BaseScript.RunContext|RunContext` set to `Enum.RunContext.Client`.

    description: |
      This property describes whether the user's device has an accelerometer, a
      component found in most mobile devices that measures acceleration (change
      in speed).

      If the device has an enabled accelerometer, you can get its current
      acceleration by using the
      `Class.UserInputService:GetDeviceAcceleration()|GetDeviceAcceleration()`
      method or track when the device's acceleration changes through the
      `Class.UserInputService.DeviceAccelerationChanged|DeviceAccelerationChanged`
      event.

      Toggles whether Roblox's mobile controls are hidden on mobile devices.
    description: |
      The `ModalEnabled` property determines whether character controls are
      hidden on `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` devices. By
      default, this property is `false` and controls are visible.

      This property will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript` running
      for the player whose character controls are to be hidden.

      Even if mobile controls are hidden for a player on a touch‑enabled device,
      other events such as `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan|InputBegan` and
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchSwipe|TouchSwipe` can still be used to
      process other forms of input.

    summary: |
      Determines whether the user's mouse can be moved freely or is locked.
    description: |
      This property sets how the user's mouse behaves based on the
      `Enum.MouseBehavior` enum. It can be set to three values:

      - `Enum.MouseBehavior.Default` &mdash; The mouse moves freely around the
        user's screen.
      - `Enum.MouseBehavior.LockCenter` &mdash; The mouse is locked and cannot
        move from the center of the user's screen.
      - `Enum.MouseBehavior.LockCurrentPosition` &mdash; The mouse is locked and
        cannot move from its current position on the user's screen at the time
        of locking.

      The value of this property does not affect the sensitivity of events
      tracking mouse movement. For example,
      `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta` returns the same
      `Datatype.Vector2` screen position in pixels regardless of whether the
      mouse is locked or able to move freely around the user's screen. As a
      result, default scripts like those controlling the camera are not impacted
      by this property.

      This property is overridden if a `Class.GuiButton` with
      `Class.GuiButton.Modal|Modal` enabled is `Class.GuiButton.Visible|Visible`
      unless the player's right mouse button is down.

      Note that if the mouse is locked,
      `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged|InputChanged` will still fire when
      the player moves the mouse and will pass in the delta that the mouse
      attempted to move by. Additionally, if the player is kicked from the
      experience, the mouse will be forcefully unlocked.

      This property determines the sensitivity of the user's `Class.Mouse`. It
      can be used to adjust the sensitivity of events tracking mouse movement,

      This property does not affect the movement of the mouse icon, nor the
      camera sensitivity that the user has selected for their client.

      This property has a maximum value of `10` and a minimum value of `0`. When
      sensitivity is `0`, events that track the mouse's movement will still fire
      but all parameters and properties indicating the change in mouse position
      will return `0`.

      Queries the primary input type a player is using, based on anticipated
      user behavior.
    description: |
      This read-only property lets you query the **primary** input type a player
      is likely using, based on anticipated user behavior, to ensure UI elements
      like on‑screen buttons and menus work elegantly across devices. For
      example, a touch‑enabled device assumes touch is the default input and
      that touch buttons may appear for actions, but if a player connects an
      additional bluetooth keyboard/mouse or gamepad, you can assume they want
      to switch to that as the primary input type and possibly use touch as a
      backup input for on‑screen UI.

      The value of `PreferredInput` changes based on built‑in device inputs and
      the player's most recent interaction with a connected gamepad or
      keyboard/mouse. Examples include:

      <table>

      This method returns an `Class.InputObject` describing the device's current
      gravity vector. The vector is determined by the device's orientation
      relative to the real-world force of gravity. For example:

      - `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3.new(0, 0, -9.18)` if the device is perfectly
        upright (portrait)
      - `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3.new(9.81, 0, 0)` if the left side of the
        device is pointing down
      - `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3.new(0, -9.81, 0)` if the back of the device is
        pointing down

      Gravity is only tracked for devices with an enabled gyroscope as queried

    description: |
      This method returns a string representing a key the user should press in
      order to input a given `Enum.KeyCode`, keeping in mind their keyboard
      layout. For key codes that require some modifier to be held, this method
      returns the key to be pressed in addition to the modifier. See the
      examples below for further explanation.

      When using Roblox with a non‑QWERTY keyboard layout, key codes are mapped
      to equivalent QWERTY positions. For example, pressing <kbd>A</kbd> on an
      AZERTY keyboard results in `Enum.KeyCode.Q`, potentially leading to
      mismatched information on experience UI elements. This method solves the
      issue by providing the actual key to be pressed while using non‑QWERTY
      keyboard layouts.

      <table size="small">

          <tr>
            <th>KeyCode</th>

      #### Gamepad Usage

      `GetStringForKeyCode()` returns the string mapping for the `Enum.KeyCode`
      for the most recently connected gamepad. If the connected controller is
      not supported, the method returns the default string conversion for the
      requested key code.

      The following example shows how you can map custom assets for
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA|ButtonA`:

      ```
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local imageLabel = script.Parent
      local key = Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA

      local mappings = {
      	ButtonA = "rbxasset://BUTTON_A_ASSET", -- Replace with the desired ButtonA asset
      	ButtonCross = "rbxasset://BUTTON_CROSS_ASSET"  -- Replace with the desired ButtonCross asset
      }

      local mappedKey = UserInputService:GetStringForKeyCode(key)
      local image = mappings[mappedKey]

      imageLabel.Image = image
      ```

      #### Gamepad Mappings

      The directional pad key codes do not have any differences based on device.
      `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonSelect` has slightly different behavior in some cases.
      Use both PlayStation mappings to ensure users see the correct buttons.

      #### Legacy System Images

      When using a `Enum.KeyCode` that may be better represented as an image,
      such as for an `Class.ImageLabel` in a user interface, you can use the
      following legacy icons. However, it's recommended that you use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetImageForKeyCode()|GetImageForKeyCode()` as a
      more modern, cross‑platform method to retrieve Xbox and PlayStation

    summary: |
      Returns a `Datatype.CFrame` describing the position and orientation of a

    description: |
      The `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()` method returns a
      `Datatype.CFrame` describing the position and orientation of a specified
      `Enum.UserCFrame` virtual reality (VR) device. If the specified device is
      not connected, the method returns `Datatype.CFrame|CFrame.new()`.

      For example, the code snippet below prints the CFrame of the user's VR
      headset.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
      local cframe = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)

      print(cframe)
      ```

      By using the method, players can implement features such as re-positioning
      the user's in-game character corresponding to the location of a connected
      VR device. This can be done by changing the _CFrame_ of the user's in-game
      body parts to match the _CFrame_ of the specified VR device using
      `Enum.UserCFrame` and `Datatype.CFrame` value arguments passed by the
      event.

      - `Class.UserInputService.UserCFrameChanged`, an event which fires when
        the `Datatype.CFrame` of a VR device changes
      - `Class.VRService`, a service used to implement VR support

      As this event only fires locally, it can only be used in a

      A device's gravity vector represent the force of gravity on each of the

      This event fires when a user taps their finger on the screen of a
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` device and the tap
      location is in the 3D world rather than on a `Class.GuiObject` element.

      Note that this event only fires when the Roblox client window is in focus.
      It will not fire when the window is minimized.

    summary: |
      Fires when the `Datatype.CFrame` of a specified Virtual Reality device
      changes.
    description: |
      The UserCFrameChanged event fires when the `Datatype.CFrame` of a VR
      device changes.

      This event can be used to track the movement of a connected VR device.

      Using the event, you can implement features such as moving the user's
      in-game character limbs as the user moves their VR device. This can be
      done by changing the CFrame of the user's in-game limbs to match the
      CFrame changes of the VR device using the `Enum.UserCFrame` enum and
      _CFrame_ value arguments passed by the event.

      To retrieve the `Datatype.CFrame` of a connected VR device, use
      `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()`.

      As the event fires locally, it can only be used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      See also:

      - `Class.VRService`, used to implement support, including an identical
        event `Class.VRService.UserHeadCFrameChanged`
      - `Class.Camera.HeadLocked`, when this property is `true` the
        `Class.Camera` will automatically track the head motion of a player
        using a VR device
      - `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()`, a method which retrieves the
        `Datatype.CFrame` the `Class.Camera` is being orientated at, including
        the impact of VR devices
