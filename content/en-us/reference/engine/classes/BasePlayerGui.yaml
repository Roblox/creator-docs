methods:
  - name: BasePlayerGui:GetGuiObjectsAtPosition
    summary: |
      Returns a list of all `Class.GuiObject` instances occupying the given
      point on the screen.
    description: |
      Takes a screen position and returns a list of all the `Class.GuiObject`
      instances that are occupying that screen position, sorted in the order
      they appear on-screen from top to bottom as the first and last index,
      respectively.

      The main use case is to get GUI objects under the player's mouse or touch
      inputs to do things like allow selection or highlighting. These effects
      can already be achieved using `Class.GuiObject.MouseEnter` and
      `Class.GuiObject.MouseLeave` but this requires the developer to track
      these events for their UI objects all the time even if they only need this
      functionality in specific circumstances.

      Since the child classes of `Class.BasePlayerGui` inherit this function, it
      can be fired by class objects such as the `Class.PlayerGui` and
      `Class.StarterGui` folders.

          The y position on the screen relative to the top left corner after the

    returns:
      - type: Instances
        summary: |
          A table of the `Class.GuiObject` instances that occupy the given
          screen space.
