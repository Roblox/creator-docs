  The BlockMesh object applies a 'brick' mesh to the `Class.BasePart` it is
  parented to. It behaves identically to a `Class.SpecialMesh` with
  `Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType` set to 'Brick'.

  ## What does a BlockMesh do?

  A BlockMesh gives the `Class.BasePart` it was applied to a brick shaped mesh.
  It is identical in appearance to a standard Roblox `Class.Part`.

  The dimensions of the mesh will scale linearly in all directions with
  `Class.BasePart.Size`, this means a part containing a BlockMesh can be resized
  the same way as any other part.

  The additional functionality a BlockMesh brings however, is the ability to set
  the `Class.DataModelMesh.Scale` and `Class.DataModelMesh.Offset` properties.
  These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be
  changed without changing the `Class.BasePart.Position` or
  `Class.BasePart.Size` of the `Class.BasePart` the mesh is parented to.

  Note as the `Class.BlockMesh` object does not include a texture the
  `Class.DataModelMesh.VertexColor` property does not do anything.
