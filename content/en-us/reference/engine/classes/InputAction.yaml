  `InputAction` defines a gameplay action mechanic such as "Jump," "Sprint," or
  "Shoot." These actions are then mapped to hardware inputs using
  `Class.InputBinding`. An `InputAction` will check for its first ancestor type
  of `Class.InputContext` and register itself to that context (if there is no
  ancestor context, it will be registered to a default context).

      Updates the `InputAction` to the given state and fires the appropriate
      signals.
    description: |
      Updates the `InputAction` to the given state and fires the appropriate
      signals. This method is most useful for script‑triggered "input" where the
      passed `state` should trigger events like
      `Class.InputAction.Pressed|Pressed` or
      `Class.InputAction.StateChanged|StateChanged` regardless of whether the
      player triggered that state through normal inputs.

      This method will only accept a `state` parameter that matches the
      `Class.InputAction.Type|Type` and attempting to call it with a mismatched
      type will cause an error, for example passing a state of `0.5` when the
      `Class.InputAction.Type|Type` is `Enum.InputActionType|Bool`.

      Note that this method follows the conditions of
      `Class.InputAction.Pressed|Pressed`,
      `Class.InputAction.Released|Released`, and
      `Class.InputAction.StateChanged|StateChanged`. For example, if you make
      multiple consecutive calls to `Fire()` with a state of `true`,
      `Class.InputAction.StateChanged|StateChanged` will only fire on the first
      state change and the subsequent calls to `Fire()` will do nothing.
