  The **Shirt** object displays a Shirt texture from the Roblox website on a
  `Class.Humanoid` rig. Shirts cover the torso and arms, and will take priority
  over a `Class.Pants` on the torso. To be visible, a Shirt must be a sibling of
  a Humanoid and have its `Class.Shirt.ShirtTemplate|ShirtTemplate` property set
  to an appropriate texture (such as `rbxassetid://86896487`, pictured to the
  right). The shirt texture may be colorized using the `Class.Clothing.Color3`
  property.

  Shirts are automatically loaded on `Class.Player` characters if their avatar
  is wearing one.

      #### Finding the ShirtTemplate ID

      This content ID is different than the website URL of the shirt. It can be
      found by pasting the website URL of the shirt into the **ShirtTemplate**
      property in Studio, as Studio will correct it. Alternatively
      `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` can be used to insert the shirt into the
      workspace, for example:

      ```
      local webURL = "https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1804747/White-Shirt"
      local assetId = tonumber(string.match(webURL, "%d+") or 0)  -- Extract the number
      local success, model = pcall(function()
      	return game:GetService("InsertService"):LoadAsset(assetId)
      end)
      if success then
      	model.Parent = workspace
      end
      ```
