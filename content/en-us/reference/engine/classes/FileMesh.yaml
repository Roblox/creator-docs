  ## What is a FileMesh?

  FileMeshes allow user uploaded meshes to be applied to a `Class.BasePart`. The
  mesh that is applied is dependent on the `Class.FileMesh.MeshId` property. A
  texture can also be applied to this mesh using `Class.FileMesh.TextureId`.

  Although it is not an abstract class, and can be used by developers, all
  `Class.FileMesh` properties are inherited by the `Class.SpecialMesh` object. A
  `Class.SpecialMesh` behaves identically to the FileMesh object when its
  `Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType` is set to 'FileMesh'. Although both objects are
  functional, the `Class.SpecialMesh` object is the official supported class.

  For more information on using meshes, please see the `Class.SpecialMesh` page.

      The MeshId is the content ID of the mesh that is to be displayed.

      The MeshId is the content ID of the mesh that is to be displayed.

      The content ID for a mesh is generated when a developer uploads a mesh to
      the Roblox website.

      #### How do I create a mesh?

      Meshes can currently only uploaded using `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts` or the
      asset manager. Once uploaded however, the content ID for the mesh can be
      used for the MeshId property. For more information, see
      [Meshes](../../../parts/meshes.md).

    summary: |
      The TextureId is the content ID of the texture that is to be applied to
      the mesh.
    description: |
      The TextureId is the content ID of the image that is to be applied to used
      for the meshes texture. When the TextureId property is set to an empty
      string, no texture will be applied to the mesh.

      #### How can I change the texture of a mesh?

      Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without
      having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be
      uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image
      file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the 'Export Selection'
      option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the
      exported .obj file.

      The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its
      content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.

      #### How can I make a textured mesh?

      A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped. UV mapping
      refers to the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This
      cannot be done using Roblox Studio and has to be done using an external 3D
      modelling application such as [Blender][1].
