  The Decal object is an object which applies an image to a face of a
  `Class.BasePart`.

  ## How does a Decal work?

  A Decal will apply an image to the `Class.BasePart` it is parented to. The
  surface this image is applied to is dependent on the `Class.FaceInstance.Face`
  property. The size of the decal is dependent on the size of the face, meaning
  the size and aspect ratio of a decal can be changed by changing its parent's
  `Class.BasePart.Size`.

  The image a Decal applies is determined by its `Class.Decal.Texture` property.
  Images can be uploaded to Roblox provided they adhere to the community
  guidelines.For information on how to upload images, see
  [Textures and Decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md).

  ## Alternatives to Decals

  Although Decals have a wide variety of applications, in some cases developers
  may wish to pick one of the following classes instead.

  - For repeated tiled textures, the `Class.Texture` object should be used
  - To apply GUI elements, the `Class.SurfaceGui` object should be used
  - If the effect of lighting on the image needs to be altered, the
    `Class.SurfaceGui` object should be used

      The `Datatype.Color3` tint of the `Class.Decal`.

      Developers should note that this property only sets the tint of the decal,
      rather than the color. This means, unless the image associated with the
      `Class.Decal` was originally white (RGB = 1,1,1) then the color cannot be
      freely changed using this property.

      By reducing the RGB properties of `Datatype.Color3` in union, developers
      can make a decal darker.

      Acts as a multiplier for the decal's `Class.Decal.Transparency` property.
      The effects are only visible to the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`.

      This property should be used in situations where
      `Class.Decal.Transparency` is being set by a different script. The benefit
      of LocalTransparencyModifier is that it can be changed without concern for
      the original `Class.Decal.Transparency` of the `Class.Decal`

      When LocalTransparencyModifier is set to 1, the `Class.Decal` will be
      completely invisible regardless of its original transparency. When it is
      set to 0, the decal's rendered transparency will match the
      `Class.Decal.Transparency` value. The formula for this is:

      ```
      Displayed Transparency = Transparency + ((1 - Transparency) * LocalTransparencyModifier)
      ```

      Note, this property should be used on the client only and will not
      replicate to the server.

      For a variant of this property for `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, see
      `Class.BasePart.LocalTransparencyModifier`.

      #### How can I upload a Decal?

      Images can be uploaded to Roblox provided they adhere to the community
      guidelines. For information on how to upload images, see
      [Textures and Decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md).

      #### How to find do I find a Decal's Content ID?

      Unlike with `Class.Sound` and `Class.Animation` objects, the Content ID of
      a Decal is not the same as the number in the URL. There are two main ways
      of finding the Content ID of a Decal:

      - Paste the URL into the Texture property in Roblox Studio. Roblox will
        automatically update the property to the correct Content ID. Note this
        only works in Roblox Studio and cannot be done from Scripts or while the
        game is running.
      - Insert the Decal into the game, this is generally done through the
        Toolbox under 'My Decals'. The Content ID can be found in the decal that
        is inserted. Note, `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` can also be used if
        developers wish to automate this method.

      Determines the transparency of the `Class.Decal` with 0 being completely
      opaque and 1 completely transparent.

      Note, `Class.Decal|Decals` also respect the transparency of the original
      image file uploaded to Roblox. This means transparency can be changed
      prior to uploading to Roblox, and without the need to use the Transparency
      property.

      `Class.Decal.LocalTransparencyModifier` acts as a multiplier for the
      Decal's transparency and should be used when the transparency of the decal
      is likely to be changed by another script, as is the case with player
      Characters.

      For `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, see `Class.BasePart.Transparency`.

      Determines the rendering order when multiple Decals are assigned the same
      face.
    description: |
      **ZIndex** determines the order in which decals on the same
      `Class.Decal.Face|Face` of a `Class.BasePart` are rendered. Decals are
      rendered in **ascending** priority order, where lower values are rendered
      first. Therefore, a decal with a higher ZIndex renders later (and on top
      of) other Decals with lower ZIndex.

      The range of valid values is -MAX_INT to MAX_INT, inclusive (2,147,483,647
      or (2^31 - 1)). If you are unsure if you will need to layer a decal
      between two already-existing decals in the future, it can be a good idea
      to use multiples of 100, i.e. 0, 100, 200. This ensures a large gap of
      ZIndex values you can use for elements rendered in-between other elements.

        GUI elements
