name: Decal
type: class
memory_category: GraphicsTexture
summary: |
  Applies an image texture to a face of a parent `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  The `Class.Decal` object applies an image texture to a face of a parent
  `Class.BasePart`. The affected face is dependent on the
  `Class.Decal.Face|Face` property, and the size of the decal is dependent on
  the size of the face.

  The applied image texture is determined by its
  `Class.Decal.ColorMapContent|ColorMapContent` property. For details on how to
  upload images, see
  [asset management](../../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-management).

  For more information, review
  [textures and decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md). See also:

  - `Class.Texture` for repeating surface images.
  - `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent` to apply an image texture to a
    `Class.MeshPart`.
  - `Class.SurfaceGui` to apply an `Class.ImageLabel` or `Class.ImageButton` to
    an in-experience 3D object.

      The `Datatype.Color3` tint of the `Class.Decal`. Note that this property
      only sets the **tint** of the decal rather than the color; unless the
      image associated with the `Class.Decal` was originally pure white, then
      the color cannot be freely changed using this property.

      Acts as a multiplier for the decal's
      `Class.Decal.Transparency|Transparency` property. The effect is only
      visible to the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` and will not
      replicate to the server.

      When this property is set to `1`, the `Class.Decal` will be completely
      invisible regardless of its original transparency. When it is set to `0`,
      the decal's rendered transparency will match the
      `Class.Decal.Transparency|Transparency` value.

    description: |
      This property determines the order in which decals on the same
      `Class.Decal.Face|Face` of a `Class.BasePart` are rendered. Lower values
      are rendered first, so a decal with a higher `ZIndex` renders on top of
      those with a lower `ZIndex`.

      If you're unsure whether you'll need to layer a decal between two
      already-existing decals in the future, use larger separations between
      `ZIndex` values such as `10` or `100` to ensure space for future decals
      between.
