    summary: |
      Returns an array of user information including user name and display name.
    description: |
      This function lets you request information about users outside of the
      current `Class.DataModel` in bulk. The input and output values are both
      arrays.

      - The order of the user info objects in the return value's array may not
        match the order of the `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` sent in the input
        parameter's array. Use the `Id` field of the user info object to
        identify your input array with the output array.
      - It's possible to receive fewer user info objects than requested if one
        or more of the `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` in the request array are
        invalid, such as negative numbers or user IDs that don't have accounts
        associated with them. It's possible to receive a response with zero
        results if all `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` are invalid.
      - If a Roblox user does not have a `Class.Player.DisplayName|DisplayName`
        associated with their account, this function will instead return the
        same string as the user's username in their info object's `DisplayName`
        field. While a user's `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` will never change,
        they may change their username or display name, so the same input
        `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` may return a different string for these
        fields from one day to another.
      - Since
        `Class.UserService:GetUserInfosByUserIdsAsync()|GetUserInfosByUserIdsAsync()`
        makes an external web request, it will yield and may fail if the backend
        service is experiencing interruptions. Ensure you can handle downtime
        appropriately by wrapping this method with a
        `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()`.
      - Results are limited to 250 per minute, so if you receive an HTTP 429
        error, try again later, ideally after reducing the number of
        `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` in your input array, reducing the number
        of method calls, or both.

      The signature of a singular user info object is:

      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Id</code></td>
        <td>number</td>
        <td>The
        <code>Class.Player.UserId|UserId</code> associated with the user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>Username</code></td>
        <td>string</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>DisplayName</code></td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>The

        user.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>HasVerifiedBadge</code></td>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td>The
        <code>Class.Player.HasVerifiedBadge|HasVerifiedBadge</code> value
        associated with the user.</td>
      </tr>
