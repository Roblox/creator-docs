  Creates NPC billboard-style dialog bubbles.
description: |
  The Dialog object allows users to create non-player characters (NPCs) that
  players can talk to using a list of choices. The Dialog object can be inserted
  into a part such as a Humanoid's head, and then a player will see a speech
  bubble above the part that they can click on to start a conversation. The
  creator of a place can choose what choices the player can say by inserting
  `Class.DialogChoice` objects into the dialog.

      Sets whether the Dialog can be used by multiple players at once.
    description: |
      The BehaviorType of a Dialog determines whether multiple players can
      interact with a dialog at once. The default value for this property is
      SinglePlayer.

      #### SinglePlayer

      When a Dialog is configured to SinglePlayer, only one player can interact
      with it at a time. As soon as a player engages with a dialog, other
      players will not be able to initiate the dialog until the first player is
      finished.

      While a player is engaged with a dialog, the other players will see the
      dialog choices of the player who started the dialog, along with the
      responses.

      #### MultiplePlayers

      When a Dialog is set to MultiplePlayers, any player can initiate a dialog
      at any time, even if another player has already initiated the dialog.
      Unlike SinglePlayer however, Dialogs set to MultiplePlayers will not show
      the dialog choices and responses to anyone but the player in the
      conversation.

      ```lua
      local singlePlayerDialog = Instance.new("Dialog")
      local singlePlayerPart = game.Workspace.SinglePlayerPart
      singlePlayerDialog.BehaviorType = Enum.DialogBehaviorType.SinglePlayer
      singlePlayerDialog.InitialPrompt = "Only one person can interact with me at once."
      singlePlayerDialog.Parent = singlePlayerPart

      local multiplePlayersDialog = Instance.new("Dialog")
      local multiplePlayersPart = game.Workspace.MultiplePlayersPart
      multiplePlayersDialog.BehaviorType = Enum.DialogBehaviorType.MultiplePlayers
      multiplePlayersDialog.InitialPrompt = "Any number of players can interact with me at once."
      multiplePlayersDialog.Parent = multiplePlayersPart
      ```
