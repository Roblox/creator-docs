  Connects two `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` together such that their relative
  position and orientation remain the same.
description: |
  **WeldConstraint** connects two `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and ensures they
  stay in the same relative position/orientation to each other, meaning that if
  one part moves, the other moves the same amount. Even if the two parts are not
  touching, they can be welded together.

  The most common way to create a weld constraint is by selecting **Weld**
  through Studio's **Create** menu in the [Model](../../../studio/model-tab.md)
  tab.

  Note that this tool behaves differently depending on how many
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are selected when the tool is activated:

  - If no `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are selected, the next two
    `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` clicked will be connected by a new
    `Class.WeldConstraint`. If the same `Class.BasePart` is clicked twice, no
    constraint will be created.
  - If one `Class.BasePart` is already selected, the next `Class.BasePart`
    clicked will be connected to the selected one with a new
    `Class.WeldConstraint`.
  - If multiple `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are selected, those which are
    touching or overlapping will be automatically welded together by new
    `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints`.

  #### Repositioning Behavior

  Moving a welded `Class.BasePart` behaves differently depending on whether the
  part was moved through its `Class.BasePart.Position|Position` or through its
  `Datatype.CFrame`.

  - If a welded part's `Class.BasePart.Position|Position` is updated, that part
    will move but none of the connected parts will move with it. The weld will
    recalculate the offset from the other parts based on the moved part's new
    position.

  - If a welded part's `Datatype.CFrame` is updated, that part will move **and**
    all of the connected parts will also move, ensuring they maintain the same
    offset as when the weld was created.

    description: |
      True if the WeldConstraint is currently active in the world.

      If the WeldConstraint or one of its parts is not in `Class.Workspace` the
      weld will be inactive.

      Rigid joints like `Class.Weld`, `Class.Snap`, `Class.WeldConstraint`,
      `Class.Motor`, or `Class.Motor6D` may also be disabled due to conflicts
      with other rigid joints, such as joints between the same two parts or
      indirect cycles in the weld graph. Joints disabled this way may be
      re-enabled later when another joint or part is added or removed.

      Duplicate WeldConstraints do not conflict because WeldConstraints derive
      their internal CFrames from the relative positions of their parts when
      they are enabled and all update when `Class.BasePart.Position` or
      `Class.BasePart.Orientation` is set on a part. The spanning tree may still
      disable them if they are redundant or form a cycle.

    description: |
      The **Enabled** property of a `Class.WeldConstraint` sets whether the
      constraint is active or not. When this property is set to true, if the
      constraint's `Class.WeldConstraint.Part0` and `Class.WeldConstraint.Part1`
      properties are set, then the constraint will ensure that its two connected
      parts will be locked together.

      The **Part0** and `Class.WeldConstraint.Part1` properties of a
      `Class.WeldConstraint` set which two `Class.BasePart` the weld connects.
      As soon as both properties are set and the weld is
      `Class.WeldConstraint.Enabled`, the weld will lock the two parts together.

      If Part0 or Part1 are ever set to new parts, then the WeldConstraint will
      instantly link the new part. The old part will no longer be constrained.

      ```lua
      local partA = Instance.new("Part")
      local partB = Instance.new("Part")

      partA.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      partA.Parent = workspace

      partB.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 10)
      partB.Parent = workspace

      local weld = Instance.new("WeldConstraint")
      weld.Parent = partA
