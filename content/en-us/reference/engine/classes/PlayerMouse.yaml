  The PlayerMouse behaves identically to the `Class.Mouse` object that is
  obtained using `Class.Tool.Equipped`. It can be accessed from
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` using the local player's
  `Class.Player:GetMouse()` method. Both PlayerMouse and `Class.Mouse` are
  legacy APIs, superseded by `Class.UserInputService`.

  The only difference between the PlayerMouse and the `Class.Mouse` object is
  the PlayerMouse can be obtained using the `Class.Player:GetMouse()` method.

  In most cases developers are advised to use the new `Class.UserInputService`.
  However the PlayerMouse and Mouse objects remain supported for a number of
  reasons. See [Input and Camera](../../../input/index.md) for more information
  on customizing inputs in your experience.
