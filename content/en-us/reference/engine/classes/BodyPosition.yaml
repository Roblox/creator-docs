name: BodyPosition
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a force to maintain a constant position.
description: |
  The `BodyPosition` object applies a force on an assembly such that it will
  maintain a constant position in the world. The
  `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position` property, not to be confused with
  `Class.BasePart.Position`, controls the target world position. This is the
  translational counterpart to a `Class.BodyGyro`.

  If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a
  `Class.BodyForce` or `Class.BodyThrust` instead.

  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several
  factors, namely the distance to the goal position: the force is stronger when
  farther away from the goal. This is amplified by `Class.BodyPosition.P|P`
  (power). The present velocity will also dampen the force applied by this
  object, and this is amplified by `Class.BodyPosition.D|D` (dampening). The
  resulting force is then capped by `Class.BodyPosition.MaxForce|MaxForce`. Note
  the force applied on the assembly to achieve the goal position may vary on a
  per-axis basis.

    summary: |
      Determines the amount of dampening to use in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`.
    description: |
      This property determines how much dampening will be applied to the force
      used toward reaching the goal `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. When
      the assembly approaches the goal position it needs to decelerate,
      otherwise it will move past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate
      back toward the goal. This is often creates an undesirable
      "rubber‑banding" effect, avoided by applying dampening. The higher this
      value is set, the greater the dampening curve becomes, or the slower the
      assembly will approach the goal position.

      This property determines the limit on the amount of force that may be
      applied on each axis in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. If an assembly isn't moving,
      consider increasing this value and also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored assemblies.

    summary: |
      Determines how aggressive of a force is applied in reaching the goal
      position.
    description: |
      This property determines how much power is used while applying force in
      order to reach the goal `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. The higher
      this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
      The force the `Class.BodyPosition` exerts increases as the difference
      between the assembly's current position and the goal position increases.
      This property is multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish
      it.
