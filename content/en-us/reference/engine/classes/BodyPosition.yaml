  Applies a force to maintain a constant position.
description: |
  The **BodyPosition** object applies a force on a `Class.BasePart` such that it
  will maintain a constant position in the world. The
  `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position` property, not to be confused with
  `Class.BasePart.Position`, controls the target world position. This is the
  translational counterpart to a `Class.BodyGyro`. If you need further control
  on a force applied to an object, consider using a `Class.BodyForce` or
  `Class.BodyThrust` instead.

  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several
  factors, namely the distance to the goal position: the force is stronger when
  farther away from the goal. This is amplified by `Class.BodyPosition.P|P`
  (power). The present velocity will also dampen the force applied by this
  object, and this is amplified by `Class.BodyPosition.D|D` (dampening). The
  resulting force is then capped by `Class.BodyPosition.MaxForce|MaxForce`. Note
  the force applied on the part to achieve the goal position may vary on a
  per-axis basis.

  - name: BodyPosition.D
    summary: |
      Determines the amount of dampening to use in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`.
    description: |
      The D property determines how much **dampening** will be applied to the
      force used toward reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. When the part approaches the goal
      position it needs to decelerate, otherwise it will move past the goal and
      have to stop and re-accelerate back toward the goal. This is often creates
      undesirable **rubber-banding** effect, so applying dampening using this
      property is how that effect is avoided. The higher this value is set, the
      greater the dampening curve becomes, or the slower the part will approach
      the goal position.

    description: |
      The MaxForce property determines the limit on the amount of force that may
      be applied on each axis in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. If a part isn't moving, consider
      increasing this value (also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored parts).

    summary: |
      Determines how aggressive of a force is applied in reaching the goal
      position.
    description: |
      The P property determines how much
      [power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
      applying force in order to reach the goal
      `Class.BodyPosition.Position|Position`. The higher this value, the more
      power will be used and the faster it will be used. The force the
      `Class.BodyPosition` exerts increases as the difference between the part's
      current position and the goal position increases. This property is
      multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish it.
