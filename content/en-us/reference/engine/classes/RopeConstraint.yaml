name: RopeConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Simulates rope dynamics, preventing two attachments from separating further
  than a defined length.
description: |
  A **RopeConstraint** prevents two attachments from separating further than a
  defined `Class.RopeConstraint.Length|Length`. The attachments can move closer
  together than this length and both can freely rotate. This constraint can also
  be powered to behave as a motorized winch.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Winch

  If a rope's `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchEnabled|WinchEnabled` property is
  enabled, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set separation
  specified by `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget`, effectively the
  target length of the rope in studs. This translation is controlled by
  `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed`,
  `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchResponsiveness|WinchResponsiveness`, and
  `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchForce|WinchForce`.

  Note that `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed` must be a **positive**
  value, used to either contract or extend the rope length to
  `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget`. Setting a negative speed will
  revert to 0, not reverse the winch servo direction.
