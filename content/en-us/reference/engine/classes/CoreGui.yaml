  in Roblox Studio.

  You can use the `Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled()` and
  `Class.StarterGui:GetCoreGuiEnabled()` methods in a `Class.LocalScript` to
  enable and disable most elements of the CoreGui. You can also use
  `Class.PlayerGui:SetTopbarTransparency()` to set the transparency of the top
  bar.
