name: Script
type: class
memory_category: Script
summary: |
  An object that contains and runs Luau code on the server.
description: |
  A `Class.Script` is a Luau source container that can access server-side
  objects, properties, and events, such as to award badges to players using
  `Class.BadgeService`, while `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` on the client
  cannot.

  The instant that the following conditions are met, a script's code is run in a
  new thread:

  - Its `Class.Script.Enabled|Enabled` property is `true`.
  - The `Class.Script` object is a descendant of the `Class.Workspace` or
    `Class.ServerScriptService`.

  The script will continue to run until the above conditions are **not** met, it
  terminates, or it raises an error (unless that error is raised by a function
  connected to some event that is firing). Additionally, the thread will be
  stopped if the script or one of its ancestors is destroyed. A script will
  continue to run even if the `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` property is set to
  `nil` and the `Class.Script` is not destroyed.

      The code to be executed.
    description: |
      Represents the code to be executed. It's protected and discouraged for
      editing directly. Attempting to access this property in a `Class.Script`
      or `Class.LocalScript` causes errors.

      If you want to read or modify the source of a script that a user has open,
      use `Class.ScriptEditorService` to interact with the
      [Script Editor](../../../studio/script-editor.md) rather than directly
      modifying this property. Both
      `Class.ScriptEditorService:UpdateSourceAsync()` and
      `Class.ScriptEditorService:GetEditorSource()` can read or modify script
      content from the script editor if the script is opened. You can also read
      the source from the
      [command line](../../../studio/ui-overview.md#command-bar).
