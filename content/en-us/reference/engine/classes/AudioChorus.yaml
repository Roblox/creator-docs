  Makes an audio stream sound more voluminous. If applied to a single voice, it
  may sound like multiple voices.
description: |
  `Class.AudioChorus` makes an audio stream sound more voluminous. It provides
  one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be connected to/from by
  `Class.Wire|Wires`.

  `Class.AudioChorus` is implemented by duplicating the input stream and
  modulating the pitch of several delayed copies so that the overall result
  sounds like a cloud of streams. If applied to a single voice, it may sound
  like multiple voices.
