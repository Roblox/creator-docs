name: FloatCurve
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A sorted list of time-value pairs that define a curve. Used to animate a
  single numerical value.
description: |
  An instance representing a 1D float curve encoded via a sorted list of
  `Datatype.FloatCurveKey|FloatCurveKeys`. The shape of the interpolation curve
  between two keys is determined by the `Datatype.FloatCurveKey.Interpolation`
  type.

      length if no key was found). The second item in the returned array is the
      index of the first key with time greater than or equal to `time` (or the
      curve length if no key was found satisfying the inequality).

      Resets this curve's keys using the `Datatype.FloatCurveKey` array passed
