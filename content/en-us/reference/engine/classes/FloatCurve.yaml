summary: |
  A sorted list of time-value pairs (`Datatype.FloatCurveKey|FloatCurveKeys`)
  that define a curve. Used to animate a single numerical value.
description: |
  An instance representing a 1D float curve encoded via a sorted list of
  `Datatype.FloatCurveKey|FloatCurveKeys`.

  `Datatype.FloatCurveKey|FloatCurveKeys` are value-time points that represent
  the changes in value over time. The changes of a single value over time are
  represented by a curve. Animators can edit keys to modify a curve. The shape
  of the curve is dictated by the `Enum.KeyInterpolationMode` chosen at each
  key.

    summary: |
      Returns key indices before and after time.
    description: |
      The first returned value is the index of the last key with
      `key.time <= time` (or `min(1,length)` if no key was found). The second
      returned value is the index of the first key with `key.time >= time` or
      the length of the curve if no key was found satisfying the inequality.

      Adds the key passed as argument to this curve. If a key exists at the same
      time it will be replaced. First return value is true if a key was added,
      false if a previous key was replaced. Second return value is the index at
      which the marker was added.

      Resets this curve's keys using the FloatCurveKey array passed as argument.
      Keys in the keysArray are sorted in ascending time order before insertion.
      Keys at duplicated times are removed in a stable manner. Returns the
      number of keys actually inserted.

      Keys previously stored in this curve are removed before the keys passed as
      arguments are added.
