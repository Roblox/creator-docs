  An object that references an animation asset (`AnimationId`) which can be
  loaded by a `Class.Humanoid` or `Class.AnimationController`.

  ## Load an Animation on the client or server

  In order for `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` to replicate correctly,
  it's important to know when they should be loaded on the client (via
  a`Class.LocalScript`) or on the server (via a `Class.Script`).

  If an `Class.Animator` is a descendant of a Humanoid or AnimationController in
  a Player's `Class.Player.Character|Character` then animations started on that
  Player's client will be replicated to the server and other clients.

  If the Animator is not a descendant of a player character, its animations must
  be loaded and started on the server to replicate.

  The Animator object must be initially created on the server and replicated to
  clients for animation replication to work at all. If an Animator is created
  locally, then AnimationTracks loaded with that Animator will not replicate.

  Both `Class.Humanoid:LoadAnimation()` and
  `Class.AnimationController:LoadAnimation()` will create an Animator if one
  does not already exist. When calling LoadAnimation from LocalScripts you need
  to be careful to wait for the Animator to replicate from the server before
  calling LoadAnimation if you want character animations to replicate. You can
  do this with WaitForChild("Animator").

    summary: |
      Content ID of the animation an `Class.Animation` object is referencing.
      Once an animation has been created and uploaded to Roblox the content ID
      can be found in the uploaded animation's URL.

      This property is the content ID of the animation an `Class.Animation`
      object is referencing. Once an animation has been created and uploaded to
      Roblox the content ID can be found in the uploaded animation's URL.

      This URL is presented immediately after an animation has been uploaded to
      Roblox, in the Animation Editor export window. It can also be found in the
      Develop tab on the Roblox site, under 'Animations'.

      It's important to remember the URL is not the same as the content ID. It
      will work when pasted directly into the AnimationId property of an
      `Class.Animation` in Roblox studio, as Studio will automatically correct
      it, however if it is being set from a `Class.Script` then the correct
      content ID will need to be used, using the number from the URL. For
      example:

      ```lua
      "https://www.roblox.com/catalog/507771019" -- Web URL (will not work)
      "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=507771019" -- Content ID (will work)
      "rbxassetid://507771019" -- Content ID (alternative version, will work)
      ```

      Note, the animation will need to be loaded onto an `Class.AnimationTrack`
      in order to play it.
