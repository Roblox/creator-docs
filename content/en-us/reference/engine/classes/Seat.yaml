  A type of `Class.BasePart` that characters can 'sit' in. When a character
  touches an enabled Seat object, it will be attached to the part by a
  `Class.Weld` and the default character scripts will play a sitting animation.

  ## How do Seats work?

  When a model containing a `Class.Humanoid` and a `Class.BasePart` called
  'HumanoidRootPart' (generally a player character) touches a seat, a
  `Class.Weld` is created between the seat and the part. The
  `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0` and `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` properties are
  configured so that the character is welded 2 studs above the seat. This weld
  is named 'SeatWeld' and parented to the seat.

  When sitting the `Class.Seat.Occupant` property is set to the `Class.Humanoid`
  that is 'sitting' in the seat. Furthermore the `Class.Humanoid.SeatPart`
  property of the humanoid is set to the seat.

  A character can also be forced to sit in a seat using the `Class.Seat:Sit()`
  function.

  There are two ways for a character to get out of a seat. When a player jumps,
  they are removed from the seat. However this can also be done manually by
  destroying the seat weld, for example:

      seat:FindFirstChild("SeatWeld"):Destroy()

  Note seats have a cooldown (currently 3 seconds) that is on a per-character
  per-seat basis. This means once a character has gotten out of a seat they
  cannot sit back on the same seat for 3 seconds. This cooldown behavior may
  change and should not be relied upon by developers.

  ## What can Seats be used for?

  Seats have a diverse range of uses, ranging from the obvious to the more
  unconventional.

  - Creating chairs or benches without the need for any programming
  - Allowing characters to 'sit' in moving objects such as vehicles without
    getting flung around
  - Creating interfaces that are controlled by the character in the seat using
    the `Class.Seat.Occupant` property
