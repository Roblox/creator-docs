  A KeyframeMarker is an instance meant to represent an event that will
  eventually be fired when a `Class.Keyframe` is hit.

  ## Using a KeyframeMarker

  KeyframeMarkers should always be parented to a Keyframe via setting the parent
  directly or using the `Class.Keyframe:AddMarker()` function of Keyframe.
  KeyframeMarkers can also be removed directly or using the
  `Class.Keyframe:RemoveMarker()` function, and polled to check which markers
  are attached to a specific Keyframe using `Class.Keyframe:GetMarkers()`.

  Whenever a Keyframe is detected as an animation is running, there will be an
  event fired for each KeyframeMarker that is parented to the Keyframe. These
  events are identifiable by the name of the KeyframeMarker. You can retrieve
  and listen to these events using the
  `Class.AnimationTrack.GetKeyframeMarkerReached` function. Optionally, you may
  set the `Class.KeyframeMarker.Value` property of the KeyframeMarker in order
  to pass along a value with the event being fired.

  It inherits the `Class.Instance.Name|Keyframe.Name` property from
  `Class.Instance` and behaves identically. Names are used for identification
  and do not need to be unique. When multiple `KeyframeMarker` instances with
  the same name are attached to a `Class.Keyframe`, events such as the one
  returned by `Class.AnimationTrack:GetMarkerReachedSignal()` will fire for
  every marker.

  - `Class.Keyframe`, holds the `Class.Pose|Poses` applied to joints in a
    `Class.Model` at a given point of time in an animation
  - `Class.AnimationTrack`, controls the playback of an animation on a
    `Class.Humanoid` or `Class.AnimationController`
  - `Class.Animation`, holds a reference to animation data required to play
    custom animations on characters or other models using the Roblox animation
    system

      A value that is specified for a `Class.KeyframeMarker`. Whenever the
      signal created from `Class.AnimationTrack:GetMarkerReachedSignal()` gets
      fired, this value will be passed into the connected function.
