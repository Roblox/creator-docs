  The **Pants** object displays a Pants texture from the Roblox website on a
  `Class.Humanoid` rig. Pants cover the torso and legs, and will be covered by a
  `Class.Shirt` on the torso. To be visible, a Pants must be a sibling of a
  Humanoid and have its `Class.Pants.PantsTemplate|PantsTemplate` property set
  to an appropriate texture (such as `rbxassetid://86896501`, pictured to the
  right). The pants texture may be colorized using the `Class.Clothing.Color3`
  property.

  Pants are automatically loaded on `Class.Player` characters if their avatar is
  wearing one.

      #### How do I find the PantsTemplate?

      This content ID is different to the website URL of the pants. The content
      ID can be found by pasting the website URL of the pants into the
      PantsTemplate property in Roblox Studio, as studio will correct it.
      Alternatively `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` can be used to insert the
      pants into the workspace, for example:

          local webURL = "https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1804739/Jeans"
          local assetId = tonumber(string.match(webURL, "%d+") or 0) -- extract the number
          local success, model = pcall(function()
          	return game:GetService("InsertService"):LoadAsset(assetId)
          end)
          if success then
          	model.Parent = workspace
          end

      For a `Class.Shirt` object's template, see `Class.Shirt.ShirtTemplate`.
