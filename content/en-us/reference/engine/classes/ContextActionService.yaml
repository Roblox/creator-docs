  A service used to bind user input to contextual actions.
description: |
  Allows an experience to bind user input to contextual actions, or actions that
  are only enabled under some condition or period of time. For example, allowing
  a player to open a door only while close by. In code, an action is simply a
  string (the name of the action) used by the service to differentiate between
  unique actions. The action string is provided to
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` and
  `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction`, among other member
  functions. If two actions are bound to the same input, the most recently bound
  will take priority. When the most recent action is unbound, the one bound
  before that takes control again. Since this service deals with user input, you
  can only use it in client-side `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`.

  ## What is a context?

  A **context** is simply a condition during which a player may perform some
  action. Some examples include holding a `Class.Tool`, being
  `Class.Seat|seated` in a car or standing near a door. Whatever the case may
  be, it is up to your `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` to call
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` when the context is
  entered and `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction` when the
  context is left.

  ## What is an action?

  An **action** is simply some input that can be performed by the player while
  in that context. Such an action could open/close some menu, trigger a
  secondary tool action or send a request to the server using
  `Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer()`. An action is identified by a unique
  string as the first parameter of both
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` and
  `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction`. The string can be
  anything, but it should reflect the **action being performed, not the input
  being used**. For example, don't use "KeyH" as an action name - use "CarHorn"
  instead. It is best to define your actions as a constant at the top of your
  script since you will use it in at least three different places in your code.

  ## Why bind actions contextually?

  It's better to use ContextActionService's
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` than
  `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan` for most cases. For
  `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan`, your connected function would have to
  check if the player is in the context of the action being performed. In most
  cases, this is harder than just calling a function when a context is entered/
  left. For example, if you want to have the `H` key trigger a car horn sound
  while the player is sitting in it, the player might type "hello" in chat or
  otherwise use the `H` key for something else. It is harder to determine if
  something else is using the H key (like chat) - the car might honk when the
  player didn't mean to. If you instead use
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` and
  `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction` when the player
  enters/leaves the car, `Class.ContextActionService` will make sure that `H`
  key presses trigger the honk action only when it is the most recently bound
  action. If something else (like chat) takes control, you won't have to worry
  about checking that.

  ## Inspecting Bound Actions

  To see a list of actions and their bound inputs, you can inspect the "Action
  Bindings" tab in the Developer Console (F9 while in game). This shows all
  bindings - including those bound by Roblox CoreScripts and default
  camera/control scripts too. This is useful for debugging: check if your
  actions are being bound/unbound at the correct times, or if some other action
  is stealing input from your actions. For example, if you are attempting to
  bind WASD, it may be the case that default character movement scripts are
  binding over those same keys. Similarly, the camera control script can steal
  right-click input if the script runs after yours.

  ## Keyboardless Input

  This service is especially useful for supporting gamepad and touch input. For
  gamepad input, you might choose to bind the B button to an action that returns
  the user to the previous menu when they enter another menu. For touch,
  on-screen touch buttons can be used in place of key presses: these buttons
  display only while the action is bound, and the position, text and/or images
  of these buttons can be configured through this service. They're somewhat
  limited in the amount of customization provided by this service; it's usually
  a better idea to make your own on-screen buttons using `Class.ImageButton` or
  `Class.TextButton`.

      Bind user input to an action given an action handling function.
    description: |
      Bind an action to user input given an action handling function. Upon a
      matching input being performed, the action handler function will be called
      with the arguments listed below. Valid input enum items include those
      within the following: `Enum.KeyCode`, `Enum.UserInputType` or
      `Enum.PlayerActions` . Call this function when a player **enters the
      context** in which an action can be performed. When the player leaves the
      context, call `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction`
      with the same `actionName`. You can manually call the action handling
      function of an action by using
      `Class.ContextActionService:CallFunction()|CallFunction`.

      The code sample below shows how a `Class.Sound` can be
      `Class.Sound:Play()|played` while a key (<kbd>H</kbd>), game pad button,
      or touch screen button is pressed.

      ```lua
      local ContextActionService = game:GetService("ContextActionService")

      -- A car horn sound
      local honkSound = Instance.new("Sound", workspace)
      honkSound.Looped = true
      honkSound.SoundId = "rbxassetid://9120386436"

      local function handleAction(actionName, inputState, inputObject)
      	if actionName == "HonkHorn" then
      		if inputState == Enum.UserInputState.Begin then
      			honkSound:Play()
      		else
      			honkSound:Pause()
      		end
      	end
      end

      -- When the player sits in the vehicle:
      ContextActionService:BindAction("HonkHorn", handleAction, true, Enum.KeyCode.H, Enum.KeyCode.ButtonY)

      -- When the player gets out:
      ContextActionService:UnbindAction("HonkHorn")
      ```

      #### Action Handler Parameters

      The action handler functions are called with the following parameters:

      <table>
      <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td><code>string</code></td>
        <td>The same string that was originally passed to BindAction†</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td><code>Enum.UserInputState</code></td>
        <td>The state of the input (Begin, Change, End or Cancel)*</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td><code>InputObject</code></td>
        <td>An object that contains information about the input (varies based on UserInputType)</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

      † This allows one function to handle multiple actions at once, if
      necessary. \*Cancel is sent if some input was in-progress and another
      action bound over the in-progress input, or if the in-progress bound
      action was `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|unbound`.

      #### Action Bindings Stack

      Action bindings behave like a stack: if two actions are bound to the same
      user input, the **most recently bound** action handler will be used. If an
      action handler returns `Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass`, the next most
      recently bound action handler will be called, and so on until a handler
      sinks the input (by returning `nil` or `Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink`).
      When `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction` is called,
      the action handler is removed from the stack. This stack behavior can be
      overridden using
      `Class.ContextActionService:BindActionAtPriority()|BindActionAtPriority`,
      where an additional priority parameter after `createTouchButton` may
      override the order in which actions are bound (higher before lower).

      #### Touch Buttons

      In addition to input types, this function's third parameter controls
      whether a button is created for
      `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` devices. Upon the first
      touch button's creation, a `Class.ScreenGui` named "ContextActionGui" is
      added to the `Class.PlayerGui`. Inside the ScreenGui is a `Class.Frame`
      called "ContextButtonFrame" is added. It is in this frame in which
      `Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons` for bound actions are parented; you can
      use `Class.ContextActionService:GetButton()|GetButton` to retrieve such
      buttons for customization.

      Binds _functionToBind_ to input events such as key presses, mouse
      movement, or controller input.
    description: |
      This function binds _functionToBind_ to input events such as key presses,
      mouse movement, or controller input. The specific input types the engine
      listens for are listed as parameters of BindAction. Whenever a player uses
      any of these input types, the Roblox engine calls "functionToBind".
      BindAction sets the priorityLevel via `Enum.ContextActionPriority` to
      Default.Value, which is 2000. Use `Class.ContextActionService:GetButton()`
      to control the priority of bound events.

      In addition to input types, BindAction has a createTouchButton parameter.
      When this is set to true it creates an `Class.ImageButton` on any device
      with a touchscreen. A `Class.ScreenGui` is also created to put the context
      buttons into named ContextActionGui and is parented to `Class.PlayerGui`.
      The created ImageButton is parented to this ContextActionGui. GetButton
      can be used to retrieve the button that was created.

      If an input has more than one function bound to it, each function will be
      placed on a stack. A stack obeys the principle of last in first out. So
      the first object placed on the stack will be on the top. The next object
      placed on the stack becomes the top and the previous object moves one
      position down (like a stack of books). When the input is triggered, the
      function at the top of the stack is called. If the function returns
      `Enum.ContextActionResult`.Pass this will continue down the stack. To
      remove a function from being called by all input that it was bound by use
      `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()`.

      BindAction allows control over whether or not a bound action should be
      processed by other actions on the stack using `Enum.ContextActionResult`.
      If `Enum.ContextActionResult.Pass` is returned in the callback function,
      every action below it in the stack (last function called gets executed
      first) will get a chance to process it. Anything other than Pass will be
      treated as `Enum.ContextActionResult.Sink`, including nil. It will also
      sink if the callback is yielded.

      nothing and throws no error.

      This function is part of a family of methods that customize the touch
      button of an action. Others in this family include

      Unbind an action from input given its name.
    description: |
      UnbindAction will unbind an action by name from user inputs so that the
      action handler function will no longer be called. Call this function when
      the context for some action is no longer applicable, such as closing a
      user interface, exiting a car or `Class.Tool.Unequipped|unequipping` a
      `Class.Tool`. See `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` for
      more information on how bound actions operate.

      This function **will not** throw an error if there is no such action bound
      with the given string. Using
      `Class.ContextActionService:GetAllBoundActionInfo()|GetAllBoundActionInfo`
      or the Developer Console's "Action Bindings" tab, you can find out what
      actions are presently bound.

      Retrieves a `Class.ImageButton` of a

    description: |
      GetButton returns the `Class.ImageButton` created by
      `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction` if its third
      parameter was true and the device is

      this function must match exactly the name of the action originally sent to
      BindAction.

      If no such action was bound or if a button was not created, this function
      returns `nil`.
