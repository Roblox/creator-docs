  A special object that emits customizable 2D billboard particles into the
  world.
description: |
  A **ParticleEmitter** is a special object that emits customizable 2D billboard
  particles into the world. To emit and render particles, it must be parented to
  a `Class.BasePart` or an `Class.Attachment` within such a part. When parented
  to a `Class.BasePart`, particles spawn randomly within the part's **bounding
  box** or [shape](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md#shape); when parented
  to an `Class.Attachment`, particles spawn from the attachment's position.

  Particles emit automatically when the emitter is
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled|Enabled` with a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rate|Rate`, or manually when the
  `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()|Emit` method is called. With a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed`, particles are set in motion outwards
  and/or inwards, depending on the `Class.ParticleEmitter.ShapeInOut|ShapeInOut`
  property.

  By default, particles face the camera, but the
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Orientation|Orientation` can be modified to respect the
  particle velocity instead.

  During the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime` of the particles, they
  can change appearance according to the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color|Color` and
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size|Size`. Their motion can change over time according
  to the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag` and
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Acceleration|Acceleration` properties, and they can
  also move as their parent moves when they are
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.LockedToPart|LockedToPart` or have a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance|VelocityInheritance`.

  Roblox provides several pre-made particle effect objects of `Class.Fire`,
  `Class.Smoke` and `Class.Sparkles`. They behave similarly to a
  **ParticleEmitter** but lack the control methods of
  `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()|Emit` and `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()|Clear`.
  An `Class.Explosion` also creates particles, but provides minimal control with
  regards to how the effect looks.

  To learn more about creating and customizing particle emitters, see
  [Particle Emitters](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md).

  - name: ParticleEmitter.Acceleration
    summary: |
      Determines the global-axis acceleration of all alive particles, measured
      in studs per second squared.
    description: |
      The Acceleration property determines how particles
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed` changes over the particle's lifetime. It is
      defined using a `Datatype.Vector3` to determine the acceleration on the
      global X/Y/Z axes. It is measured in studs per second squared. When
      changed, this property affects all particles emit by the emitter, both
      current and future particles.

      Acceleration will slow particles down if the vector points in the opposite
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection` in which particles are emitted.
      Otherwise, it will speed them up. You can use `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag`
      to slow particles down no matter what direction they travel.

      Acceleration is most often used to apply a gravity effect to particles
      (try a value of (0, -3, 0) for this). You can also use small values on the
      X/Z axes to make it look like particles are being blown away by wind. If
      you emit a bubble particle downwards, you could use an acceleration of (0,
      5, 0) to cause the bubbles to decelerate and then float back upwards.

    summary: |
      Determines the color of all active particles over their individual
      lifetimes.
    description: |
      The Color property determines the color of all active particles over their
      individual lifetimes. The color applies to the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture` when rendering, and it uses the texture
      alpha along with the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency`. If a particle
      has a `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightEmission` value that's greater than 0,
      darker colors make particles appear more transparent.

      Note that the default `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` is 5 to 10 seconds,
      so some particles next to each other have small variations in color due to
      the variations in individual particle lifetime.

      A particle's present color is determined by linearly interpolating on this
      ColorSequence using the particle's age and the particle's total lifetime.
      For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second
      lifetime, the color will be whatever is 50% of the way through the
      `Datatype.ColorSequence`.

      Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the
      system. This is because the color of a particle is determined using its
      present lifetime and this ColorSequence (the ColorSequence when the
      particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

    summary: |
      Determines the rate at which particles will lose half their speed through
      exponential decay.
    description: |
      The Drag property determines the rate in seconds at which individual
      particles will lose half their speed via exponential decay.

      Drag is applied by scaling the expected velocity (from
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed` and any velocity inherited from the parent
      from `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance`) by the following
      formula: `2 ^ (elapsedTime * -drag)`, where `elapsedTime` is the time
      since the particle was emit. Consequently, setting Drag to a negative
      value will cause particles' velocities to grow exponentially.

      Warning: if Drag is set to a sufficiently negative value, this can cause
      all particles emit by the emitter to completely disappear. Be careful when
      setting this property lower than -100.

      The EmissionDirection property determines the face (`Enum.NormalId`) of
      the parent object that particles emit from. By default, this is the top
      (+Y) direction. A negative `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed` means particles
      emit in the opposite direction. `Class.ParticleEmitter.SpreadAngle`
      further varies the emission direction. If you add a
      `Class.ParticleEmitter` to an `Class.Attachment`, which has a direction,
      you can rotate the Attachment itself (`Class.Attachment.Orientation`)
      instead of using this property.

      The Enabled property determines if particles emit from the emitter
      according to its `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rate`. Setting Enabled to false
      stops further particles from spawning, and any existing particles remain
      active until they expire. This property is useful when you have a pre-made
      particle effect that you want to remain disabled until you need it to emit
      particles.

      If you want no particles to render, you should call
      `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()` to clear any existing particles. You can
      use `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()` on disabled `Class.ParticleEmitter`s
      and they will still emit and render particles.

    description: |
      The `Class.ParticleEmitter.FlipbookMode|FlipbookMode` property determines
      the type of the flipbook animation. The property can be any value of the
      `Enum.ParticleFlipbookMode` enum:

      - **Loop** &ndash; Continuously play through all frames, starting back at
        the first frame after playing the last.
      - **OneShot** &ndash; Play through the animation only once across the
        particle's lifetime. With this setting, the
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.FlipbookFramerate` property doesn't apply;
        instead, the framerate is determined by the particle's
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` divided evenly by the number of frames
        in the animation. **OneShot** animations are useful for clear
        non-repeating animations, such as an explosion that creates a puff of
        smoke and then fades out.
      - **PingPong** &ndash; Play from the first to the last frame, then in
        reverse from the last to the first, repeating throughout the
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime` of the particle.
      - **Random** &ndash; Play the frames in a random order,
        blending/crossfading from one frame to the next. This can be useful for
        organic particle textures at low framerates, such as stars slowly
        twinkling between subtly different shapes.

    summary: |
      Defines a random range of ages for newly emitted particles.
    description: |
      The Lifetime property defines the maximum and minimum ages for newly
      emitted particles. When a particle emits, a random lifetime is chosen
      uniformly. Lifetimes are stored on a per-particle basis, so if this value
      is changed, existing particles will stay active until their randomly
      chosen lifetime is lived. The bounds for this property should be in the
      range [0, 20]. By default, `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters` will
      have a lifetime of 5 to 10 seconds. A lifetime of 0 will prevent particles
      from emitting at all.

      It's important to pick a sensible Lifetime and
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rate` so that you don't have too many particles
      being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick
      way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a
      balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit
      particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call
      `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()`.

    description: |
      The LightEmission property determines the blending of the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture`'s colors with the colors behind them. It
      should be set on the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 uses normal blending
      modes, and a value of 1 will use additive blending. The value of the
      additive blending is determined by this property. When changed, this
      property instantly affects all particles owned by the emitter, both
      current and future particles.

      When set to 1, only additive blending is used. As such, choosing a
      suitable `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture` is necessary. Below is an example
      texture that is suitable for such a ParticleEmitter.

      This property should not be confused with
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightInfluence`, which determines how particles are
      affected by environment light. This property does not cause particles to
      light the environment around them. To do that, consider using a
      `Class.PointLight`.

      0, particles are not influenced by light at all (they retain full
      brightness), and at 1 particles are fully influenced by light (in complete
      darkness, particles will be black).

      By default, this value is 1 if inserted with Studio tools. If inserted
      using `Datatype.Instance.new()`, it is 0.

      The Rate property determines how many particles are

    description: |
      The RotSpeed property determines a random range of angular speeds for

      so changing this property doesn't affect already active particles. This
      property, along with `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rotation`, affect the angle of
      the rendered particle image. This property is a `Datatype.NumberRange`
      measured in degrees per second.

      Particles with very high angular speeds can appear to rotate slower or not
      at all - this is because the angle of rotation is synchronized with the
      software render speed. In other words, if the particle is rotating at
      exactly 360 degrees every frame, there will be no apparent change in
      rotation.

    description: |
      The Rotation property determines the range of rotations in degrees for
      newly emitted particles. It is a `Datatype.NumberRange` measured in
      degrees. Positive values are in the clockwise direction. This property is
      often set to [0, 360] to provide a completely random rotation to new
      particles. `Class.ParticleEmitter.RotSpeed` also influences the rotation
      of a particle over its lifetime. This property is useful for correcting
      any `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture` that isn't at the desired orientation.

      Changes to this value only affect new particles; existing particles

    summary: |
      Influences particle emission from cylinder, disc, sphere, and box shapes.
    description: |
      Depending on the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Shape` value, this property
      performs a different action:

      - For cylinders, ShapePartial specifies the top radius proportion. A value
        of 0 means the top of the cylinder has a zero radius, making it a
        Christmas tree, and particles only emit from that single point. A value
        of 1 means the cylinder has no deformation and is regular cylinder.
      - For discs, ShapePartial specifies the inner radius proportion. A value
        of 0 means the disc is fully closed (a circle/ellipse), a value of 1
        means emission only occurs on the outer most rim of the disc, and values
        in-between emit from an annulus with a certain thickness.
      - For spheres, ShapePartial specifies the hemispherical angle that
        particles emit over. A value of 1 means particles emit from entire
        sphere, a value of 0.5 means particles emit from a half-dome, and a
        value of 0 means particles only emit from a single point at the north
        pole.
      - For boxes, ShapePartial specifies the extent to which the box becomes a
        frustum from its center point. For example, when the value is 1 it's a
        pyramidical shape from the box's center point.

    summary: |
      Determines the world size over individual particles' lifetimes.
    description: |
      The Size property determines the world size in studs of all active
      particles over their individual lifetimes. This property represents the
      dimensions of the square `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture` for each
      particle. It is a `Datatype.NumberSequence` that works similar to
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency` and `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color`.

      A particle's present size is determined by linearly interpolating on this
      NumberSequence using the particle's age and the particle's total lifetime.
      For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second
      lifetime, the size will be whatever is 50% of the way through the
      `Datatype.NumberSequence`. For any `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` with
      a nonzero envelope value, a random value in the envelope range is chosen
      for each keypoint for each particle when it spawns.

      Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the
      system. This is because the size of a particle is determined using its
      present lifetime and this NumberSequence (the Size at the time the
      particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

      #### Design Note

      When designing particle effects, size is probably the most important of
      all properties. Too large or too subtle can ruin a particle effect! The
      first thing you should do is decide how you want particles to enter and
      exit view - fade in/out, or grow/shrink from size 0? The choice is yours -
      start with a size NumberSequence from 0 to 3 or the reverse and go from
      there.

    description: |
      The Speed property determines a random range of speeds a new particle can
      have upon emission. It's measured in studs per second using a
      `Datatype.NumberRange`. The velocity is chosen upon emission, and applies
      in the `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection`. Negative speed values
      cause particles to travel in reverse.

      `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance`,
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Acceleration` and `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag`
      affect a particle's speed over its lifetime. Changing Speed doesn't affect
      active particles, and they retain whatever speed they have already.

    summary: |
      Determines the angles at which particles may be randomly emit, measured in

    description: |
      The SpreadAngle property determines the random angles that a particle may
      be emit. On emission, a random angle is selected uniformly using the range
      defined by SpreadAngle. For example, if the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection` is Top (+Y), then this
      `Datatype.Vector2` describes the size of the random angle spread on the
      X/Z axes, in degrees. The particle is given a velocity based on the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed` in the chosen direction.

      Setting one axis to 360 will cause particles to emit in all direction in a
      **circle**. Setting both to 360 will cause particles to emit in all
      directions in a **sphere**.

    summary: |
      Determines the transparency of particles over their individual lifetimes.
    description: |
      The Transparency property determines the transparency of all active
      particles over their individual lifetimes. It works similar to
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size` in how it affects particles over time. In
      terms of rendering, it works like the `Class.BasePart.Transparency` of a
      part on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is completely visible (opaque), and a
      value of 1 is completely invisible (not rendered at all).

      A particle's present transparency is determined by linearly interpolating
      on this NumberSequence using the particle's age and the particle's total
      lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4
      second lifetime, the transparency will be whatever is 50% of the way
      through the `Datatype.NumberSequence`. For any
      `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` with a nonzero envelope value, a random
      value in the envelope range is chosen for each keypoint for each particle
      when it spawns.

      Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the
      system. This is because the transparency of a particle is determined using
      its present lifetime and this `Datatype.NumberSequence` (the Transparency
      at the time the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

      The VelocityInheritance property determines how much of the parent part's

      A value of 0 means that no velocity is inherited, and a value of 1 means
      the particle will have the exact same speed as the parent
      `Class.BasePart`.

      When used in conjunction with `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag`, a particle
      emitter can make appear to be "shedding" particles from a moving part.

      particles, both current and future particles. Note that this property
      accepts fractional values; it is not like `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` (an
      integer)

      A practical use of ZOffset is for `ParticleEmitters` placed in players'
      characters: use it to define if particles should appear in front of or
      behind the character (use a value of +/- 2).

      Positive values will move particles closer to the camera, and negative
      values move particles away. Sufficiently negative values can cause
      particles to render inside or behind the parent part.
