  A special object that emits customizable 2D particles into the world.
description: |
  A **ParticleEmitter** is a special object that emits customizable 2D particles
  into the world. To emit and render particles, it must be parented to a
  `Class.BasePart` or an `Class.Attachment` within such a part. When parented to
  a `Class.BasePart`, particles spawn randomly within the part's bounding box or
  [shape](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md#shape); when parented to an
  `Class.Attachment`, particles spawn from the attachment's position.

  Particles emit automatically when the emitter is
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled|Enabled` with a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rate|Rate`, or manually when the
  `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()|Emit` method is called. With a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed`, particles are set in motion outwards
  and/or inwards, depending on the `Class.ParticleEmitter.ShapeInOut|ShapeInOut`
  property.

  By default, particles face the camera, but the
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Orientation|Orientation` can be modified to respect the
  particle velocity instead.

  During the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime` of the particles, they
  can change appearance according to the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color|Color` and
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size|Size`. Their motion can change over time according
  to the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag` and
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Acceleration|Acceleration` properties, and they can
  also move as their parent moves when they are
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.LockedToPart|LockedToPart` or have a non-zero
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance|VelocityInheritance`.

  To learn more about creating and customizing particle emitters, see
  [Particle Emitters](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md).

    summary: |
      Determines the global-axis acceleration of all active particles, measured

    description: |
      The **Acceleration** property determines how the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed` of particles changes over their
      lifetime. It is defined using a `Datatype.Vector3` to determine the
      acceleration on the global **X**/**Y**/**Z** axes and is measured in studs
      per second squared. When changed, this property affects all particles
      emitted by the emitter, both current and future.

      Acceleration will slow particles down if the vector points in the opposite
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection|EmissionDirection` in which they
      are emitted. Otherwise, it will speed them up.

    summary: |
      Determines the color of all active particles over their individual
      lifetimes.
    description: |
      The **Color** property determines the color of all active particles over
      their individual lifetimes. The color applies to the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture|Texture` when rendering and it uses the
      texture alpha along with the emitter's
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency|Transparency`. If an emitter has a
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightEmission|LightEmission` value that's greater
      than 0, darker colors make particles appear more transparent.

      Changing this property affects all particles emitted by the emitter, both
      current and future.

      When this property uses a gradient `Datatype.ColorSequence`, a particle's
      present color is determined by linearly interpolating on the sequence
      using the particle's age and its total lifetime. For example, if a
      particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the color will
      be whatever is 50% of the way through the `Datatype.ColorSequence`.

    description: |
      The **Drag** property determines the rate in seconds at which individual
      particles will lose half their speed via exponential decay. Drag is
      applied by scaling the expected velocity from
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed` and any velocity inherited from the
      parent from
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance|VelocityInheritance`. Setting
      this property to a negative value will cause particles' velocities to grow
      exponentially.

    description: |
      The **EmissionDirection** property determines the face (`Enum.NormalId`)
      of the parent object that particles emit from. A negative
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed` means particles emit in the opposite
      direction. `Class.ParticleEmitter.SpreadAngle|SpreadAngle` further varies
      the emission direction.

      If you add a `Class.ParticleEmitter` to an `Class.Attachment`, which has a
      direction, you can rotate the attachment itself
      (`Class.Attachment.Orientation`) instead of using this property.

      Setting this to `false` stops further particles from spawning, but any
      existing particles remain active until they expire. This property is
      useful when you have a pre-made particle effect that you want to remain
      disabled until you need it to emit particles.

      If you want to clear all particles from a disabled emitter, call
      `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()|Clear()`. Then, if desired, call
      `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()|Emit()` on the emitter to emit and render
      particles.

    description: |
      The **FlipbookMode** property determines the type of the flipbook
      animation. It can be any value of the `Enum.ParticleFlipbookMode` enum:

      - **Loop** &ndash; Continuously play through all frames, starting back at
        the first frame after playing the last.
      - **OneShot** &ndash; Play through the animation only once across the
        particle's lifetime. With this setting, the
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.FlipbookFramerate|FlipbookFramerate` property
        doesn't apply; instead, the framerate is determined by the particle's
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime` divided evenly by the number
        of frames in the animation. **OneShot** animations are useful for clear
        non-repeating animations, such as an explosion that creates a puff of
        smoke and then fades out.
      - **PingPong** &ndash; Play from the first to the last frame, then in
        reverse from the last to the first, repeating throughout the
        `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime|Lifetime` of the particle.
      - **Random** &ndash; Play the frames in a random order,
        blending/crossfading from one frame to the next. This can be useful for
        organic particle textures at low framerates, such as stars slowly
        twinkling between subtly different shapes.

      This property should not be confused with
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.LightInfluence|LightInfluence` which determines how
      particles are affected by environmental light.

      This property does **not** cause particles to light the environment around

      full brightness); at 1, particles are fully influenced by light (in
      complete darkness, particles will be black).

      By default, this value is 1 if inserted with Studio tools. If inserted

      move in lock step if the parent object moves.

      Alternatively, consider using the

      The **RotSpeed** property determines a random range of angular speeds for

      speed is chosen upon emission, so changing this property doesn't affect
      active particles. This property, along with
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Rotation|Rotation`, affects the angle of the
      rendered particle image.

      Particles with very high angular speeds can appear to rotate slower or not
      at all, since the angle of rotation is synchronized with the software
      render speed. For example, if particles rotate at exactly 360 degrees
      every frame, there will be no apparent change in rotation.

      Influences particle emission from cylinder, disc, sphere, and box shapes.
    description: |
      Depending on the `Class.ParticleEmitter.Shape|Shape` value, this property
      performs a different action:

      - For cylinders, it specifies the top radius proportion. A value of 0
        means the top of the cylinder has zero radius, making it a cone. A value
        of 1 means the cylinder has no deformation.

      - For discs, it specifies the inner radius proportion. A value of 0 means
        the disc is fully closed (circle/ellipse), while a value of 1 means
        emission only occurs on the outermost rim of the disc. Values between 0
        and 1 emit from an annulus with a certain thickness.

      - For spheres, it specifies the hemispherical angle over which particles
        emit. A value of 1 means particles emit from the entire sphere; a value
        of 0.5 means particles emit from a half-dome; a value of 0 means
        particles only emit from a single point at the north pole.

    summary: |
      Determines the world size over individual particles' lifetimes.
    description: |
      The **Size** property determines the world size of all active particles
      over their individual lifetimes. This property represents the dimensions
      of the square `Class.ParticleEmitter.Texture|Texture` for each particle.
      It is a `Datatype.NumberSequence` that works similarly to
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency|Transparency`.

      A particle's present size is determined by linearly interpolating on this
      sequence using the particle's age and its total lifetime. For example, if
      a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the size
      will be whatever is 50% of the way through the `Datatype.NumberSequence`.
      For any `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` with a non-zero envelope value,
      a random value in the envelope range is chosen for each keypoint for each
      particle when it emits.

    description: |
      The **Speed** property determines a random range of velocities (minimum to
      maximum) at which new particles will emit, measured in studs per second.
      Each particle's velocity is chosen upon emission and it applies in the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection|EmissionDirection`. Negative
      values cause particles to travel in reverse.

      Note that changing `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed|Speed` does not affect
      active particles and they retain whatever speed they already have.
      However, `Class.ParticleEmitter.Acceleration|Acceleration`,
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag`, and
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.VelocityInheritance|VelocityInheritance` can be
      used to affect the speed of active particles over their lifetime.

    description: |
      The **SpreadAngle** property determines the random angles at which a
      particle may be emitted. For example, if the
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.EmissionDirection|EmissionDirection` is **Top**
      (+**Y**), this `Datatype.Vector2` describes the size of the random angle
      spread on the **X**/**Z** axes, in degrees.

      Setting one axis to 360 will cause particles to emit in all direction in a
      **circle**. Setting both to 360 will cause particles to emit in all
      directions in a **sphere**.

    summary: |
      Determines the transparency of particles over their individual lifetimes.
    description: |
      The **Transparency** property determines the transparency of all active
      particles over their individual lifetimes. It works similar to
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size|Size` in how it affects particles over time.
      In terms of rendering, a value of 0 is completely visible (opaque) and a
      value of 1 is completely invisible (not rendered at all).

      A particle's present transparency is determined by linearly interpolating
      on this sequence using the particle's age and its total lifetime. For
      example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime,
      the transparency will be whatever is 50% of the way through the
      `Datatype.NumberSequence`. For any `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` with
      a non-zero envelope value, a random value in the envelope range is chosen
      for each keypoint for each particle when it emits.

    description: |
      The **VelocityInheritance** property determines how much of the parent
      part's `Class.BasePart.Velocity|Velocity` is inherited by particles when
      they are emitted. A value of 0 means that no velocity is inherited, while
      a value of 1 means the particle will have the exact same speed as the
      parent `Class.BasePart`.

      When used in conjunction with `Class.ParticleEmitter.Drag|Drag`, a
      particle emitter can appear to "shed" particles from a moving part.

      The **ZOffset** property determines the forward-backward render position

      changed, this property affects both current and future particles. Note
      that this property accepts fractional values; it is not like
      `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` (an integer).

      Positive values move particles closer to the camera and negative values
      move particles away. Sufficiently negative values can cause particles to
      render inside or behind the parent part.
