      This property determines the colorization to be applied to the
      `Class.ShirtGraphic` texture. It functions similarly to
      `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3` except that it is applied to
      `Class.ShirtGraphic` textures. This is useful for creating shirt graphics
      that have many different color variations but share the same basic look.

      See also:

      - `Class.Clothing.Color3` which determines the colorization to be applied
        to the `Class.Clothing` texture

      The content ID link pointing to the `Class.ShirtGraphic` texture hosted on
      the Roblox website. This property sets the texture associated with a
      t-shirt.

      #### Finding the ID

      This content ID is different than the website URL of the t-shirt. It can
      be found by pasting the website URL of the t-shirt into the **Graphic**
      property of the `Class.ShirtGraphic` in Roblox Studio, as Studio will
      correct it. Alternatively `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` can be used to
      insert the t-shirt into the workspace, for example:

      ```
      local webURL = "https://www.roblox.com/catalog/2591161/Sword-Fight-on-the-Heights-Ring-of-Fire-T-Shirt"
      local assetId = tonumber(string.match(webURL, "%d+") or 0)  -- Extract the number

      local success, model = pcall(function()
      	return game:GetService("InsertService"):LoadAsset(assetId)
      end)

      if success then
      	model.Parent = workspace
      end
      ```
