name: AnimationConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Aligns two `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` with an animate-able kinematic or
  force-based joint.
description: |
  An **AnimationConstraint** constrains its `Class.Attachment|Attachments` so
  that they're offset by the `Class.AnimationConstraint.Transform|Transform`
  `CFrame`. The `Class.AnimationConstraint.Transform|Transform` can be set
  manually during `Class.RunService.PreSimulation` or by an `Class.Animator`.

      When true, the connected parts follow the
      `Class.AnimationConstraint.Transform|Transform` perfectly without
      participating in physics simulation. When false, the connected parts
      follow the trajectory using forces and torques limited by
      `Class.AnimationConstraint.MaxForce` and
      `Class.AnimationConstraint.MaxTorque`.

    summary: |
      Describes the current animation offset of the `Class.AnimationConstraint`
      joint.
    description: |
      The internal `Datatype.CFrame` that is manipulated when a
      `Class.AnimationConstraint` is being animated.

      ##### Timing

      `Class.AnimationConstraint` transforms are not applied immediately, but
      rather as a batch in a parallel job after
      `Class.RunService.PreSimulation`, immediately before physics steps. The
      deferred batch update is much more efficient than many immediate updates.

      If the `Class.AnimationConstraint` is part of an animated model with an
      `Class.Animator`, then `Class.AnimationConstraint.Transform` is usually
      overwritten every frame by the `Class.Animator` after
      `Class.RunService.PreAnimation` and before
      `Class.RunService.PreSimulation`.
