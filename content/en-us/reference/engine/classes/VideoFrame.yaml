  A VideoFrame renders a rectangle, like a `Class.Frame` does, with a moving
  video image. The video must be from a file uploaded to the Roblox website.

  The video is scaled to fit the entirety of the rectangle, but looks best when
  displayed at its native resolution.

  ## 2D and 3D Sound

  A VideoFrame placed underneath `Class.SurfaceGui` on a `Class.BasePart` will
  emit its sound from that part's `Class.BasePart.Position`.

  A VideoFrame exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch
  varies with the relative motion of whatever part it is attached to.

  The volume of the VideoFrame will be determined by the distance between the
  client's sound listener (by default the `Class.Camera` position) and the
  position of the VideoFrame's part.

  A VideoFrame is considered **"global"** if it is not placed underneath
  SurfaceGui on a BasePart. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume
  throughout the entire place.
