summary: |
  A particle emitter with the visual aesthetic of smoke.
description: |
  Smoke is one of several particle-emitting classes. Like other particle
  emitters of its kind, Smoke objects emit particles when parented to a
  `Class.BasePart` (such as a `Class.Part`) or an `Class.Attachment` within such
  a `Class.BasePart`. Compared to the `Class.ParticleEmitter` class, Smoke lacks
  many different customization properties and special methods, such as
  `Class.ParticleEmitter.Lifetime` or `Class.ParticleEmitter:Emit()`. It is
  useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it
  is preferable to use a `Class.ParticleEmitter` instead.

  When `Class.Smoke.Enabled` is toggled off, particles emit by this object will
  continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Smoke object's
  `Class.Instance.Parent` is set to `nil` (and/or `Class.Instance:Destroy()`ed),
  all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try
  hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Smoke after
  a few seconds using `Class.Debris` to give the last particles a chance to
  expire. This object does not have a `Class.ParticleEmitter:Clear()` method,
  but it is possible to set the `Class.Instance.Parent` to `nil` and back to the
  exact same object for the same effect.

  Smoke particles are only emitted from the center of `Class.BasePart` to which
  they are parented. Parenting a Smoke object to an `Class.Attachment` instead
  allows customization of the particles' start position.

  - name: Smoke.Color
    summary: |
      Determines the color of the smoke particles.
    description: |
      The Color property determines the color of all the particles emit by a
      `Class.Smoke` object (both existing and future particles). It behaves
      similarly to `Class.ParticleEmitter.Color`, except that it is only one
      color and not a `Datatype.ColorSequence`. A color of white with some
      `Class.Smoke.Opacity` makes for a nice fog effect, and a very opaque black
      color can compliment a `Class.Fire` object nicely.

    summary: |
      Determines whether smoke particles emit.
    description: |
      The Enabled property, much like `Class.ParticleEmitter.Enabled`,
      determines whether smoke particles are emitted. Any particles already emit
      will continue to render until their lifetime expires. This property is
      useful for keeping pre-made smoke effects off until they are needed later.
      Since smoke particles are destroyed when the `Class.Smoke` object's
      `Class.Instance.Parent` is set to `nil`, this property is useful in
      allowing existing particles the opportunity to expire before destroying
      the Fire object altogether. See the function below.

      ```
      local Debris = game:GetService("Debris")
      local part = script.Parent
      function stopSmoke(smoke)
      	smoke.Enabled = false -- No more new particles
      	Debris:AddItem(smoke, 10) -- Remove the object after a delay (after existing particles have expired)
      end
      stopSmoke(part.Smoke)
      ```

    summary: |
      Determines how opaque smoke particles render.
    description: |
      Opacity determines the opaqueness of the smoke particles. It must be in
      the range [0, 1]. This property works **inversely** in comparison to a
      part's `Class.BasePart.Transparency` or ParticleEmitter's
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Transparency`: a value of 0 is completely
      invisible, 1 is completely visible.

      The texture that Roblox uses for `Class.Smoke` particles is partially
      transparent, so setting this property to 1 still yields transparency in
      rendered smoke.

  - name: Smoke.RiseVelocity
    summary: |
      Determines the velocity of the smoke particles.
    description: |
      RiseVelocity behaves similarly to `Class.ParticleEmitter.Speed` and
      `Class.Fire.Heat`: it determines how fast the smoke particles move during
      their lifetime. It must be in the range [-25, 25]. Negative values will
      cause particles to emit in the bottom (-Y) direction of the parent
      `Class.BasePart`.

      When using a `Class.Smoke` effect to create fog, set this property to 0.
      For large smoke effects, make the rise subtle (2 to 8). For chimneys and
      smokestacks, higher values are appropriate.

    summary: |
      Determines the size of newly emit smoke particles.
    description: |
      The Size property of `Class.Smoke` determines the size of the newly emit
      smoke particles. Unlike `Class.Smoke.Color`, this property will not change
      the size of existing particles. It must be in the range [0.1, 100]. Unlike
      `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size`, this property is only a number (not a
      `Datatype.NumberSequence`). Also note also that the size of the particles
      is not 1-to-1 with studs; in fact, the size of the smoke particle is more
      than twice as large. At the largest size, smoke particles can render
      larger than 200 studs wide!

      A value between 0-1 than controls the speed of the particle effect. At 1
      it runs at normal speed, at 0.5 it runs at half speed, and at 0 it freezes
      time.
