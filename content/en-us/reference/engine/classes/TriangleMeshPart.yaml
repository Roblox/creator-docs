  Abstract intermediate class that manages physical geometry properties for
  PartOperations and MeshParts.
description: |
  TriangleMeshPart is an abstract intermediate class from which `Class.MeshPart`
  and `Class.PartOperation` inherit. It was created to consolidate the
  management of physical geometry properties between the two sub-classes. It
  implements the read-only
  `Class.TriangleMeshPart.CollisionFidelity|CollisionFidelity`.

properties:
  - name: TriangleMeshPart.CollisionFidelity
    summary: |
      Determines the level of detail the part's physics will adhere to its mesh.
    description: |
      This property determines how the collision model of the
      `Class.TriangleMeshPart` relates to the actual geometry of the mesh. This
      property cannot be read or manipulated by scripts during runtime.

      See [here](../../../workspace/collisions.md#collision-fidelity) for a
      visual representation of the various options.
