  Controls the volume of incoming audio across three frequency ranges.
description: |
  An equalizer allows for control of the volume of various frequency ranges for
  the `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` the effect is parented to. This can be
  used to highlight particular elements of audio or minimize or outright
  eliminate others. The `Class.EqualizerSoundEffect` gives control over three
  ranges of frequency: Low, Mid, and High. Their specific frequencies are as
  follows:

  - Low: 0 - 400 Hz
  - Mid: 400 - 4000 Hz
  - High: 4000+ Hz
