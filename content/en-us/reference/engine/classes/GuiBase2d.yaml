    summary: |
      Describes the actual screen position of a `Class.GuiBase2d` element, in
      pixels.
    description: |
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition|AbsolutePosition` is a read-only
      property that provides the screen position of a `Class.GuiBase2d` element
      in pixels. This represents the actual pixel position at which an element
      renders as a result of its ancestors' sizes and positions. Note that
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition|AbsolutePosition` always represents the
      top-left corner of the `Class.GuiBase2d` element.

      If the `Class.GuiBase2d` is in a `Class.ScreenGui`, the
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition|AbsolutePosition` property uses the
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets` viewport coordinate system. The
      origin of this coordinate system is located at the bottom-left corner of
      the Roblox top bar. Note that this is the same coordinate system used by
      the `Class.InputObject.Position` property.

      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteRotation|AbsoluteRotation` is a read-only
      property that describes the actual screen rotation of a `Class.GuiBase2d`

      may not be in the range `0` to `360`.

      A reference to a `Class.LocalizationTable` to be used to apply automated
      localization to this `Class.GuiBase2d` and its descendants.
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AutoLocalize|AutoLocalize` must be set to `true` on the
      `Class.GuiBase2d` and its ancestors for automated localization to be
      applied.

      You can set this to reference a `Class.LocalizationTable` anywhere in the
      `Class.DataModel`. The `Class.GuiBase2d` object and all of its children
      will try to use that specific `Class.LocalizationTable` and its ancestors
      for automatic text replacement before using the tables under
      `Class.LocalizationService` in an undefined order and the cloud table.

      If there is no translation available in the referenced table, it will look
      for a translation in the parent of that table, if it is also a
      `Class.LocalizationTable`, and so on.

      See also `Class.LocalizationService:GetTableEntries()` which explains how
      the `Class.GuiBase2d.RootLocalizationTable|RootLocalizationTable` is used
      for automated localization.

    description: |
      Allows for customization of how gamepad selection can move between
      buttons, which are descendants of the selection group, leave the group,
      and select other buttons.

      Setting `Class.GuiBase2d.SelectionGroup|SelectionGroup` to `true` exposes
      the `Class.GuiBase2d.SelectionBehaviorUp|SelectionBehaviorUp`,
      `Class.GuiBase2d.SelectionBehaviorDown|SelectionBehaviorDown`,
      `Class.GuiBase2d.SelectionBehaviorLeft|SelectionBehaviorLeft`, and
      `Class.GuiBase2d.SelectionBehaviorRight|SelectionBehaviorRight`
      properties. For these selection behaviors, a setting of
      `Enum.SelectionBehavior.Escape` (default) means the gamepad selection
      tries to first find a selection within the selection group and only moves
      outside if it does not find a suitable button. Alternatively, a setting of
      `Enum.SelectionBehavior.Stop` means gamepad selection only looks within
      the selection group and does not move outside of the group from the
      selection behavior direction.
