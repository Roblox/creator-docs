  An Explosion applies force to `BaseParts|BasePart` within the explosion's
  `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`. This force breaks
  `Class.JointInstance|JointInstances` and
  `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints` between parts and kills
  `Class.Humanoid` characters not protected by a `Class.ForceField`.
  `Class.Constraint|Constraints` will not be broken by an explosion.

  If an explosion is instanced while the game is running, it will destroy itself
  shortly afterwards, so they do not need to be cleaned up using the
  `Class.Debris` service.

  **Explosion effects**

  `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` are killed by explosions as they break the
  character `Class.Model` neck joint. Parenting a `Class.ForceField` to a model
  will protect all of its children from Explosions. This means that their joints
  will not be broken and thus `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` will not be killed.

  If a developer doesn't want joints between `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` to be
  broken or wants to implement their own formula for damaging
  `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` it is recommended they set
  `Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent` to 0 and use the
  `Class.Explosion.Hit` event to handle the result of the explosion.

  Explosions can also be configured to damage `Class.Terrain`, creating craters,
  this behavior is controlled by the
  `Class.Explosion.ExplosionType|ExplosionType` property.

  The effect of an Explosion is not disrupted by obstacles, this means parts
  shielded behind other parts will still be affected, even if the
  `Class.BasePart` they are shielded behind is not anchored.

      Used to determine the amount of force applied to
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` caught in the `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`.

      Currently this level of force applied does not vary based on distance from
      `Class.Explosion.Position`. Unanchored `BaseParts` will accelerate equally
      away from the origin regardless of distance provided they are within the
      blast radius.

      The blast pressure determines the acceleration of parts due to an
      explosion. It does not determine the degree to which joints are broken.
      When `Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent` is equal to 1 all joints
      between parts in the `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius` will be destroyed
      provided BlastPressure is greater than 0.

      The BlastPressure also does not determine the amount of damage given to
      `Class.Terrain`. Provided BlastPressure is greater than 0 and
      `Class.Explosion.ExplosionType` isn't set to Enum.ExplosionType.NoCraters
      the size of the crater created is determined exclusively by the
      `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`.

      Setting BlastPressure to 0 eliminates the effect of the explosion and is
      useful when developers want to program their own custom behavior for
      explosions using the `Class.Explosion.Hit` event.

      This property determines the radius of the `Class.Explosion`, in studs.
      This property accepts any value between 0 and 100.

      This radius determines the area of effect of the Explosion, not the size
      of the Explosion's visuals. The size of the Explosion's visual effect is
      the same regardless of BlastRadius (even if BlastRadius is 0).

      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` within the BlastRadius will be affected by the
      explosion. Meaning, if `Class.Explosion.BlastPressure` is greater than 0,
      force will be applied to parts. The degree to which joints are broken
      within the BlastRadius depends on
      `Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent`. `Class.Explosion.Hit` will
      fire for any every `Class.BasePart` within the radius.

      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are considered within
      `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius` even if they are only partially in range.

      Used to set the proportion of the `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`, between 0

      and 1, within which all joints will be destroyed. Anything outside of this
      range will only have the `Class.Explosion` force applied to it.

      For example, if `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius` is set to 100 and
      DestroyJointRadiusPercent is set to 0.5, any joints within a radius of 50
      studs would be broken. Any joints between the ranges of 50 and 100 studs
      wouldn't be destroyed, but the `Class.Explosion` force would still be
      applied to the `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`.

      This property allows developers to make `Class.Explosion|Explosions`
      'non-lethal' to `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` by setting
      DestroyJointRadiusPercent to 0. This means the neck joint will not be
      broken when characters come into contact with the `Class.Explosion`.

      This property determines how the `Class.Explosion` will interact with
      `Class.Terrain`. It is an Enum.ExplosionType value and can be set to one
      of three options.

      - **NoCraters** - Explosions will not damage Terrain
      - **Craters** - Explosions will create craters in Terrain
      - **CratersAndDebris** - Redundant, behaves the same as Craters

      If ExplosionType is set to create craters in `Class.Terrain`, the radius
      of the crater will be roughly equal to the `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`.
      Craters are created in all `Class.Terrain` materials other than water. The
      size of the crater is not influenced by the material, although some
      materials create rougher edges than others.

      This property is the position of the center of the `Class.Explosion`. It
      is defined in world-space and not influenced by the `Class.Explosion`
      parent.

      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` will be influenced by the `Class.Explosion` if
      they are within `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius` studs of the explosion's
      position.

      The effect of an explosion is instantaneous. This means that although the
      position of an explosion can be changed after it has been set it cannot
      affect two different areas. Once an explosion has been 'detonated',
      shortly after parenting it to a descendant of the `Class.Workspace`, it
      will not do so again. In some cases the visual effect of the explosion
      will move but it will have no effect.

      For this reason a new Explosion should be created if the developer wants
      an explosion to appear at a different position.

      This property determines whether or not the visual effect of an

      When Visible is set to false, the explosion will still affect
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` in its `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`, the only
      difference is it will not be seen.

      One use for this property would be for a developer to make their own
      custom explosion effects using a `Class.ParticleEmitter`, while retaining
      the default `Class.Explosion` functionality.

      Fires when the `Class.Explosion` hits a `Class.BasePart` within its
      `Class.Explosion.BlastRadius`. Returns the part hit along with the
      distance of the part from `Class.Explosion.Position`.

      Note that the effect of an `Class.Explosion` is not disrupted by
      obstacles, this means parts shielded behind other parts will still be hit,
      even if the `Class.BasePart` they are shielded behind is anchored.

      This event will also fire when `Class.Explosion.BlastPressure` is equal to
      zero. This means developers can program their own custom behavior for
      explosions by eliminating the explosion's influence on
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and `Class.Terrain`.

      Note that this event will fire for every `Class.BasePart` hit. This means
      it can fire multiple times for the same player character (as the character
      `Class.Model` is made up of multiple parts). For this reason when dealing
      custom damage using the `Class.Explosion.Hit` event it's recommended to
      implement a check to see if the character has already been hit by the
      `Class.Explosion`.
