  A FloorWire attempts to make a wire from two of its properties:
  `Class.FloorWire.From` and `Class.FloorWire.To`, which both need to be set to
  a `Class.BasePart`. It sometimes goes through bricks but the majority of the
  time it works fine. It starts at From's center and goes to To's center. Which
  side of each one it goes into depends on the BaseParts's positions. It chooses
  the fastest route.
