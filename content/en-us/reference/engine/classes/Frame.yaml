description: |
  Frame is a `Class.GuiObject` that renders as a plain rectangle with no other
  content. They are the simplest concrete example of a `Class.GuiObject`, as
  they provide very little additional functionality (`Class.Frame.FrameStyle`).
  Despite this, Frames are useful as containers for other `Class.GuiObject`s,
  such as `Class.TextLabel`, `Class.ImageLabel`. The key benefit to using a
  Frame over a `Class.Folder` as a container object is the ability to further
  manipulate the `Class.GuiObject.Size` and `Class.GuiObject.Position` of any
  descendant `Class.GuiObject`s.
