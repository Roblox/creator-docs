  `Class.Frame` is a `Class.GuiObject` that acts as a container for other
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`. You can use it for UI that either displays on a
  user's [screen](../../../ui/on-screen-containers.md) or on a
  [surface](../../../ui/in-experience-containers.md) within the experience.

  When you manipulate frames, you also manipulate the
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` they contain. For example, if you change the
  position of a `Class.Frame` object with a child `Class.TextLabel`, you also
  change the position of that label. In addition, all frames are also
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`, so you can customize their properties, such as
  `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3`,
  `Class.GuiObject.BorderMode|BorderMode`,
  `Class.GuiObject.Transparency|Transparency`, and
  `Class.GuiObject.Rotation|Rotation`, to fit the aesthetics of your experience.
