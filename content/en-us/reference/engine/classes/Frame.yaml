description: |
  Frame is a `Class.GuiObject` that renders as a plain rectangle with no other
  content. They are the simplest concrete example of a `Class.GuiObject`, as
  they provide very little additional functionality (`Class.Frame.FrameStyle`).
  Despite this, Frames are useful as containers for other
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`, such as `Class.TextLabel`, `Class.ImageLabel`.
  The key benefit to using a Frame over a `Class.Folder` as a container object
  is the ability to further manipulate the `Class.GuiObject.Size` and
  `Class.GuiObject.Position` of any descendant `Class.GuiObject`s.
