name: Frame
type: class
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  A `Class.GuiObject` that renders as a plain rectangle, generally used as a
  container.
description: |
  `Class.Frame` is a `Class.GuiObject` that acts as a container for other
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`. You can use it for UI that either displays on a
  user's [screen](../../../ui/on-screen-containers.md) or on a
  [surface](../../../ui/in-experience-containers.md) within the experience.

  `Class.Frame|Frames` are ideal containers for responsive layouts such as
  [list and flex layouts](../../../ui/list-flex-layouts.md), allowing you to
  change the size of the frame and dynamically adjust how layout items fit
  within it. `Class.Frame|Frames` are also core `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`, so
  you can customize properties such as
  `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3`,
  `Class.GuiObject.Transparency|Transparency`, apply a
  [background gradient](../../../ui/appearance-modifiers.md#gradient) or
  [border](../../../ui/appearance-modifiers.md#stroke), and more.
