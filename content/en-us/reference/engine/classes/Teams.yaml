  Teams offer a range of features that are useful to developers. These can
  broadly be divided into features that work out-of-the-box and features
  developers can program into their game.

  **Built-in team behavior** The following functionality of Teams exists by
  default and does not require the developer to program any custom behavior.

  - When part of a Team, the name above a player's character `Class.Model` will
    be colored to the `Class.Team.TeamColor`
  - Changing `Class.Player.TeamColor` will cause `Class.Player.Team` switch to
    the Team with the corresponding `Class.Team.TeamColor`
  - When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed by
    team
  - Setting `Class.Player.Neutral` to true will cause the `Class.Player` to be
    dis-associated with the team, but will not change `Class.Player.Team` or
    `Class.Player.TeamColor`
  - When a `Class.Player` joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with
    `Class.Team.AutoAssignable` set to true that has the fewest players. If no
    auto assignable team is available, `Class.Player.Neutral` will be set to
    true
  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` is set to false, only players whose
    `Class.Player.TeamColor` matches `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` can spawn
    on that `Class.SpawnLocation`
  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` is set to true, a player's
    `Class.Player.TeamColor` will change to `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` when
    their character touches the `Class.SpawnLocation`

  **Optional extended team behavior** Many developers chose to add the following
  features to teams in their own code.

  - Implement checks for team in weapon code to prevent team killing
  - Implement doors or other features that only certain teams can use
  - Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance

      Returns a table containing the game's `Class.Team` objects. Will only
      return `Class.Team` objects that are parented to the `Class.Teams`
      service.

      The GetTeam function returns a table containing the game's `Class.Team`
      objects.

      Note this will only return Team objects that are directly parented to the
      `Class.Teams` service. For this reason it is recommended developers only
      parent `Class.Team` objects to the `Class.Teams` service and not to other
      `Class.Instance|Instances` (or to each other).
