  SoundEffect is the base class that all other sound effects derive from. A
  SoundEffect can be applied to either a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by
  being parented to either. Multiple effects can be applied to the same Sound or
  SoundGroup. The order the effects will be applied in is determined by that
  effect's Priority.

      Determines the order the effect will be applied in relation to other
      effects. Higher priority effects will be applied earlier. The exception
      is when Priority equals 0 (which is the default). In this case, the base
      priority for the effect will be used. If the priority of two effects are
      equal, then the order is undetermined.
