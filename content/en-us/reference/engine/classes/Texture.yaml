  Applies a repeating image texture to the face of a parent `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  A `Class.Texture` object applies a repeating image texture to the face of a
  parent `Class.BasePart`. The affected face is dependent on the
  `Class.Texture.Face|Face` property. Unlike `Class.Decal|Decals`, the texture
  applied by a `Class.Texture` will repeat when the parent `Class.BasePart` is
  resized, with the size of the repeating textures determined by the
  `Class.Texture.StudsPerTileU|StudsPerTileU` and
  `Class.Texture.StudsPerTileV|StudsPerTileV` properties.

  The applied image texture is determined by its
  `Class.Texture.ColorMapContent|ColorMapContent` property. For details on how
  to upload images, see
  [asset management](../../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-management).

  For more information, review
  [textures and decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md). See also:

  - `Class.Decal` for non-repeating surface images.
  - `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent` to apply an image texture to a
    `Class.MeshPart`.
  - `Class.SurfaceGui` to apply an `Class.ImageLabel` or `Class.ImageButton` to
    an in-experience 3D object.

      This property determines how far the rendered texture is offset on the
      horizontal axis, in studs, as visualized
      [here](../../../parts/textures-decals.md#offset-textures).

      Sets the horizontal size, in studs, of the tiled image applied by the

      Sets the horizontal size, in studs, of the tiled image applied by the
      `Class.Texture`.

      Larger values for this property will lead to the `Class.Texture` appearing
      larger, and repeating less frequently. Unlike with `Class.Decal|Decals`,
      the size of the repeated image is unaffected by the dimensions of the
      `Class.BasePart`. Instead, resizing the `Class.BasePart` only increases
      the number of times the texture repeats.

      Note that this property can be set to very low values, but not zero. Also
      note that the horizontal/vertical distinction is relative to the parent
      `Class.BasePart` axis; therefore the `Class.Texture` will rotate along
      with the `Class.BasePart`.
