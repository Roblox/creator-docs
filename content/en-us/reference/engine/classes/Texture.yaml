  A Texture object applies a repeating texture to the face of a
  `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  A `Class.Texture` object applies a repeating image texture to the face of a
  `Class.BasePart`. Which face the image is applied to is dependent on the
  `Class.FaceInstance.Face` property.

  Unlike `Class.Decal|Decals`, the image applied by a `Class.Texture` will
  repeat when the `Class.BasePart` is resized. The size of the repeating
  textures is determined by the `Class.Texture.StudsPerTileU|StudsPerTileU` and
  `Class.Texture.StudsPerTileV|StudsPerTileV` properties.

  The applied image is determined by the `Class.Decal.Texture|Texture` property.
  For information on how to upload images, see
  [Assets](../../../projects/assets/index.md).

  See also `Class.Decal` for non-repeating surface images, and
  `Class.SurfaceGui` to apply UI elements to in‑experience
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`.

      Larger values for this property will lead to the `Class.Texture` appearing
      larger, and repeating less frequently. Unlike with `Class.Decal|Decals`,
      the size of the repeated image is unaffected by the dimensions of the
      `Class.BasePart`. Instead, resizing the `Class.BasePart` only increases
      the number of times the texture repeats.

      Note that this property can be set to very low values, but not zero. Also
      note that the horizontal/vertical distinction is relative to the parent
      `Class.BasePart` axis; therefore the `Class.Texture` will rotate along
      with the `Class.BasePart`.
