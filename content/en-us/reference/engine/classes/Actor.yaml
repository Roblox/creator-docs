  An `Class.Actor` is a container for code that can be safely split into its own
  thread using `Library.task.desynchronize()`. It should also contain the
  instances used by its scripts.

  To learn more about using multiple Actors to optimize script performance, see
  [Parallel Luau](../../../scripting/multithreading.md).

      Binds a Luau callback to a message with the specified topic.
    description: |
      This method is used to bind a Luau callback to a message with the
      specified topic. When a message is sent (using
      `Class.Actor:SendMessage()|SendMessage()`) to the topic specified the
      provided callback will be called in a _serial_ execution context.

      Multiple Luau callbacks may be bound to a single actor and even to a
      single message topic.

      Note: Only the scripts which are descendants of an Actor may bind to its
      messages.

      ```lua
      local actor = script:GetActor()

      -- Print out a message when a greeting message is sent to the Actor
      -- this script is a descendant of.
      local connection = actor:BindToMessage("Greeting", function(message)
        print("Received Greeting Message:", message)
      end)
      ```

    summary: |
      Sends a message to an Actor.
    description: |
      Sends a message to an Actor. Messages are sent asynchronously, so the
      sender will not block or yield when calling the
      `Class.Actor:SendMessage()|SendMessage()` method.

      Since a single Actor may receive different kinds of messages, a `topic`
      parameter is used to distinguish between various kinds of messages.

      See `Class.Actor:BindToMessage()|BindToMessage()` for details on receiving
      a message sent using `Class.Actor:SendMessage()|SendMessage()`.

      ```lua
      -- Assume `actor` is a local variable referring to an Actor instance
      actor:SendMessage("Greeting", "Hello World")
      ```
    code_samples: []

      - name: topic

      - name: message

          The contents of the message to send to the Actor.
