name: PrismaticConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Constraint which creates a rigid joint between two
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, allowing them to slide along one axis but not
  rotate.
description: |
  A **PrismaticConstraint** creates a rigid joint between two
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, allowing them to slide along one axis but not
  rotate. This constrains the attachments so that their **X** axes are collinear
  but pointing in opposite directions. It also constrains the attachments so
  that their **Y** axes are parallel.

  This constraint inherits many properties from `Class.SlidingBallConstraint`
  including `Class.SlidingBallConstraint.ActuatorType|ActuatorType`,
  `Class.SlidingBallConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled`,
  `Class.SlidingBallConstraint.Velocity|Velocity`, and more. Please refer to
  `Class.SlidingBallConstraint` for details on configuring a
  `Class.PrismaticConstraint`.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.
