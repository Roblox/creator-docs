name: DistortionSoundEffect
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Distorts audio, making it sound fuzzier and overdriven.
description: |
  A distortion effect is used to simulate the effect that would occur when
  overdriving older style audio equipment (such as vacuum tubes). This effect
  causes clipping in the sound and adds a general "fuzziness".

  Like all other `Class.SoundEffect`, a DistortionSoundEffect can be applied
  either to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
