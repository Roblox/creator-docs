  Links a `Class.StyleSheet` to the instance tree whose root is the parent of
  the `StyleLink`. For example, placing a `StyleLink` under a `Class.ScreenGui`
  applies the referenced `Class.StyleSheet` to both the `Class.ScreenGui` and
  all of the `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` within it. Only one `Class.StyleSheet`
  can apply to a given tree.
