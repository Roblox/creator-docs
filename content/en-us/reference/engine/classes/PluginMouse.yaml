  The PluginMouse object gives `Class.Plugin|Plugins` access to the mouse. It
  works like the `Class.Mouse` object and can be obtained using the plugin
  `Class.Plugin:GetMouse()` method.

  Note the PluginMouse can only be used when the plugin has been activated using
  `Class.Plugin:Activate()`.

  In addition to the functions from the `Class.Mouse` object, the PluginMouse
  includes the `Class.PluginMouse.DragEnter` function which keeps track of items
  being selected while the mouse is dragging.

  For more information on how to use mouse objects, see the `Class.Mouse` page.
