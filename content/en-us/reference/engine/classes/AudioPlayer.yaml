      A range, in seconds, denoting a desired loop start and loop end within the
      `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` of this
      `Class.AudioPlayer`.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` minimum is **greater**
      than the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` minimum, the
      loop starts from the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` minimum.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` minimum is **less** than
      the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` minimum, the loop
      starts from the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` minimum.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` maximum is **greater**
      than the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` maximum, the
      loop ends at the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion`
      maximum.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` maximum is **less** than
      the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` maximum, the loop
      ends at exactly the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` maximum.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` minimum **equals** the
      `Class.AudioPlayer.LoopRegion|LoopRegion` maximum, the `Class.AudioPlayer`
      uses the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` property
      instead.

      If the `Class.AudioPlayer.PlaybackRegion|PlaybackRegion` maximum is
