  Allows animations to be loaded and applied to a character or model in place of
  a `Class.Humanoid`.
description: |
  An object which allows animations to be loaded and applied to a character or
  model in place of a `Class.Humanoid`. Creates an `Class.Animator` and loads
  animations to update `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` of said character to react in
  the way that is described within the animation asset referenced by an
  `Class.Animation` object.

  Note that the `Class.AnimationController:LoadAnimation()|LoadAnimation()`
  method of this class has been deprecated. Instead, you should call
  `Class.Animator:LoadAnimation()` directly from an `Class.Animator` which can
  be created manually in Studio and directly referenced in scripts. When the
  deprecated method is called from an `Class.AnimationController`, the
  controller itself does nothing regarding the animation intended to be loaded,
  except to automatically generate an `Class.Animator`, onto which the loading
  call and animation ID are transferred. In this way, the
  `Class.AnimationController` can be thought of as nothing more than an empty
  shell for a child `Class.Animator` object which handles any actual
  functionality regarding animations.

      Returns an array of all `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are

      Returns an array of all `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` that are
      currently being played by the `Class.AnimationController`.

      A typical use for this function is stopping currently playing tracks using
      `Class.AnimationTrack:Stop()`.

      Note this function will not return `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks`
      that have loaded but are not playing. If the developer wishes to track
      these they will need to index them manually. See below for one example of
      how this could be achieved:

      ```
      local animationTracks = {}
      local track = animationController:LoadTrack(animation)
      table.insert(animationTracks, track)
      ```

    description: |
      This event fires whenever the `Class.AnimationController` begins playing
      an animation. It returns the `Class.AnimationTrack` playing.

      The `Class.AnimationTrack` can be used to access the animation's playback
      functions and events. It will only fire for animations playing on the
      specific `Class.AnimationController`.

      See `Class.Humanoid.AnimationPlayed` for the `Class.Humanoid` variant of
      this function.
