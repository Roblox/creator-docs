summary: |
  Applies a blur to the entire game world.
description: |
  The **BlurEffect** applies a Gaussian blur to the entire rendered game world.
  The strength of the blur is controlled by the `Class.BlurEffect.Size`. Only
  one **BlurEffect** can be applied at once (the instance with the greatest
  `Class.BlurEffect.Size|Size` takes priority).

  Like other post-processing effects, **BlurEffect** will only work while
  `Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled` and when parented to `Class.Lighting` or
  `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. Also, it may render differently on low-end
  devices and/or depending on your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level**
  settings in **Rendering** &rarr; **Performance**).

  For more details on this effect and others, see
  [Post-Processing Effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md).

      the blurrier the screen will become.
