name: RayValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a single Ray.
description: |
  A RayValue is an object whose purpose is to store a single Ray. Similar to
  CFrameValue, a RayValue's stored ray cannot be viewed or edited within the
  Properties window within studio. Instead, use the Command bar to get and set
  the value of these objects. For example, you can use a line like the one below
  to create a new RayValue named "Value" within the `Class.Workspace`. It
  creates a ray at (0, 50, 0) and it faces in the positive-X direction.

  `Instance.new("RayValue").Value = Ray.new(Vector3.new(0, 50, 0), Vector3.new(10, 0, 0))`

  Since there is no trivial way to edit rays within Studio, sometimes it is
  better to use a CFrameValue instead (which can be changed through a part or
  the camera). You can reconstruct a ray from a CFrame using
  `Ray.new(cf.p, cf.lookVector * dist)`, where `cf` is a given CFrame and `dist`
  is the length of the Ray you want to construct.

  Like all "-Value" objects, this single value is stored in the Value property.
  The Changed event for this (and other objects like it) will fire with the new
  value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

    summary: |
      Fired when `Class.RayValue.Value` is changed.
    description: |
      This event fires whenever the `Class.RayValue.Value` property is changed.
      It will run with the new value being stored in the argument object,
      instead of a string representing the property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      RayValue changes and to track the different values that it may change to.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
