description: |
  A SurfaceLight is a light source that emits illumination of a specified
  `Class.Light.Color` and `Class.Light.Brightness` from a
  `Class.SurfaceLight.Face` for a specified `Class.SurfaceLight.Range`.

  In order for a SurfaceLight to provide illumination, it must be the direct
  child of a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` (the part or attachment
  itself must be a descendant of the Workspace). If a SurfaceLight is parented
  to a part, then the light will emanate from the part's selected face(s). If
  parented to an attachment SurfaceLight is equivalent to a `Class.SpotLight`.

  For more light types, please see the **see also** section.
