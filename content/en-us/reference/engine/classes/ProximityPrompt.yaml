description: |
  The **ProximityPrompt** instance lets you prompt players to interact with an
  object in the 3D world, such as opening a door or picking up an item. A
  `Class.ProximityPrompt` object works when parented to a `Class.BasePart`,
  `Class.Attachment`, or `Class.Model` (with
  `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart` set) in the workspace. When the player's
  character approaches, a UI appears to prompt them for input.

  Prompts consist of three primary elements, each of which can be controlled by
  the noted properties. The default UI can be swapped out for your own custom
  appearance as outlined in `Class.ProximityPrompt.Style|Style`.

  You can connect to proximity prompt events either on the
  `Class.ProximityPrompt` object itself or globally through
  `Class.ProximityPromptService`. The `Class.ProximityPromptService` allows you
  to manage all proximity prompt behavior from one location, preventing any need
  for duplicate code in your experience.

  For more information regarding proximity prompts, see the
  [Proximity Prompts](../../../ui/proximity-prompts.md) guide.

      This property serves as a reference to the `Class.LocalizationTable` used

      In order for this to apply, `Class.ProximityPrompt.AutoLocalize` must be
      set.

      Developers can set this to reference a LocalizationTable anywhere in the
      `Class.DataModel`. It is not required to be a child of
      `Class.LocalizationService`. If there is no translation available in the
      referenced table it will look for a translation in the parent of that
      table, if it is also a LocalizationTable, and so on.

      The provided UI can be swapped out for a custom UI. In order to do this,
      set Style to Custom. Then, listen to the
      `Class.ProximityPrompt.PromptShown` and
      `Class.ProximityPrompt.PromptHidden` events in a `Class.LocalScript`,
      where developers should create and tear down the UI.

      Developers may also use `Class.ProximityPrompt.PromptButtonHoldBegan` and
      `Class.ProximityPrompt.PromptButtonHoldEnded` in order to utilize the
      `Class.ProximityPrompt.HoldDuration` progress animation feature.
