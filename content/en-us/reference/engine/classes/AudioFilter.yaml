  Adjusts the frequency content of audio streams.
description: |
  `Class.AudioFilter` adjusts the frequency content of audio streams. It
  provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be connected
  to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`. `Class.AudioFilter` uses its
  `Class.AudioFilter.FilterType|FilterType`, `Class.AudioFilter.Gain|Gain`, and
  `Class.AudioFilter.Q|Q` properties to determine what to do around a particular
  cutoff `Class.AudioFilter.Frequency|Frequency`.

      The central frequency in hertz of the curve represented by the filter.
      Generally, adjusting this value up or down corresponds to a horizontal
      shift in the overall frequency curve. Ranges from 20 to 22000.

    description: |
      The gain value in decibels used to determine the volume level of the curve
      represented by the filter. Only applies when the
      `Class.AudioFilter|FilterType` is `Peak`, `LowShelf`, or `HighShelf`.

    summary: |
      For peaking, lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch filters, controls the
      selectiveness or resonance.
    description: |
      The quality value used to determine the slope or resonance of the curve
      represented by the filter. Only applies when the
      `Class.AudioFilter|FilterType` is `Peak`, `Lowpass[x]dB`, `Highpass[x]dB`,
      `Bandpass`, or `Notch`. Ranges from 0.1 to 10.

      For `Class.AudioFilter|FilterType` values of
      `Enum.AudioFilterType.Lowpass12dB|Lowpass12dB` and
      `Enum.AudioFilterType.Highpass12dB|Highpass12dB`, a **Q** value of
      `sqrt(2) / 2`, or `0.707`, corresponds to a flat filter at a 12dB/octave
      slope.
