name: AudioSpeechToText
type: class
memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  Converts spoken audio into text.
description: |
  `Class.AudioSpeechToText` is used to convert speech audio into text. This
  class provides a single **Input** pin that can be connected to other pins via
  `Class.Wire|Wires`.

  Roblox uses the following formula to throttle requests for this API based on
  the number of players in your experience:
  `max requests per minute per experience = 1 + (5 * number_of_concurrent_users)`. You can purchase additional usage using
  [Extended Services](../../../cloud-services/extended-services.md).

  For more information, see
  [Speech-to-text](../../../audio/objects.md#speech-to-text).

      Whether the `Class.AudioSpeechToText` object is detecting speech in the
      incoming audio signal. `Class.AudioSpeechToText` records the speech audio
      until it ceases or until a maximum amount of 10 seconds has been recorded.
      Then it converts the recorded audio into text.
