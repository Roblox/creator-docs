      Clones a place through the given `templatePlaceID` and returns the
      `Class.DataModel.PlaceId|PlaceId` of the new place, which you can use with
      `Class.TeleportService`. The clone place displays within the inventory of
      the place's creator with the given name and description.

      Note that the template place must have template copying enabled through
      place settings. You cannot use this method to clone places that you don't
      own.

      Frequent use of this API is not recommended, particularly if the created
      places contain scripts, as updating the code in a large volume of places
      quickly becomes infeasible. For user-generated worlds, consider
      serializing user creations and saving them in `Class.DataStore|DataStores`
      instead.

          Array of dictionary tables in the same order as the request, where

          Note that if an error occurs on fetching metadata for any of the
          requested assets, for example the asset ID doesn't exist, its
          dictionary table is still included in the returned array but it only
          contains the `AssetId` field for reference purposes. Additionally, if
          the `AudioType` cannot be determined for a given asset (perhaps
          because it's private audio), the resulting dictionary will not contain
          an `AudioType` entry.
