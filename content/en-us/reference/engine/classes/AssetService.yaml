      Controls whether `Class.AssetService:LoadAssetAsync()` can load assets
      that are not owned by the experience creator.
    description: |
      This property can only be modified in Studio's **Experience Settings** by
      changing **Allow Loading Third Party Assets**.

      When `false` (default), `Class.AssetService:LoadAssetAsync()` can only
      load assets that meet one of the following:

      - The asset must be **created or owned** by the game creator.
      - The asset must be **shared** by the asset owner.
      - The asset must be owned by Roblox.

      When `true`, `Class.AssetService:LoadAssetAsync()` can additionally load
      any public free asset on the Creator Store.

    summary: |
      Creates a Decal instance that uses composite PBR textures created by
      layering the provided textures in the order they are provided in the
      `layers` array. Textures layer based on the alpha value of the ColorMap.
    description: |
      Creates a new `Class.Decal` that contains a composed texture derived from
      one or more layered texture sets. Each set can include color, roughness,
      metalness, and normal maps. Each `layer` is composited in the order they
      are provided, with the ColorMap alpha channel used to determine blending.

      - There is a limit of 8 layers.
      - Layering order is bottom-to-top: the first layer in the list provides
        the bottom-most textures.
      - Each dictionary table should contain the following key-value pairs:
        - **ColorMap**: A `Datatype.Content` referencing a color (albedo)
          texture by assetId.
        - **RoughnessMap**: A `Datatype.Content` referencing a roughness texture
          by assetId.
        - **MetalnessMap**: A `Datatype.Content` referencing a metalness texture
          by assetId.
        - **NormalMap**: A `Datatype.Content` referencing a normal texture by
          assetId.
      - `ColorMap` is mandatory in every layer. The ColorMap's alpha channel is
        used to control blending of the entire layer.
      - `NormalMap`, `MetalnessMap`, `RoughnessMap` are optional. If omitted,
        this layer doesn't perform any blending for those maps.

      Frequent use of this API is not recommended, particularly if the created

          Array of dictionary tables in the same order as the request, where

          Note that if an error occurs on fetching metadata for any of the
          requested assets, for example the asset ID doesn't exist, its
          dictionary table is still included in the returned array but it only
          contains the `AssetId` field for reference purposes. Additionally, if
          the `AudioType` cannot be determined for a given asset (perhaps
          because it's private audio), the resulting dictionary will not contain
          an `AudioType` entry.

    description: |
      Loads the latest version of an asset from the given `assetId` and returns
      it wrapped in a `Class.Model`. This method is the modern replacement for
      `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` and
      `Class.InsertService:LoadAssetVersion()` methods.

      Calls to this function may fail if the asset does not exist, or if the
      server providing the model is having problems. It is recommended to wrap
      calls to this function in `pcall()` to handle potential errors.

      ```lua
      local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")

      local assetId = 257489726

      local success, model = pcall(AssetService.LoadAssetAsync, AssetService, assetId)
      if success and model then
      	print("Model loaded successfully")
      	model.Parent = workspace
      else
      	warn("Model failed to load:", model) -- 'model' will contain the error message
      end
      ```

      #### Script Sandbox Security

      For enhanced security, the returned `Class.Model` is sandboxed by default
      (`Class.Model.Sandboxed|Sandboxed` is `true`) and has no script
      `Enum.SecurityCapability|Capabilities`. This prevents untrusted scripts
      descending from the returned Model from running. To enable scripts in a
      model you trust, you can manually grant a safe set of
      `Enum.SecurityCapability|Capabilities` on the Model after loading.

      #### Third-Party Asset Loading

      Unlike `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()`, this method can load public
      assets created by **third parties** (assets not owned by the experience
      creator). To enable this functionality, toggle on **Allow Loading Third
      Party Assets** in Studio's **Experience Settings**.

      If this setting is disabled (which it is by default), `LoadAssetAsync`
      will only load assets that are owned by the experience creator, behaving
      identically to the old `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` security check.

        through the place's settings.
      - This method overwrites the previous state of the place. To revert a
        save, publish an older version of the place.
      - There are cases when saves can occur simultaneously in Studio and in
        multiple experience servers. The order of the saves happen in the order
        they are called.
      - An active Team Create session in Studio blocks all saves from occurring.
