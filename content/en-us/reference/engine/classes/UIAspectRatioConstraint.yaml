name: UIAspectRatioConstraint
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Ensures the parent UI element maintains a particular aspect ratio.
description: |
  The `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint` enforces a **width‑to‑height** aspect
  ratio on a `Class.GuiObject` regardless of its core size, even if that size is
  set as a percentage of its parent. For example, inserting this constraint as a
  child of a `Class.Frame` and setting the constraint's
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio` property to `2`
  (`2:1`) keeps the frame's width at twice that of its height. Similarly,
  setting this constraint's
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio` property to `0.5`
  (`0.5:1`) keeps the frame's width at half that of its height.

  Setting this constraint's
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio|AspectRatio` to the default of `1`
  (`1:1`) is a convenient way to prevent non‑proportional scaling/stretching of
  an `Class.ImageLabel` with a square image asset.

  Note that when a UI object is under control of both a layout structure such as
  `Class.UIListLayout` and a `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`, the constraint
  will **override** the layout and control the object's size.

      Determines the width-to-height ratio to maintain.
    description: |
      This property determines the width‑to‑height ratio to maintain. To flip
      the ratio to height‑to‑width, take the inverse (divide `1` by the number
      or raise to the -1st power). This value must be greater than `0`.

      This property determines how the maximum size of the object is limited.

      - When set to `Enum.AspectType.FitWithinMaxSize|FitWithinMaxSize`, the
        object will be the maximum size possible within its own
        `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize`.

      - When set to `Enum.AspectType.ScaleWithParentSize|ScaleWithParentSize`,
        the object's maximum size will be the size of the parent while still
        maintaining the aspect ratio.
