  Ensures the parent UI element maintains a particular aspect ratio.
description: |
  A UIAspectRatioConstraint ensures that the parent UI element
  (`Class.GuiObject`) maintains a particular aspect ratio even if its size is
  set as a percentage of its parent. If an object with this constraint is also
  under the control of a `Class.UILayout` such as `Class.UIGridLayout`, then the
  constraint controls the objects size and overwrites any size the layout would
  apply.

  When applied to a GuiObject, the UIAspectRatioConstraint will make sure that
  the objects ratio is maintained by the value defined in
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio`. The
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectType` sets what determines the maximum
  size of the object. When set to
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.FitWithinMaxSize`, the constraint will make the
  object the maximum size it can be within the `Class.GuiObject` of the element.
  When set to ScaleWithParentSize, the elements maximum size will be the size of
  the parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio. Finally, the
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint.DominantAxis` will determine which axis to use
  when setting the new size of the element.

    description: |
      AspectRatio determines the width-to-height ratio to maintain. To flip the
      ratio to height-to-width, take the inverse (divide 1 by the number or
      raise to the -1st power). This value must be greater than zero. Below, a
      white `Class.Frame` is placed within the a black `Class.Frame` with two
      different width-to-height ratios.

      AspectType determines what limits the maximum size of the element.

      - When set to FitWithinMaxSize, the constraint will make the object the
        maximum size it can be within its own `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize`.
      - When set to ScaleWithParentSize, the UI element's maximum size will be
        the size of the parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio..
