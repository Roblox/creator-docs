      Transforms the TerrainRegion so it can be used with smooth terrain.
    description: |
      Calling this method transforms the TerrainRegion into a
      `Class.TerrainRegion` usable for `Class.Terrain`. This can only be done
      from a plugin, when in edit mode.

      The game can't be running, nor can it have a `Class.NetworkServer`.
