  The VelocityMotor is a special type of joint that works similarly to a
  `Class.Motor`, but it uses a `Class.MotorFeature` and a `Class.Hole` to create
  the connection. In order for this object to work correctly:

  - The VelocityMotor must be parented inside of a `Class.MotorFeature`
  - The `Class.MotorFeature` needs to be parented inside of a `Class.BasePart`
  - A `Class.Hole` needs to be parented inside of another `Class.BasePart`
  - The VelocityMotor's `Class.VelocityMotor.Hole` property should be assigned
    to the hole you parented inside of the other part.
