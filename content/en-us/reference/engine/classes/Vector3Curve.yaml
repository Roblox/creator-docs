  Represents a 3D vector curve containing 3 `Class.FloatCurve|FloatCurves`,
  stored as 3 FloatCurve children instances. Each FloatCurve can be accessed via
  `Class.Vector3Curve:X()`, `Class.Vector3Curve:Y()`, `Class.Vector3Curve:Z()`
  methods. The 3 axes can be sampled simultaneously via the method
  `Class.Vector3Curve:GetValueAtTime()`.

    summary: |
      Samples the 3 FloatCurves (X, Y, Z) at the time passed as argument.
      Returns the 3 samples as a tuple of 3 numbers. If a channel curve is
      missing or no key is found in the curve the channel is evaluated as nil.
