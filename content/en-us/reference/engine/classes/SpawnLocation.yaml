  `Class.SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations`, or "spawns" determine where a
  `Class.Player` respawns when they die. They can be configured to allow only
  certain players to use each spawn, using `Class.Team|Teams`. They also control
  how `Class.ForceField|ForceFields` are set up for newly-spawned players.

  SpawnLocations, or "spawns" determine where a `Class.Player` respawns when
  they die. They can be configured to allow only certain players to use each
  spawn, using `Class.Team|Teams`. They also control how
  `Class.ForceField|ForceFields` are set up for newly-spawned players.

  SpawnLocations can be used as checkpoints, such as in an obstacle course,
  using the `Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` property, so that when
  a player touches it, they will change teams to the SpawnLocation's team. In
  this case, only the first `Class.Team` should have `Class.Team.AutoAssignable`
  set to true, else players will not start at the first checkpoint.

  Note if a SpawnLocation is added to the `Class.Workspace` in Studio with
  `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` set to false a Team will be created
  corresponding to `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` if it does not already exist.
  This behavior does not occur when spawns are created in-game using a
  `Class.Script` or if the properties of the SpawnLocation are changed after
  already being added. It is recommended that developers always set up their
  teams manually and not rely on this behavior.

  ## Spawning Rules

  There are several rules that come into play for a given SpawnLocation when a
  player respawns:

  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` is set to false only
    `Class.Player|Players` with `Class.Player.TeamColor` matching
    `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` will respawn above it
  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` is set to true any Player can spawn above
    it regardless of `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor`
  - If multiple eligible spawns are available to a `Class.Player`, a random one
    will be chosen
  - Players will spawn at different points on top of a SpawnLocation, but
    currently, they may still spawn on top of each other if they spawn right
    after one and other

    look at the `Class.Players.RespawnTime|RespawnTime` property

      Allows a `Class.Player` to join the team by touching the
      `Class.SpawnLocation`. When set to true, if a `Class.Player` character
      comes into contact with the `Class.SpawnLocation`, the player's
      `Class.Player.TeamColor` will be set to `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor`.

      `Class.Player.Neutral` will also be set to `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral`
      upon contact, meaning a player can also become neutral by touching a spawn
      location.

      This will not function when `Class.SpawnLocation.Enabled` is set to false.

      #### Making Checkpoints

      This feature is often used to make checkpoints in obstacle courses or
      similar games.

      The length of time, in seconds, that a `Class.ForceField` will be applied
      to a `Class.Player` character spawning at this `Class.SpawnLocation`. If
      Duration is zero, the `Class.ForceField` is never created, and it will not
      trigger the `Class.Instance.DescendantAdded` or
      `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` events.

      This default value of this property is 10 seconds.

      The duration feature allows developers to easily give
      `Class.Player|Players` protection from 'spawn killing' which can be a
      frustrating experience for players. Note, `Class.ForceField|ForceFields`
      will only protect users from `Class.Explosion|Explosions` and weapons that
      use `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` to deal damage or otherwise check for a
      `Class.ForceField`.

      players cannot spawn at the `Class.SpawnLocation` and the
      `Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` functionality is disabled.

      This property provides the most convenient way of preventing
      `Class.Player|Players` from spawning at a spawn.

      Note, although team changing on touch using
      `Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` is disabled when Enabled is
      set to false, other touched events using `Class.BasePart.Touched` will
      still fire.

      If Neutral is set to false, only players whose `Class.Player.TeamColor` is
