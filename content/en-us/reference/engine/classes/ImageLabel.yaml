name: ImageLabel
type: class
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  A 2D user interface element that displays a single non-interactive image.
description: |
  An `Class.ImageLabel` renders a rectangle, like a `Class.Frame` does, with an
  image asset. The display of the image can be manipulated through the
  `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3|ImageColor3` and
  `Class.ImageLabel.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency` properties. To display
  only the image and hide the rectangle, set
  `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` to `1`.

  Advanced `Class.ImageLabel` usage includes:

  - Tiled images can be created by setting
    `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType|ScaleType` to `Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, then
    `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize` to the size of rendered tiles.

  - 9-slice images can be created by setting
    `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType|ScaleType` to `Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, then
    `Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter|SliceCenter` to the center area of the 9‑slice
    image.

  - Sprite sheets can be implemented through the use of
    `Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectOffset|ImageRectOffset` and
    `Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectSize|ImageRectSize`. Packing multiple images into
    one and using this property can make your experience's image assets load
    much quicker, especially if you use many small icons in your GUIs.

      This property is a content-type property that should hold the asset ID of
      a decal or image uploaded to Roblox. It functions identically to
      `Class.Decal.Texture` with regards to loading the image from Roblox. The
      rendered image can be modified using
      `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3|ImageColor3` and

      This property determines how an image is colorized. When set to white, no
      colorization occurs. This property is very useful for reusing image
      assets; if the source image is completely white with transparency, you can
      set the entire color of the image at once with this property.

    description: |
      This property should hold an
      [asset URI](../../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-uris) or a reference
      to an `Class.EditableImage` object.

      The asset URI can reference a decal or image uploaded to Roblox. It
      functions identically to `Class.Decal.Texture` with regards to loading the
      image.

      The rendered image will be colorized using
      `Class.ImageButton.ImageColor3`. It is possible to make the image render
      as tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by adjusting the
      `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType` property.

    summary: |
      Determines how an image will scale if displayed in a UI element whose size
      differs from the source image.
    description: |
      This property determines in what way an `Class.ImageLabel.Image` is
      rendered when the UI element's absolute size differs from the source
      image's size.

      By default, this property is `Enum.ScaleType.Stretch` which will simply
      stretch/compact the image dimensions so it fits the UI element's space
      exactly. Since transparent pixels are set to black when uploading to
      Roblox, transparent images should apply alpha blending to avoid a blackish
      outline around scaled images.

      For `Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, the `Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter|SliceCenter`
      property will be revealed in the
      [Properties](../../../studio/properties.md) window. This is for nine-slice
      UI: when scaling up, the corners will remain the source image size. The
      edges of the image will stretch to the width/height of the image. Finally,
      the center of the image will stretch to fill the center area of the image.

      Finally, for `Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, the
      `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize` property will be revealed in the
      [Properties](../../../studio/properties.md) window. This is for tiled
      images, where the size of each image tile is determined by the
      `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize|TileSize` property.

      starts at the top-left corner of the image. This property is only active
