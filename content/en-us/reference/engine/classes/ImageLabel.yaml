name: ImageLabel
type: class
category: GUI
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  A 2D user interface element that displays a single non-interactive image.
description: |
  An ImageLabel renders a rectangle, like a `Class.Frame` does, with an image.
  The image must be a decal uploaded to the Roblox website. The display of the
  image can be manipulated through the `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3` and
  `Class.ImageLabel.ImageTransparency` properties. To display only the image and
  hide the rectangle, set `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` to 1.

  The image is scaled to fit the entirety of the rectangle, but remember that
  images look best when displayed at their native resolution. Before uploading
  your image asset, you may want to apply alpha bleeding and take a few more
  steps when building UI for high-DPI devices (like phones).

  ## Advanced ImageLabel usage

  - **Spritesheets** can be used with ImageLabel through the use of
    `Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectOffset` and `Class.ImageLabel.ImageRectSize`.
    Packing multiple images into one and using this property can make your
    game's image assets load much quicker, especially if you use many small
    icons in your GUIs.
  - 9-slice images can be created by setting `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType` to
    `Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, then `Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter` to the center
    area of the 9-slice image.
  - Tiled images can be created by setting `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType` to
    `Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, then `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize` to be the size of
    rendered tiles.

      The image content displayed by the UI element.
    description: |
      The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset
      ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to
      `Class.Decal.Texture` with regards to loading the image from the Roblox
      website. The rendered image will be colorized using
      `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3`. It is possible to make the image render as
      tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by adjusting the
      `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType` property.

      The ImageColor3 property determines how an image is colorized. When set to
      white, no colorization occurs. This property is very useful for reusing
      image assets: If the source image is completely white with transparency,
      you can set the entire color of the image at once with this property.

      larger or smaller than its size in texture memory. When set to

      preserves the sharp edges of pixels.

    summary: |
      Determines how an image will scale if displayed in a UI element whose size
      differs from the source image.
    description: |
      The ScaleType property determines in what way an `Class.ImageLabel.Image`
      is rendered when the UI element's absolute size differs from the source
      image's size.

      By default, this property is
      `Enum.ScaleType.Stretch|Enum.ScaleType.Stretch`, which will simply
      stretch/compact the image dimensions so it fits the UI element's space
      exactly. Since transparent pixels are set to black when uploading to the
      Roblox website, transparent images should apply alpha blending to avoid a
      blackish outline around scaled images.

      For `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, the
      `Class.ImageLabel.SliceCenter` property will be revealed in the Properties
      window. This is for nine-slice UI: when scaling up, the corners will
      remain the source image size. The edges of the image will stretch to the
      width/height of the image. Finally, the center of the image will stretch
      to fill the center area of the image.

      Finally, for `Enum.ScaleType.Tile|Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, the
      `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize` property will be revealed in the Properties
      window. This is for tiled images, where the size of each image tile is
      determined by the `Class.ImageLabel.TileSize` property.

      The SliceCenter property sets the slice boundaries of a 9-sliced image
      when `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType` is set to
      `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`. Please note that this
      property is only visible in the Studio Properties Pane if
      `Class.ImageLabel.ScaleType` is set to
      `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`. Select this property and
      click the "..." button to open the 9-Slice Editor, a built-in visual
      editor for setting the slice boundaries.

      Scales the 9slice edges by the specified ratio. This means that the edges
      around the 9slice will grow as if you'd uploaded a new version of the
      texture upscaled. Defaults to 1.0.

      As a multiplier for the borders of a 9slice, it is useful for reusing one
      rounded corner image for multiple radii.

    summary: |
      Sets the tiling size of the ImageLabel.
    description: |
      TileSize sets the tiling size of the ImageLabel. The default
      `Datatype.UDim2` values are 1,0,1,0. The scale component of the UDim2 will
      scale the tile based on the size of the ImageLabel. The offset is in raw
      pixels. The tiling starts at the upper left-hand corner of the image. For
      example a scale of 0.5 will mean the tile will be half the size of the
      ImageLabel (in the corresponding axis).

      This property is only active if the ScaleType for the ImageLabel is set to
      Tile instead of Slice or Stretch.
