summary: |
  Applies torque on an assembly to maintain a constant angular velocity.
description: |
  The `AngularVelocity` constraint applies torque on an assembly to maintain a
  **constant** angular velocity. Alternatively:

  - If you want to control the amount of torque applied, use a `Class.Torque`
    constraint.
  - If you only need **initial** angular velocity, set the
    `Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity` method
    directly on the assembly.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Relativity

  Application of velocity can be controlled through the constraint's
  `Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` property. If set to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World`, the angular velocity vector is used as is. If
  set to `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1` and the constraint's
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` property is set to another
  attachment, the angular velocity will be affected by that of the other
  attachment. Setting `Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1` also exposes the
  `Class.AngularVelocity.ReactionTorqueEnabled|ReactionTorqueEnabled` property.

    summary: |
      Causes the constraint to apply equal and opposite reaction forces.
    description: |
      This property, when enabled, causes the constraint to apply equal and
      opposite reaction forces. This is important if the two attached parts can
      collide, since without reaction forces collisions can create energy that
      would otherwise be disregarded.

      When enabled, the reaction forces cause the constraint to act like an
      angular motor between the two attachments.

      Only meaningful when `Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set
      to `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1`.

      The `Datatype.CFrame` in which the `AngularVelocity` force is specified.
      If set to `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World`, the angular velocity vector is
      used as is. If set to `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1`, the angular
      velocity is transformed by the `Datatype.CFrame` of the assigned
      attachment.

      `Class.AngularVelocity.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` can also be set to
      `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment0`, but it makes no physical sense and
      will lead to unpredictable behaviors.
