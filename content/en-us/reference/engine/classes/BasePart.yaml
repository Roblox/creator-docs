  The abstract base class for in-world objects that physically interact.
description: |
  `Class.BasePart` is an abstract base class for in-world objects that render
  and are physically simulated while in the `Class.Workspace`. There are several
  implementations of `Class.BasePart`, the most common being `Class.Part` and
  `Class.MeshPart`. Others include `Class.WedgePart`, `Class.SpawnLocation`, and
  the singleton `Class.Terrain` object. Generally, when documentation refers to
  a "part," most `Class.BasePart` implementations will work and not just
  `Class.Part`.

  For information on how `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are grouped into simulated
  rigid bodies, see [Assemblies](../../../physics/assemblies.md).

  There are many different objects that interact with `Class.BasePart` (other
  than `Class.Terrain`), including:

  - Several `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` may be grouped within a `Class.Model` and
    moved at the same time using `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()`. See
    [Models](../../../parts/models.md).
  - A `Class.Decal` applies a stretched image texture to the faces of a
    `Class.BasePart`, while a `Class.Texture` applies a tiled image texture to
    the faces. See [Textures and Decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md).
  - A `Class.SurfaceGui` renders `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` on the face of a
    part. See
    [In-Experience UI Containers](../../../ui/in-experience-containers.md).
  - `Class.Attachment|Attachments` can be added to a `Class.BasePart` to specify
    `Datatype.CFrame|CFrames` relative to the part. These are often used by
    physical `Class.Constraint` objects as outlined in
    [Mechanical Constraints](../../../physics/mechanical-constraints.md) and
    [Mover Constraints](../../../physics/mover-constraints.md).
  - `Class.ParticleEmitter` objects emit particles uniformly in the volume of
    the `Class.BasePart` to which they are parented. See
    [Particle Emitters](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md).
  - Light objects like `Class.PointLight` emit light from the center of a
    `Class.BasePart` as illustrated in
    [Light Sources](../../../effects/light-sources.md).
  - If parented to a `Class.Tool` and given the name **Handle**, a
    `Class.BasePart` can be held by characters. See
    [In-Experience Tools](../../../players/tools.md).

properties:
  - name: BasePart.Anchored
    summary: |
      Determines whether a part is immovable by physics.
    description: |
      The **Anchored** property determines whether the part will be immovable by
      physics. When enabled, a part will never change position due to gravity,
      other part collisions, overlapping other parts, or any other
      physics-related causes. As a result, two anchored parts will never fire
      the `Class.BasePart.Touched` event on each other.

      An anchored part may still be moved by changing its
      `Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame` or `Class.BasePart.Position|Position`, and
      it still may have a nonzero
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity` and
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity`.

      Finally, if an unanchored part is joined with an anchored part through an
      object like a `Class.Weld`, it too will act anchored. If such a joint
      breaks, the part may be affected by physics again. See
      [Assemblies](../../../physics/assemblies.md) for more details.

      Network ownership cannot be set on anchored parts. If a part's anchored
      status changes on the server, the network ownership of that part will be
      affected.

      If the assembly has an anchored part, that part's center of mass will be
      the assembly's center of mass, and the assembly will have infinite mass.

      Knowing the center of mass can help the assembly maintain stability. A
      force applied to the center of mass will not cause angular acceleration,
      only linear. An assembly with a low center of mass will have a better time
      staying upright under the effect of gravity.

    description: |
      The **CFrame** property determines both the position and orientation of
      the `Class.BasePart` in the world. It acts as an arbitrary reference
      location on the geometry, but `Class.BasePart.ExtentsCFrame|ExtentsCFrame`
      represents the actual `Datatype.CFrame` of its physical center.

      When setting **CFrame** on a part, other joined parts are also moved
      relative to the part, but it is recommended that you use
      `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()` to move an entire model, such as when
      teleporting a player's character.

      Unlike setting `Class.BasePart.Position`, setting `Class.BasePart.CFrame`
      will always move the part to the exact given `Datatype.CFrame`; in other
      words: **no overlap checking is done** and the physics solver will attempt
      to resolve any overlap unless both parts are
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored`.

      For keeping track of positions relative to a part's `Datatype.CFrame`, an
      `Class.Attachment` may be useful.

      uninterrupted. Parts used for **decoration** usually have CanCollide
      disabled, as they need not be considered by the physics engine.

      If a part is not `Class.BasePart.Anchored` and has CanCollide disabled, it
      may fall out of the world to be eventually destroyed by
      `Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight`.

      When CanCollide is disabled, parts may still fire the

      You can disable this with `Class.BasePart.CanTouch`.

      This property determines if `Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched` and

      other touching parts must also have `Class.BasePart.CanTouch|CanTouch` set
      to `true` for touch events to fire. If `false`, touch events cannot be set
      up for the part and attempting to do so will throw an error. Similarly, if
      the property is set to `false` after a touch event is connected, the event
      will be disconnected and the `Class.TouchTransmitter` removed.

      Note that this collision logic can be set to respect
      [collision groups](../../../workspace/collisions.md#collision-filtering)
      through the `Class.Workspace.TouchesUseCollisionGroups` property. If
      `true`, parts in non-colliding groups will ignore both collisions **and**
      touch events, thereby making this property irrelevant.

      #### Performance

      There is a small performance gain on parts that have both
      `Class.BasePart.CanTouch|CanTouch` and
      `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|CanCollide` set to `false`, as these parts will
      never need to compute any kind of part to part collisions. However, they
      can still be hit by `Class.WorldRoot:Raycast()|Raycasts` and
      `Datatype.OverlapParams` queries.

    description: |
      If this property is enabled, the `Class.BasePart|BasePart` will not
      contribute to the total mass or inertia of its assembly as long as it is
      welded to another part that has mass.

      If the part is its own root part according to
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyRootPart|AssemblyRootPart`, this will be ignored
      for that part, and it will still contribute mass and inertia to its
      assembly like a normal part. Parts that are massless should never become
      an assembly root part unless all other parts in the assembly are also
      massless.

      This might be useful for things like optional accessories on vehicles that
      you don't want to affect the handling of the car or a massless render mesh
      welded to a simpler collision mesh.

    summary: |
      Determines the texture and default physical properties of a part.
    description: |
      The Material property allows a builder to set a part's texture and default
      physical properties (in the case that
      `Class.BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties` is unset). The default Plastic
      material has a very light texture, and the SmoothPlastic material has no
      texture at all. Some material textures like DiamondPlate and Granite have
      very visible textures. Each material's texture reflects sunlight
      differently, especially Foil.

      Setting this property then enabling
      `Class.BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties` will use the default physical
      properties of a material. For instance, DiamondPlate is a very dense
      material while Wood is very light. A part's density determines whether it
      will float in terrain water.

      The Glass material changes rendering behavior on moderate graphics
      settings. It applies a bit of reflectiveness (similar to
      `Class.BasePart.Reflectance`) and perspective distortion. The effect is
      especially pronounced on sphere-shaped parts (set `Class.BasePart.Shape`
      to Ball). Semitransparent objects and Glass parts behind Glass are not
      visible.

      The Orientation property describes the part's rotation in degrees around

      [Tait-Bryan angles][2], which describe **yaw, pitch and roll**. It is also
      worth noting how this property differs from the `Datatype.CFrame.Angles()`
      constructor, which applies rotations in a different order (Z → Y → X). For
      better control over the rotation of a part, it is recommended that
      `Class.BasePart.CFrame` is set instead.

      The TopParamA property is relevant when a part's

      The TopSurface property determines the type of surface used for the +Y
      direction of a part. When two parts' faces are placed next to each other,
      they may create a joint between them. If set to Motor, the
      `Class.BasePart.TopSurfaceInput` determines how a motor joint should
      behave.

      Most SurfaceTypes render a texture on the part face if the
      `Class.BasePart.Material` is set to Plastic. Some SurfaceTypes - Hinge,
      Motor and SteppingMotor - will render a 3D adornment instead. If this
      property is selected in the Properties window, it will be highlighted in
      the game world similar to that of a `Class.SurfaceSelection`.

    summary: |
      Determines how much a part can be seen through (the inverse of part
      opacity).
    description: |
      The Transparency property controls the visibility of a part on a scale of
      0 to 1, where 0 is completely visible (opaque), and a value of 1 is
      completely invisible (not rendered at all).

      `Class.BasePart.Reflectance` can reduce the overall transparency of a
      brick if set to a value close to 1.

      While fully transparent parts are not rendered at all, partially
      transparent objects have some significant rendering costs. Having many
      translucent parts may slow down the game's performance.

      When transparent parts overlap, render order can act unpredictable - try
      to keep semi-transparent parts from overlapping to avoid this.

      The `Class.BasePart.LocalTransparencyModifier` is a multiplier to
      Transparency that is only visible to the local client.

    summary: |
      Determines a part's change in position over time.
    description: |
      The Velocity of a part describes how its `Class.BasePart.Position` is
      presently changing. The unit of this property is **studs per second**. For
      reference, the default Roblox character moves at 16 studs per second via
      `Class.Humanoid.WalkSpeed`. The acceleration due to gravity is found in
      `Class.Workspace.Gravity` (by default, -196.2 studs per second per
      second).

      Setting the Velocity of a part that is `Class.BasePart.Anchored` will
      cause it to act like a conveyor belt. Any object that touches the part
      will begin to move in accordance with the Velocity.

      Some `Class.BodyMover` objects will apply forces and thus change the
      Velocity of a part over time. The simplest of these is a `Class.BodyForce`
      which can be used to counteract the acceleration due to gravity on a
      single part (set the +Y axis of the `Class.BodyForce.Force` to the product
      of the mass (`Class.BasePart:GetMass()`) and the gravity constant).

      Creates a joint on any side of the `Class.BasePart|Part` that has a
      `Enum.SurfaceType` that can make a joint it will create a joint with any
      adjacent parts.

      Joints will be created between the sides and any planar touching surfaces,
      depending on the sides' surfaces.

      - Smooth surfaces will not create joints
      - Glue surfaces will create a `Class.Glue` joint
      - Weld will create a `Class.Weld` joint with any surface except for
        Unjoinable
      - Studs, Inlet, or Universal will each create a `Class.Snap` joint with
        either of other the other two surfaces (e.g. Studs with Inlet and
        Universal)
      - Hinge and Motor surfaces create `Class.Rotate` and `Class.RotateV` joint
        instances

      Unlike `Class.Model:MakeJoints()`, this function requires an array of
      parts as a parameter. This array is given as follows:

      ```
      part:MakeJoints({part1, part2, part3})
      ```

      Joints are broken if enough force is applied to them due to an
      `Class.Explosion`, unless a `Class.ForceField` object is parented to the
      `Class.BasePart` or ancestor `Class.Model`. For this reason, they are
      often used to make simple destructible buildings and other models.

      to `Class.Instance:Clone()|Clone()`, the returned object has no set
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent`.

      The following properties from the calling part are applied to the
      resulting `Class.IntersectOperation`:

      - `Class.BasePart.Color|Color`, `Class.BasePart.Material|Material`,
        `Class.BasePart.MaterialVariant|MaterialVariant`,

      In the following image comparison,
      `Class.BasePart:IntersectAsync()|IntersectAsync()` is called on the purple
      block using a table containing the blue block. The resulting
      `Class.IntersectOperation` resolves into a shape of the intersecting
      geometry of both parts.

      #### Notes

      - The original parts remain intact following a successful intersect
        operation. In most cases, you should `Class.Instance.Destroy|Destroy()`
        all of the original parts and parent the returned
        `Class.IntersectOperation` to the same place as the calling
        `Class.BasePart`.
      - By default, the face colors of the resulting intersection are borrowed
        from the `Class.BasePart.Color|Color` property of the original parts. To
        change the entire intersection to a specific color, set its
        `Class.PartOperation.UsePartColor|UsePartColor` property to `true`.
      - If an intersect operation would result in a part with more than 20,000
        triangles, it will be simplified to 20,000 triangles.
