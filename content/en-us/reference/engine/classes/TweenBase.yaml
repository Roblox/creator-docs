    summary: |
      Halts playback and resets the tween variables. If you then call
      `Class.TweenBase:Play()`, the properties of the tween resume interpolating
      towards their destination, but take the full length of the animation to do
      so.

      Halts playback of a `Class.Tween` and resets the tween variables.

      Only resets the tween variables, not the properties being changed by the
      tween. If you cancel a tween halfway through its animation, the properties
      do not reset to their original values. Differs from
      `Class.TweenBase:Pause()` in that once resumed, it takes the full duration
      of the tween to complete the animation.

  - name: TweenBase:Pause
    summary: |
      Halts playback of the tween. Doesn't reset its progress variables, meaning
      that if you call `Class.TweenBase:Play()`, the tween resumes playback from
      the moment it was paused.

      that if you call `Class.TweenBase:Play()`, the tween resumes playback from
      the moment it was paused.

      If you want to reset the progress variables of the tween, use
      `Class.TweenBase:Cancel()`.

      You can only pause tweens that are in the `Class.TweenBase.PlaybackState|PlaybackState`
      of `Enum. PlaybackState.Playing`; tweens in other states won't pause.
      If a tween is in a different
      `Class.TweenBase.PlaybackState|PlaybackState` such as `Enum. PlaybackState.Delayed`
      (as a result of its `Datatype.TweenInfo.DelayTime` being greater than 0),
      attempting to pause the tween will fail and the tween will play following its specified
      delay time.

      Starts playback of a tween. Note that if playback has already started,
      calling `Play()` has no effect unless the tween has finished or is stopped
      (either by `Class.TweenBase:Cancel()` or `Class.TweenBase:Pause()`).

      (either by `Class.TweenBase:Cancel()` or `Class.TweenBase:Pause()`).

      Multiple tweens can be played on the same object at the same time, but
      they must not animate the same property. If two tweens attempt to modify
      the same property, the initial tween is cancelled and overwritten by the
      most recent tween (see examples).

      Passes the `Enum.PlaybackState` of the tween to any connected functions to

      `Class.TweenBase:Pause()` does not fire the `Completed` event.
