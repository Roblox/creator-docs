  Applies constant torque to an assembly from its center of mass.
description: |
  A **Torque** constraint applies constant torque to an assembly from its center
  of mass. Alternatively:

  - Because the `Class.Torque` constraint applies **constant** torque and
    angular acceleration, very high speeds may result if no other forces are
    involved. If you want to maintain a more steady velocity over time, use an
    `Class.AngularVelocity` constraint.
  - If you only need **initial** velocity, set the
    `Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity` property
    directly on the assembly.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Relativity

  By default, torque is applied relative to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. If the parent assembly rotates,
  the torque will change direction to match the adjusted orientation of the
  attachment.

  If `Class.Torque.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World`, torque will be applied in world coordinates,
  independent of the parent or attachment orientations.

  If `Class.Torque.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1`, torque will be applied relative to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` and, if the attachment rotates,
  change to match its orientation.
