name: BodyThrust
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a constant force to an object at a specific point.
description: |
  The `BodyThrust` object applies a force relative to the assembly to which it
  is parented at a specific location. It behaves similar to a `Class.BodyForce`
  except that this object's force applies at a specific point
  (`Class.BodyThrust.Location|Location`), allowing you to exert a torque
  (rotational force). To apply a force dynamically so that an assembly maintains
  a constant angular velocity, use a `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` instead. To
  apply a force dynamically so that an assembly maintains a constant orientation
  (angular position), use a `Class.BodyGyro`.

  This object is deprecated and should not be used for new work. Use
  `Class.VectorForce` instead, and see the

  - name: BodyThrust.Force
    summary: |
      Determines the amount of force exerted on each axis relative to the
      assembly.
    description: |
      This property determines the amount of force exerted on each axis relative
      to the assembly. The force is exerted at the
      `Class.BodyThrust.Location|Location` which is also relative to the
      assembly.

    description: |
      This property determines the relative position where the
      `Class.BodyThrust.Force|Force` is exerted. This is the primary means for
      turning force into torque.
