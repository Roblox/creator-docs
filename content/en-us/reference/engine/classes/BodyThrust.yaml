summary: |
  Applies a constant force to an object at a specific point.
description: |
  The BodyThrust object applies (or exerts) a force relative to the part to
  which it is parented at a specific location. It behaves similar to a
  `Class.BodyForce`, except that this object's force applies at a specific point
  (`Class.BodyThrust.Location`), allowing you to exert a [torque][1] (rotational
  force). To apply a force dynamically so that a part maintains a constant
  angular velocity, use a `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` instead. To apply a force
  dynamically so that a part maintains a constant orientation (angular
  position), use a `Class.BodyGyro`.

      Determines the amount of force exerted on each axis relative to the part.
    description: |
      The Force property determines the amount of force exerted on each axis
      relative to the part. Unlike `Class.BodyForce.Force`, this property is
      relative to the part and not the world. The force is exerted at the
      `Class.BodyThrust.Location|Location`, which is also relative to the part.

      is exerted.

      The Location property determines the relative offset from the center part
      at which the `Class.BodyThrust.Force` is exerted. This is the primary
      means for turning force into torque.
