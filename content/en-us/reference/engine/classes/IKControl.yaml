  Specifies a control to generate a procedural animation pose using Inverse
  Kinematics.
description: |
  **IKControl** instances generate procedural animation poses using Inverse
  Kinematics (IK). They allow you to make characters respond realistically to
  their environment.

  For example, you can make a character place its hand on a door handle exactly,
  and the character will do so independently of its position. IKControls provide
  the advantage of needing to create much fewer animations for your game while
  giving your experience a more realistic and polished feel.

  `Class.IKControl|IKControls` must be a child of a `Class.Humanoid` or
  `Class.AnimationController` with an `Class.Animator` and have all of their
  required properties set properly, otherwise they don't have any effect. The
  required properties are `Class.IKControl.Type|Type`,
  `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`, `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`,
  `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot`. As soon as those are set, the IkControl
  modifies the pose of your character as you specify. The following code sample
  demonstrates how to set up your first `Class.IKControl` and get started with
  creating more realistic animations for your game.

  You can use IKControls to make a character:

  - Rotate its head and torso to look at a point of interest in the world.
  - Modify its feet positions to respond to dynamic terrain. Adjust its legs and
    feet to place them accordingly on terrain with rocks and slopes.
  - Hold a gun and place its hands appropriately on the grip without needing to
    create animations for each gun in the game.
  - Aim at a point in the world, so that the tip of the gun point exactly at
    what you want to shoot. Especially useful in third person shooters.
  - Place its hands on the steering wheel of a car and follow it when it
    rotates.
  - Much more!

  `Class.IKControl` will override the animation for all the parts between the
  `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` and the
  `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`. You can enable/disable it using
  `Class.IKControl.Enabled|Enabled` or change how much they have an effect over
  the underlying animation using the `Class.IKControl.Weight|Weight`. Be
  careful: if you do not set up your `Class.IKControl|IKControls` correctly, you
  might generate bad and unrealistic poses!

  - name: IKControl.ChainRoot
    summary: |
      The last part that you are interested in moving your character. For
      example, the upper arm. Must be an ancestor of
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` and be a `Class.BasePart` or a
      `Class.Bone` in your character.
    description: |
      By specifying a `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` and an
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`, you instruct the
      `Class.IKControl` that it's allowed to move and rotate all parts between
      the two to move the `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` to the
      `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`. For example, if you specify the LeftHand
      as `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` and LeftUpperArm as the
      `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot`, the control moves 3 parts: the
      LeftHand, the LeftLowerArm, and the LeftUpperArm. Avoid setting
      `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` as the actual root of the character
      because that produces unrealistic results.

      The part that you are interested in moving to reach the

      Must be a descendant of `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` and be a
      `Class.BasePart` or a `Class.Bone` in your character.
    description: |
      The `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` describes the last part in
      the chain of your character that you want to affect. For example, it could
      be the hand when you want to move the whole arm to reach a point. It can
      be a `Class.BasePart` on a character, that has a `Class.Motor6D` as its
      child, a `Class.Motor6D` directly, a `Class.Bone`, or a
      `Class.Attachment`. The pivot of the selected
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` moves to the
      `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`, so you can use
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments` to modify which point of a `Class.BasePart`
      should reach the `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`.

    summary: |
      An additional offset applied on top of the

    description: |
      The end-effector offset is an additional `Datatype.CFrame` applied on top
      of the `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` `Datatype.CFrame` that produces the
      final `Datatype.CFrame` used to place the
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`. By default, it's the identity
      CFrame, so if you don't set it, it has no effect and the
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` uses the
      `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` `Datatype.CFrame` directly, which is
      specified in the local space of the
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`.

      Alternatively, you can use Attachments by setting an Attachment as
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`, which moves it to the
      `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` instead of the parts it's attached to,
      effectively obtaining the same result.

      You can also use `Class.IKControl.EndEffectorOffset|EndEffectorOffset` to
      modify which axis of the `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` should
      point at the `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` when using `LookAt` as
      `Class.IKControl.Type|Type`.

      animate it to create procedural animations such as typing on a keyboard.
      It's useful when the `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` and
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` aren't aligned and you need to

    summary: |
      An optional instance that determines which way the chain bends. You can

    description: |
      The `Class.IKControl.Pole|Pole` is an optional `Class.Instance` that gives
      you control over how intermediate parts in your character should bend. It
      can be anything that has a position in the world, such as
      `Class.BasePart`, `Class.Attachment`, `Class.Bone`, `Class.Motor6D`. It is
      by default nil. When you specify it, the underlying solver will make the
      parts bend towards it. When it is nil, the solver will try to make elbows
      and knees bend appropriately based on the limb of the character. The limb
      will be "Arm" when you select as `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector`
      either the _LeftHand_ or _RightHand_ and as
      `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` the corresponding _LeftUpperArm_ or
      _RightUpperArm_, and it will be "Leg" when you select as
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` either the _LeftFoot_ or
      _RightFoot_ and as `Class.IKControl.ChainRoot|ChainRoot` the corresponding
      _LeftUpperLeg_ or _RightUpperLeg_. In all other cases, if you don't
      specify a pole, the chain might not bend as you expect.

    description: |
      When multiple controls are active on a character, the order in which they
      are solved by the underlying system affects the final generated pose. By
      changing this value, you specify the ordering in which controls are
      satisfied. Higher values have higher priority, and higher-priority
      controls are resolved later because their result might override the
      previous result of other controls. If you have multiple IK controls on a
      character and one is more important than the other, specify a lower
      priority for it. It is 0 by default, meaning all controls have the same
      priority.

      This value specifies the average number of seconds that it takes for the
      `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` to reach the
      `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`. The behavior is that of a
      critically-damped spring, where the rate of change is proportional to the
      distance to the target and no oscillations are present when approaching
      the target. Smaller values create a quicker convergence, and larger values
      create a slower convergence. A value of 0 disables smoothing. The default
      value is 0.05 to provide a very slight smoothing that makes the motion
      feel realistic.

      The `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` represents a point (`Datatype.CFrame`)

      `Class.IKControl.Type|Type` property, and an additional
      `Class.IKControl.Offset|Offset` can be applied on top of it to modify it.
      If you set a `Class.IKControl.Target|Target` that will be moved either by
      physics or a script, at each frame the `Class.IKControl` will try to
      satisfy it, automatically updating the point to reach.

      By changing the `Class.IKControl.Type|Type`, you can change the behavior

      - Rotation: aligns the `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` rotation
        to that of the `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`.
      - LookAt: moves and orients the whole chain to make an axis (by default
        the forward axis) on the `Class.IKControl.EndEffector|EndEffector` point
        at a position in the world specified by `Class.IKControl.Target|Target`.

    description: |
      You can control how much a given control affects the character pose by
      using this property. Values should be in the [0, 1] range. 0 means no
      effect, and 1 means full effect of the IK control. Values outside this
      range are truncated. Smoothly varying this value allows you to blend in or
      out a specific control to avoid jarring motion. It is 1 by default.

      The weight determines the interpolation factor between the End-Effector
      and the IK target. Setting the weight to 0 doesn't disable the IK Control
      because other factors, including the SmoothTime smoothing factor and Pole,
      can still change the pose. To truly disable the IK Control, turn the
      `Class.IKControl.Enabled|Enabled` property to false.
