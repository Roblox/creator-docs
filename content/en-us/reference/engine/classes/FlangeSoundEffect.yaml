  Creates a sweeping or swooshing effect on a sound.
description: |
  The FlangeSoundEffect creates a sweeping or swooshing effect on the Sound or
  SoundGroup it is applied to. It does this by copying the original audio signal
  and playing on top of the original but slightly offset and modulated.

  Like all other `Class.SoundEffect`, a FlangeSoundEffect can be applied either
  to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
