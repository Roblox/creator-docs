      This property is a content-type property that should hold the asset ID of
      a decal or image uploaded to Roblox. It functions identically to
      `Class.Decal.Texture` with regards to loading the image from Roblox. The
      rendered image will be colorized using
      `Class.ImageButton.ImageColor3|ImageColor3`.

      Note that it is possible to make the image render as tiled, scaled to fit,
      or 9-sliced by adjusting the `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType|ScaleType`
      property.

      colorization occurs. This property is very useful for reusing image
      assets: If the source image is completely white with transparency, you can
      set the entire color of the image at once with this property.

      Determines the transparency of the rendered image.
    description: |
      This property determines the alpha of the element's rendered image. A
      value of `0` is completely opaque and a value of `1` is completely
      transparent (invisible). This property behaves similarly to
      `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` or `Class.BasePart.Transparency`.

      If you disable image rendering by setting
      `Class.ImageButton.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency` to `1`, it will
      result in a plain rectangle that can be used as a button. However, it may
      be better to use a blank `Class.TextButton` instead.

    summary: |
      Determines how an image will scale if displayed in a UI element whose size
      differs from the source image.
    description: |
      This property determines in what way the `Class.ImageButton.Image|Image`
      property is rendered when the UI element's absolute size differs from the
      source image's size.

      By default, this property is
      `Enum.ScaleType.Stretch|Enum.ScaleType.Stretch` which will simply
      stretch/compact the image dimensions so it fits the UI element's space
      exactly. Since transparent pixels are set to black when uploading to
      Roblox, transparent images should apply alpha blending to avoid a blackish
      outline around scaled images.

      For `Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, when scaling up, the corners will remain the
      source image size. The edges of the image will stretch to the width/height
      of the image. Finally, the center of the image will stretch to fill the
      center area of the image. To learn more about 9‑sliced images, see
      [UI 9‑Slice Design](../../../ui/9-slice.md).

      For `Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, the size of each image tile is determined by
      the `Class.ImageButton.TileSize|TileSize` property.

    description: |
      Scales the 9-slice edges by the specified ratio. This means that the edges
      around the 9‑slice will grow as if you'd uploaded a new version of the
      texture upscaled. Defaults to `1.0`.

      As a multiplier for the borders of a 9-slice, it is useful for reusing one
      rounded corner image for multiple radii.

      See also `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType|ScaleType` which determines how an
      image will scale if displayed in a UI element whose size differs from the
      source image.

    description: |
      Sets the tiling size of the `Class.ImageButton` starting at the upper-left
      corner of the image. The default `Datatype.UDim2` values are <Typography
      noWrap>`1, 0, 1, 0`</Typography>; the scale components of the
      `Datatype.UDim2` will scale the tile based on the size of the
      `Class.ImageButton` while the offset components are in raw pixels. For
      example, a scale of `0.5` means the tile will be half the size of the
      `Class.ImageButton` in the corresponding axis.

      This property is only active if the
      `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType|ScaleType` property is set to
      `Enum.ScaleType.Tile`.
