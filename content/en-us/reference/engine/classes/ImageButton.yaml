summary: |
  A 2D user interface element that displays an interactive image.
description: |
  An ImageButton behaves similarly to an `Class.ImageLabel` in regards to
  rendering with the additional behaviors of a `Class.GuiButton`. It defines the
  same image-rendering properties as a `Class.ImageLabel` does.

  You can disable image rendering by setting
  `Class.ImageButton.ImageTransparency` to 1. This will leave you with a plain
  rectangle that can be used as a button. However, it may be better to use a
  blank `Class.TextButton` for this.

      The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset
      ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to
      `Class.Decal.Texture` with regards to loading the image from the Roblox
      website. The rendered image will be colorized using
      `Class.ImageButton.ImageColor3`. It is possible to make the image render
      as tiled, scaled to fit, or 9-sliced, by adjusting the
      `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType` property.

      The ImageColor3 property determines how an image is colorized. When set to
      white, no colorization occurs. This property is very useful for reusing
      image assets: If the source image is completely white with transparency,
      you can set the entire color of the image at once with this property.

      By default, the image smooths out the texture when displayed either larger
      or smaller than its size in texture memory. In contrast,
      `Enum.ResamplerMode.Pixelated|Enum.ResamplerMode.Pixelated` preserves the
      sharp edges of the image pixels.

    summary: |
      Determines how an image will scale if displayed in a UI element whose size
      differs from the source image.
    description: |
      The ScaleType property determines in what way an `Class.ImageButton.Image`
      is rendered when the UI element's absolute size differs from the source
      image's size.

      By default, this property is
      `Enum.ScaleType.Stretch|Enum.ScaleType.Stretch`, which will simply
      stretch/compact the image dimensions so it fits the UI element's space
      exactly. Since transparent pixels are set to black when uploading to the
      Roblox website, transparent images should apply alpha blending to avoid a
      blackish outline around scaled images.

      For `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`, the
      `Class.ImageButton.SliceCenter` property will be revealed in the
      Properties window. This is for 9-slice UI: when scaling up, the corners
      will remain the source image size. The edges of the image will stretch to
      the width/height of the image. Finally, the center of the image will
      stretch to fill the center area of the image.

      Finally, for `Enum.ScaleType.Tile|Enum.ScaleType.Tile`, the
      `Class.ImageButton.TileSize` property will be revealed in the Properties
      window. This is for tiled images, where the size of each image tile is
      determined by the `Class.ImageButton.TileSize` property.

      The SliceCenter property sets the slice boundaries of a 9-sliced image
      when `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType` is set to
      `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`. Please note that this
      property is only visible in the Studio Properties Pane if
      `Class.ImageButton.ScaleType` is set to
      `Enum.ScaleType.Slice|Enum.ScaleType.Slice`. Select this property and
      click the "..." button to open the 9-Slice Editor, a built-in visual
      editor for setting the slice boundaries.

      Scales the 9-slice edges by the specified ratio. This means that the edges
      around the 9-slice will grow as if you'd uploaded a new version of the
      texture upscaled. Defaults to 1.0.

      As a multiplier for the borders of a 9-slice, it is useful for reusing one
      rounded corner image for multiple radii

    summary: |
      Sets the tiling scale of the ImageButton.
    description: |
      TileSize sets the tiling size of the ImageButton. The default
      `Datatype.UDim2` values are 1,0,1,0. The scale component of the UDim2 will
      scale the tile based on the size of the ImageButton. The offset is in raw
      pixels. The tiling starts at the upper left-hand corner of the image. For
      example a scale of 0.5 will mean the tile will be half the size of the
      ImageButton (in the corresponding axis).

      This property is only active if the ScaleType for the ImageButton is set
      to Tile instead of Slice or Stretch.
