name: PlayerScripts
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container for LocalScripts to be run on the client.
description: |
  `Class.PlayerScripts` is a container object located inside `Class.Player`
  objects within the `Class.Players` game service. It is created automatically
  when a player joins the game. Its main purpose is to contain
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` copied from the `Class.StarterPlayerScripts`
  container within the `Class.StarterPlayer` game service, which happens once
  upon creation. Descendant `LocalScripts` of `Class.PlayerScripts` will run
  code on the client of the `Class.Player`.

  Unlike the `Class.Backpack` and `Class.PlayerGui` containers, the
  `Class.PlayerScripts` container is not accessible to the server. Server
  `Class.Script` objects will not run when parented to `Class.PlayerScripts`.
