  Records audio streams in-experience.
description: |
  `AudioRecorder` records audio streams in-experience with a fixed time limit of 60 seconds. The
  results can be loaded into an `Class.AudioPlayer` for playback.

  At this time, `Class.AudioDeviceInput` cannot be recorded. The
  `Class.AudioRecorder.GetUnrecordableInstancesAsync()|GetUnrecordableInstancesAsync()` method
  can be used to check specifically which instances aren't recordable.
