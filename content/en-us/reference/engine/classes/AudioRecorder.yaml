  Records audio streams in-experience.
description: |
  **This API is in development and is not available yet.**

  `AudioRecorder` records audio streams in-experience with a fixed time limit of
  60 seconds. The results can be loaded into an `Class.AudioPlayer` for
  playback.

  At this time, `Class.AudioDeviceInput` cannot be recorded. The
  `Class.AudioRecorder:GetUnrecordableInstancesAsync()|GetUnrecordableInstancesAsync()`
  method can be used to check specifically which instances aren't recordable.
