summary: |
  A container object for a single double-precision floating point number.
description: |
  Store a single [Luau number](https://luau.org/syntax#number-literals), defined
  to be
  [double-precision floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format),
  or more commonly known as a **double**. This stores a number in 64 bits (8
  bytes) using the IEEE 754 representation (1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 52
  fractional bits). Maximum and minimum values are
  &PlusMinus;1.7976931348623157e+308, with a range of &PlusMinus;2^53 for exact
  integer representations.

  Like all `Class.ValueBase` objects, this single value is stored in the
  `Class.NumberValue.Value|Value` property. The `Changed` event fires with the
  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

      Fires whenever the `Class.NumberValue.Value` changes. It runs with the new
      value being stored in the argument object, instead of a string
      representing the property being changed.

      Listening for the `Changed` signal can be useful in games that use
      `NumberValues` to track values like leaderboard statistics or item prices.
