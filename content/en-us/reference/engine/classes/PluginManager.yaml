  A singleton class used to create `Class.Plugin|Plugins`. This has been
  superseded by the [Plugins](../../../studio/plugins.md) but it can be used to
  create plugins with the command bar.

  The PluginManager object can be retrieved using the deprecated
  `Class.PluginManager|PluginManager()` function.
