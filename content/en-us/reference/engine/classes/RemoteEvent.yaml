name: RemoteEvent
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object which facilitates asynchronous, one-way communication across the
  client-server boundary. Scripts firing a `Class.RemoteEvent` do not yield.
description: |
  The **RemoteEvent** object facilitates asynchronous, one-way communication
  across the [client-server](../../../projects/client-server.md) boundary
  without yielding for a response. This communication can be directed from one
  client to the server, from the server to a specific client, or from the server
  to all clients.

  In order for both the server and clients to access a `Class.RemoteEvent`
  instance, it must be in a place where both sides can see it, such as
  `Class.ReplicatedStorage`, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it
  in `Class.Workspace` or inside a `Class.Tool`.

  If no connected listener exists to handle an event, you might see a
  `Remote event invocation discarded` error in the log to indicate that the
  event was discarded and that you need to implement either `OnClientEvent` or
  `OnServerEvent`. Unlike `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents`,
  `Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents` buffer a large number of events before
  throwing this error.

  If you need the result of the call, you should use a `Class.RemoteFunction`
  instead. Otherwise a remote event is recommended since it will minimize
  network traffic/latency and won't yield the script to wait for a response.

  See [Remote events and callbacks](../../../scripting/events/remote.md) for
  code samples and further details.

  #### Throttling

  Remote events are subject to rate limits when sent from the client to the
  server with the `Class.RemoteEvent:FireServer()|FireServer()` method.
  `Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents` and
  `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents` both have a limit of
  approximately 500 requests per second, per client. This limit is **shared
  among all remote events of the same type**. To avoid throttling and latency
  issues, limit recurring remote events whenever possible.

  #### Parameter limitations

  Any type of Roblox object (`Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, etc.) can be
  passed as a parameter when a `Class.RemoteEvent` is fired, as well as Luau
  types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should carefully
  explore the
  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/remote.md#argument-limitations).

      Fires the `Class.RemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent` event for each
      connected client. Unlike `Class.RemoteEvent:FireClient()|FireClient()`,
      this event does not take a target `Class.Player` as the first argument,
      since it fires to multiple clients. Since this method is used to
      communicate from the server to clients, it only works when used in a
