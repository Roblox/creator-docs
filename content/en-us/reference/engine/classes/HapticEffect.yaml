summary: ''
description: |
  Modern controllers and devices have motors built‑in to provide haptic
  feedback. Adding rumbles and vibrations can provide subtle feedback that is
  hard to convey through visuals or audio.

  Roblox supports haptics for the following devices:

  - Android and iOS phones supporting haptics including most iPhone, Pixel, and
    Samsung Galaxy devices
  - PlayStation gamepads
  - Xbox gamepads
  - Quest Touch controller

      Fires when the `Class.HapticEffect` has completed playback and stopped.
      Note this event will **not** fire for haptics with
      `Class.HapticEffect.Looped|Looped` set to `true` since they continue
      playing upon reaching the end. This event will also **not** fire when the
      haptic is stopped before playback has completed.

      This event is often used to destroy an `Class.HapticEffect` when it has
      completed playback.
