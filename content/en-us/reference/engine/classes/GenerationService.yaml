  Service that allows developers to generate 3D objects from text prompts.
description: |
  `GenerationService` allows developers to generate 3D objects from text
  prompts. Mesh generation is a two step process:

  1. `Class.GenerationService:GenerateMeshAsync()|GenerateMeshAsync()` starts
     the mesh generation process using a text prompt and other required
     parameters. It returns a unique identifier (generation ID) that can be used
     to retrieve the future result.
  2. `Class.GenerationService:LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()|LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()`
     loads the generated mesh into the experience. The mesh is returned as a
     `Class.MeshPart` or `Class.Model`.

  Currently, `GenerationService` only supports the following usage:

  - `Class.GenerationService:GenerateMeshAsync()|GenerateMeshAsync()` must be
    called from server scripts.
  - `Class.GenerationService:LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()|LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()`
    must be called from client scripts.

  As a result, when a mesh generation request originates from a client, the
  client must send a signal to the server to initiate generation. Once the
  server determines that generation is complete, it should notify the
  appropriate client to call
  `Class.GenerationService:LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()|LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()`
  and retrieve the mesh. Note that since the generated mesh is loaded with
  `Class.EditableMesh` content and only on the client, it is not replicated to
  any other clients.

  The following code samples illustrate this design pattern. See
  [this demo experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/86571743597273/Mesh-Generation-Template)
  for a more detailed example (click the **&ctdot;** button and **Edit in
  Studio**).

      Starts the generation of a new 3D mesh from a text prompt and returns
      unique IDs used to track and retrieve the result. You can optionally
      receive intermediate results, such as the untextured mesh, by providing an
      `intermediateResultCallback` function. After the generation is complete,
      use
      `Class.GenerationService:LoadGeneratedMeshAsync|LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()`
      to load and display the generated mesh.

            guide for the generated asset. The service will attempt to create a
            model with a size and proportion similar to the provided
