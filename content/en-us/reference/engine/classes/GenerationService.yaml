summary: |
  Service that allows developers to generate 3D objects from text prompts.
description: |
  `GenerationService` enables you to generate 3D objects from text prompts using
  Roblox's Cube 3D foundation model. This enables the generation of objects like
  environmental props in-experience, as well as fully functional models like
  vehicles that drive, planes that fly, and weapons that shoot.

      Starts the generation of a new 3D mesh from a text prompt and returns
      unique IDs used to track and retrieve the result. Must be called from
      server scripts. You can optionally receive intermediate results, such as
      the untextured mesh, by providing an `intermediateResultCallback`
      function.

      After the generation is complete, use
      `Class.GenerationService:LoadGeneratedMeshAsync|LoadGeneratedMeshAsync()`
      to load and display the generated mesh.

    parameters:
      - name: inputs

        default:
        summary: |
          A dictionary containing the mesh generation prompts. Currently, the
          only supported key is the `Prompt` (string) that describes the mesh to
          generate.
      - name: player
        type: Player
        default:
        summary: |
          The `Class.Player` requesting the generation.
      - name: options
        type: Dictionary
        default:
        summary: |
          A dictionary for additional generation options to influence the
          result. The optional `SuggestedSize` key (`Datatype.Vector3`)
          represents a size guide for the generated asset, meaning
          `GenerationService` will attempt to create a model with a size and
          proportion similar to the provided `Datatype.Vector3`, although there
          is no guarantee on the final output size.
      - name: intermediateResultCallback
        type: Function?
        default:
        summary: |
          A callback function triggered with intermediate generation results.
          Useful for retrieving early mesh versions before textures are applied.
    returns:
      - type: Tuple
        summary: |
          A tuple of the generation ID (a unique ID returned for each invocation
          of `GenerateMeshAsync()`) and context ID (not currently used).

      Enables generation of multi-mesh geometries according to provided `inputs`
      and a `schema`.

      This method throws an error during the generation process for issues like
      prompt rejection, generation timeouts, `schema` mismatches, or backend
      service errors. It's recommended to wrap it in a
      `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` to catch such errors.

      See [this guide](../../../parts/model-generation.md) for more detailed
      examples including usage of a `Behaviors` module to connect functional
      behaviors to generated models.

    parameters:
      - name: inputs
        type: Dictionary
        default:
        summary: |
          A table representing conditioning inputs with the following keys:

          - `TextPrompt` — String description of the object to generate.
          - `Size` — Optional `Datatype.Vector3` describing the object size to
            generate. This is only approximate; scale the model extents
            post‑generation if you need a specific size.
          - `MaxTriangles` — Optional integer describing the maximum number of
            triangles that the returned model will contain. Lower values result
            in more faceted and low-poly generations.
          - `GenerateTextures` — `true` (default) textures the resulting
            generation, while `false` will not generate textures.
      - name: schema
        type: Dictionary
        default:
        summary: |
          Table representing the generation schema. Must contain a
          `PredefinedSchema` key with a string value; current valid options are
          `Car5` for a basic vehicle chassis consisting of five
          `Class.Model|Models`, or `Body1` which results in a single mesh
          output.

        type: Dictionary?
        default:
        summary: |
          Currently not used; reserved for future customization options.
    returns:
      - type: Tuple
        summary: |
          Tuple with the following elements:

          - A standard `Class.Model` container instance that is compliant with
            the specified `schema`.
          - A table containing a UUID and other metadata about the generation.

      Retrieves and loads a mesh generated by

      the provided `generationId`. Must be called from client scripts.

      The mesh can be returned as a `Class.MeshPart` or `Class.Model`. Because
      editable meshes are not replicated, the loaded mesh is not replicated to
      any other clients and can only be loaded once per `generationId`.
