  A container for objects to be copied to a Player's PlayerScripts when they
  join a game.
description: |
  The StarterPlayerScripts is a container object located within the
  `Class.StarterPlayer` service. It contains `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`
  and other objects to be copied to the `Class.PlayerScripts` container once
  when a `Class.Player` joins the game. For example, if you want to create
  special effects on the client when certain conditions are met, you can place a
  `Class.LocalScript` within this object to do that.

  This object is also a good place for `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` that
  define additional inputs with `Class.ContextActionService`. For inputs that
  are only relevant when a player has spawned in, you can use
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()` when the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`
  character spawns. Then, use `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()` when
  they die or despawn.

  When a game is run, this object will also house the default multi-platform
  Roblox control scripts for the camera and character. If
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` named "CameraScript" or "ControlScript" are
  placed within this folder, they will **replace** the Roblox defaults for those
  scripts respectively. You can add empty LocalScripts for each of these to
  simply disable them altogether. This is useful for games that do not follow
  the usual control paradigms of a 3rd person game.
