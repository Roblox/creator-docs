  A container for objects to be copied to a Player's PlayerScripts when they
  join a game.
description: |
  `Class.StarterPlayerScripts` is a container object located within the
  `Class.StarterPlayer` service. It can contain `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`
  and other objects to be copied to the `Class.PlayerScripts` container once
  when a `Class.Player` joins the game. For example, if you want to create
  special effects on the client when certain conditions are met, you can place a
  `Class.LocalScript` within this container to do that.

  When an experience is run, this object will also house the default
  multi-platform Roblox control scripts for the camera and character. If
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` named `CameraScript` or `ControlScript` are
  placed within this container, they will **replace** the Roblox defaults for
  those scripts respectively. If desired, you can add empty
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` for each of these to disable them altogether;
  this is useful for experiences that do not follow the typical control
  paradigms of a Roblox experience.
