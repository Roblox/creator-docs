  A Keyframe holds the `Class.Pose|Poses` applied to joints in a `Class.Model`
  at a given point of time in an animation. `Class.Keyframe|Keyframes` are
  interpolated between during animation playback.

  Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate
  `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences` as the animation editor covers most
  animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to
  generate an animation from a `Class.Script` or build their own plugin.

  ## Structure

  Keyframes are held within a `Class.KeyframeSequence` and contain `Class.Pose`
  objects. The poses are named in accordance with the `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
  they correspond to and are structured in terms of joint hierarchy. This means
  each `Class.Pose` is parented to the `Class.Pose` corresponding to the part it
  is attached to. See below for a visual example.

  Note, as `Class.Pose|Poses` are named in accordance with the
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` they correspond to, animations require distinct
  part names to play correctly.

  ## Interpolation

  During animation playback the poses in different keyframes are interpolated
  between. This allows a smooth animation to be created without needing to
  define every frame. Note, the style of interpolation is determined in the
  `Class.Pose` object. The Keyframe object merely holds the `Class.Pose|Poses`
  at a defined point of time in the animation (`Class.Keyframe.Time`).

      Note the `Class.Keyframe` with the highest time value in a
      `Class.KeyframeSequence` is used to determine the length of the animation.

      Adds a `Class.KeyframeMarker` to the `Class.Keyframe` by parenting it to
      the keyframe.
    description: |
      This function adds a `Class.KeyframeMarker` to the `Class.Keyframe` by
      parenting it to the keyframe. It is functionally identical to setting the
      marker's `Class.Instance.Parent` to the Keyframe.

      Note, this function will not error when an instance other than a
      KeyframeMarker is given as the parameter and will parent it successfully.

      #### More about Keyframes

      `Class.Keyframe` names do not need to be unique. For example, if an
      Animation has three keyframes named "Particles" the connected event
      returned by `Class.AnimationTrack:GetMarkerReachedSignal()` will fire each
      time one of these keyframes is reached.

      `Class.Keyframe` names can be set in the Roblox Animation Editor when
      creating or editing an animation. They cannot however be set by a
      `Class.Script` on an existing animation prior to playing it.
