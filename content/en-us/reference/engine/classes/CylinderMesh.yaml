  ## What does a CylinderMesh do?

  A CylinderMesh gives the `Class.BasePart` it was applied to a cylinder shaped
  mesh.

  The mesh applied gives the same appearance as that due to the
  `Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType` of a `Class.SpecialMesh` being set to 'Cylinder'
  or `Class.Part.Shape` being set to 'Cylinder'. However, unlike those two
  cases, it is orientated so that the height of the cylinder is along the
  `Class.BasePart` Y axis.

  The dimensions of the mesh scale relative to the `Class.BasePart.Size` of the
  `Class.BasePart`. This scale is uniformly along the `Class.BasePart` Y axis
  and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the part's X and Z axis, using the lowest
  value. This means the `Class.BasePart` can be resized normally, but the cross
  section of the cylinder will always remain a circle and cannot be stretched or
  compressed.

  Note as the CylinderMesh object does not include a texture the
  `Class.DataModelMesh.VertexColor` property does not do anything.

  ## Why use a CylinderMesh?

  The advantage of using a mesh over setting the `Class.Part.Shape` property of
  a part to 'Cylinder' is that the `Class.DataModelMesh.Scale` and
  `Class.DataModelMesh.Offset` properties are exposed. These allow the position
  and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing
  the `Class.BasePart.Position` or `Class.BasePart.Size` of the `Class.Part` the
  mesh is parented to.

  The key difference between a CylinderMesh or a `Class.SpecialMesh` with
  `Class.SpecialMesh.MeshType` set to 'Cylinder' is the orientation of the
  cylinder mesh. With a CylinderMesh, the height of the cylinder is aligned with
  the height (Y axis) of the part. With a `Class.SpecialMesh` (or `Class.Part`
  with `Class.Part.Shape` set to 'Cylinder'), the height of the cylinder is
  aligned with the X axis.
