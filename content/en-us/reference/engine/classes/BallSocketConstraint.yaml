name: BallSocketConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Forces its two attachments into the same position and allows them to freely
  rotate about all three axes, with optional limits to restrict both tilt and
  twist.
description: |
  A `BallSocketConstraint` constrains its `Class.Attachment|Attachments` so that
  they occupy the same position. By default it allows both attachments to freely
  rotate about all of their axes, but if
  `Class.BallSocketConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` is `true`, the
  attachments can only rotate in a limited cone.

  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**)
  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not
  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Limits

  You can set limits to restrict both **tilt** and **twist** of a ball socket,
  similar to how a human's head can tilt and turn within a limited axial range.
  Enabling the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property
  exposes the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.UpperAngle|UpperAngle` value to
  restrict **tilt** within a cone; it also exposes the
  `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistLimitsEnabled|TwistLimitsEnabled` property
  which, when enabled, lets you restrict **twist** rotation through the
  `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistLowerAngle|TwistLowerAngle` and
  `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistUpperAngle|TwistUpperAngle` limits.
