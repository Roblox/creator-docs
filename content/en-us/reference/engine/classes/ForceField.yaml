  A `Class.ForceField` protects a `Class.Humanoid` from taking damage using the
  `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` function, and protects `Class.BasePart`s from
  having their joints broken due to an `Class.Explosion`.

  ## ForceField Creation

  ForceFields are created when a character spawns on a `Class.SpawnLocation` and
  the `Class.SpawnLocation.Duration` property is greater than zero.

  ForceFields influence the instance they are parented to. When parented to a
  `Class.Model` they will protect all of the `Class.BasePart`s descending from
  that model. They may be parented to a `Class.BasePart`, but the part's joints
  will only be protected if both the part and the part it is connected to also
  contain ForceField.

  ## Forcefields and Joints

  When a ForceField is parented to a character `Class.Model` the neck joint will
  be protected and thus the character can not be killed by `Explosions`.
  Developers can protect joints from Explosions without the need for a
  `Class.ForceField` object by setting
  `Class.Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent` to 0.

  **ForceFields and Damage**

  ForceFields only protect `Class.Humanoid`s from damage using the
  `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` function. Humanoids can still be damaged by
  setting `Class.Humanoid.Health` directly. For this reason, it is advised that
  developers use `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()`. Bearing in mind of course, that
  it is still possible to check if a `Class.ForceField` exists before manually
  setting the humanoid's health as shown below:

      if not characterModel:FindFirstChildOfClass("ForceField") then
      	humanoid.Health = humanoid.Health - 10
      end

  ## ForceField Visuals

  When `Class.ForceField.Visible` is set to true, a particle effect is created.
  A number of rules determine where this effect will be emitted from.

  When parented to a `Class.Model`, if the model includes a `Class.Humanoid`
  named "Humanoid" with `Class.Humanoid.RigType` set to R15, the effect will be
  emitted from the part named "UpperTorso". Otherwise, the effect will be
  emitted from the part named "Torso". The part must have the same parent as the
  ForceField, if it does not exist then the effect is emitted at 0, 0, 0.

  When parented to a `Class.BasePart` the effect will be emitted from the part's
  `Class.BasePart.Position`.

      0, 0.

      When parented to a `Class.BasePart` the effect will be emitted from the
      part's `Class.BasePart.Position`.

      One use for this property is replacing the default particle effect with a
      custom effect using `Class.ParticleEmitter`s.
