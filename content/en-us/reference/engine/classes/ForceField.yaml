  A **ForceField** protects a `Class.Humanoid` from taking damage dealt through
  the `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` method and protects
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` from having their joints broken due to an
  `Class.Explosion`. A new **ForceField** is created when a character spawns on
  a `Class.SpawnLocation` and the `Class.SpawnLocation.Duration` property is
  greater than zero.

  #### Damage and Joints

  A **ForceField** influences the instance it's parented to. When parented to a
  `Class.Model`, it protects all of the `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` descending
  from that model. If parented to a `Class.BasePart`, the part's joints will
  only be protected if both the part and the part it's connected to also contain
  a **ForceField**.

  **ForceField** only protects `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` from damage dealt by
  the `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` method. Humanoids can still be damaged by
  setting `Class.Humanoid.Health` directly. For this reason, it's advised that
  you use `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()` to assign damage while accounting for
  force field protection.

  #### Visualization

  When `Class.ForceField.Visible` is set to true, a particle effect is created.
  A number of rules determine where this effect will be emitted from:

  - When parented to a `Class.Model`, if the model includes a `Class.Humanoid`
    named **Humanoid** with `Class.Humanoid.RigType` set to R15, the effect will
    be emitted from the part named **UpperTorso**. Otherwise, the effect will be
    emitted from the part named **Torso**.
  - When parented to a `Class.BasePart` the effect will be emitted from the
    part's `Class.BasePart.Position`.

      Determines whether or not the `Class.ForceField` particle effect is
      visible. Setting this to `false` lets you replace the default particle
      effect with a custom effect as demonstrated in the following code sample.
