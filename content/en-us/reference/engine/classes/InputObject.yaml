name: InputObject
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object created when an input begins that describes a particular user input.
description: |
  An `InputObject` represents a single user input, such as mouse movement,
  touches, key presses and more. It is created when an input begins.

  The properties of this object vary according the
  `Class.InputObject.UserInputType|UserInputType`. Each kind of input will
  undergo various changes to its
  `Class.InputObject.UserInputState|UserInputState`. During the lifetime of an
  input, other properties which further describe the input may change, such as
  `Class.InputObject.Position|Position` and `Class.InputObject.Delta|Delta`.
  Keyboard and gamepad button presses will have the
  `Class.InputObject.KeyCode|KeyCode` property set.

  Once created at the beginning of an input, the same object persists and is
  updated until the input ends. As a result, you can track the object's changes
  using the `Class.Object.Changed|Changed` event as the user changes the input
  in question. You can also place these objects into a list of active inputs
  track and interact with the object after it's creation by an event such as
  `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan`. This is mostly useful for touch events,
  as each touch point will have a separate `InputObject`.

  See also `Class.UserInputService` whose events and functions often use
  `InputObject`, and `Class.GuiObject` whose events related to user input use
  `InputObject`.

      A `Datatype.Vector3` describing the delta between input movements.
    description: |
      A `Datatype.Vector3` describing the delta (change) between input
      movements.

      This is useful when used with the input's
      `Class.InputObject.Position|Position` to track the position and movement
      of the user's input, such as when you're creating custom movement or
      camera scripts. Consider tracking input object changes using the
      `Class.Object.Changed` event or when user input changes via events such as
      `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged` and `Class.GuiObject.InputChanged`.

      Note that an `Class.InputObject` corresponding to
      `Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton1` (left click) and
      `Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton2` (right click) supplied from an
      `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan|InputBegan` callback will not have its
      `Class.InputObject.Delta|Delta` or `Class.InputObject.Position|Position`
      updated once created, except for when the mouse input ends. In order to
      get updated deltas for mouse inputs, you must instead reference an
      `Class.InputObject` from an
      `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged|InputChanged` callback, or call
      `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()|GetMouseDelta()`. However, any
      `Class.InputObject|InputObjects` corresponding to touch inputs will have
      their delta and position updated every frame throughout their lifetime.

    description: |
      A `Datatype.Vector3` describing the positional value of this input.

      For mouse and touch input, this is the screen position of the mouse/touch,
      described in the **X** and **Y** components. The inset applied to GUI
      elements (such as from the top bar) is accounted for in the position. For
      the mouse wheel input, the **Z** component describes whether the wheel was
      moved forward (`1`), backwards (`-1`), or not at all (`0`).

      Note that an `Class.InputObject` corresponding to
      `Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton1` (left click) and
      `Enum.UserInputType.MouseButton2` (right click) supplied from an
      `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan|InputBegan` callback will not have its
      `Class.InputObject.Delta|Delta` or `Class.InputObject.Position|Position`
      updated once created, except for when the mouse input ends. In order to
      get updated positions for mouse inputs, you must instead reference an
      `Class.InputObject` from an
      `Class.UserInputService.InputChanged|InputChanged` callback, or call
      `Class.UserInputService:GetMouseLocation()|GetMouseLocation()`. However,
      any `Class.InputObject|InputObjects` corresponding to touch inputs will
      have their delta and position updated every frame throughout their
      lifetime.
