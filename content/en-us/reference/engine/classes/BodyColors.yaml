  BodyColors is a utility object used by Roblox to load avatar body colors from
  the website. Avatars that are loaded from the website will automatically have
  a BodyColors object corresponding to said avatar's body color configuration.
  When parented inside of a character with a `Class.Humanoid`, it will apply the
  colors to each specified limb.
