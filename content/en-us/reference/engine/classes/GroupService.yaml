  `GroupService` is a service that allows developers to fetch information about
  a Roblox group from within a game.

  Basic information on the group, including its name, description, owner, roles
  and emblem can be fetched using `Class.GroupService:GetGroupInfoAsync()`.
  Lists of a group's allies and enemies can be fetched using
  `Class.GroupService:GetAlliesAsync()` and
  `Class.GroupService:GetEnemiesAsync()`.

  `GroupService` can also be used to fetch a list of groups a player is a member
  of, using `Class.GroupService:GetGroupsAsync()`. If you wish to verify if a
  player is in a group, use the `Class.Player:IsInGroupAsync()` method rather
  than `Class.GroupService:GetGroupsAsync()`.

  The service has a number of useful applications, such as detecting if a player
  is an ally or enemy upon joining the game, or prompting a player to join a
  group using the `Class.GroupService:PromptJoinAsync()` method.

      Returns a `Class.StandardPages` object including information on all of the
      specified group's allies.

      This pages does not include a list of group IDs but instead a list of
      group information tables, mirroring the format of those returned by
      `Class.GroupService:GetGroupInfoAsync()`. See below for the structure of
      these tables.

      ```lua

          Name = "Knights of the Seventh Sanctum",
          Id = 377251,
          Owner = {

      Note, as this function returns a `Class.StandardPages` object rather than
      an array, developers may wish to convert it to an array for ease of use
      (see examples).

      This function has a number of useful applications, including detecting if
      a player is a member of an allied group.

      For enemies, use `Class.GroupService:GetEnemiesAsync()`.

      The table returned is the same format as that returned in

      Note, if a group has no owner the Owner field will be set to `nil`.

      This function has a number of useful applications, including loading the
      latest description and logo of a group for display in a group base.

      **Warning:** The **IsInClan** property in the returned table will always
      return **false** and exists for backwards compatibility. The Clans feature
      was sunset from the Roblox platform in 2016.

      This function returns a list of tables containing information on all of
      the groups a given `Class.Player` is a member of.

      The list returned will include an entry for every group the player is a
      member of. These entries are tables with the following fields.

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Description</th>
      		</tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>EmblemId</b></td>
        <td>The assetId of the emblem, the same which is used in the EmblemUrl</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>The rankId the player has (for example: 255 for the owner)</td>
      </tr>

        <td>A boolean indicating if this is the player's primary group</td>
      </tr>

      Note unlike `Class.GroupService:GetAlliesAsync()` and
      `Class.GroupService:GetEnemiesAsync()`, GetGroupsAsync returns a table
      rather than a `Class.StandardPages` object.

          `Class.Player` is a member of.

      native modal.
    description: |
      `PromptJoinAsync()` displays a prompt to the local player through which
      they may join the specified Roblox group. The group must exist and the
      player must meet the eligibility criteria to join. If the player is
      ineligible, this method will return `Enum.GroupMembershipStatus.None`.

      Note that you can use `Class.Player:IsInGroupAsync()` to check the
      player's current membership status before calling this method.

          group ID.
    returns:

        summary: |
          `Enum.GroupMembershipStatus` indicating the player's group membership
          status after the prompt is closed. If the player closes the prompt
          without joining, this will return `Enum.GroupMembershipStatus.None` or
          their previous status if they were already a member.
