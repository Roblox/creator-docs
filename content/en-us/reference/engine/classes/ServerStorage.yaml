description: |
  A container whose contents are only accessible on the server. Objects
  descending from ServerStorage will not replicate to the client and will not be
  accessible from `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`.

  As ServerStorage is a service it can only be accessed using the
  `Class.DataModel.GetService` method.

  By storing large objects such as maps in ServerStorage until they are needed,
  network traffic will not be used up transmitting these objects to the client
  when they join the game.

  `Class.Script|Scripts` will not run when they are parented to ServerStorage,
  although `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` contained within can be accessed
  and ran. It is recommended developers use `Class.ServerScriptService` to hold
  `Class.Script|Scripts` they wish the server to execute.

  Note that as the contents of ServerStorage can only be accessed by the server,
  its contents will need to be parented elsewhere (such as `Class.Workspace`)
  before clients can access them. Developers who require a container that is
  accessible by both the server and client are advised to use
  `Class.ReplicatedStorage` instead.
