name: AlignPosition
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Constraint which applies force to move two attachments together, or to move
  one attachment to a goal position.
description: |
  The `AlignPosition` constraint applies force to move two attachments together,
  or to move one attachment to a goal position. As indicated by the name, it
  only affects the **position** of the attachments, not their orientation (to
  align attachments by **orientation**, see `Class.AlignOrientation`).

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Force Location

  By default, force is applied to the parent of
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` at that attachment's location,
  meaning that if the parent's center of mass is not aligned with the direction
  of the force, torque will be applied as well as force. Alternatively, force
  can be applied to the parents' center of mass by toggling on
  `Class.AlignPosition.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass`.

  #### Reactionary Force

  By default, the constraint only applies force to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` while
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` remains unaffected. If desired,
  force can be applied to both attachments in **equal and opposite directions**
  by enabling `Class.AlignPosition.ReactionForceEnabled|ReactionForceEnabled`.

  #### Force Limits

  You can configure this constraint to apply the maximum force that constraints
  allow through the `Class.AlignPosition.RigidityEnabled|RigidityEnabled`
  property. When `true`, the physics solver reacts as quickly as possible to
  complete the alignment. When `false`, the force applied by the constraint is
  limited based on `Class.AlignPosition.ForceLimitMode|ForceLimitMode`,
  `Class.AlignPosition.MaxVelocity|MaxVelocity`, and
  `Class.AlignPosition.Responsiveness|Responsiveness`. See
  `Class.AlignPosition.ForceLimitMode|ForceLimitMode` for further details.

  #### Attachment Mode

  This constraint can use either **one** or **two** attachments in calculating
  its goal. See `Class.AlignPosition.Mode|Mode` for details.

      be limited by `Class.AlignPosition.MaxAxesForce|MaxAxesForce`. The axes
      along which the force will be limited are based on the
