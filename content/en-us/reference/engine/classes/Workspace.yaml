summary: |
  **Workspace** houses 3D objects which are rendered to the 3D world. Objects
  not descending from it will not be rendered or physically interact with the
  world.
description: |
  The core job of `Class.Workspace` is to hold objects that exist in the 3D
  world, effectively `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`. While such objects are descendant of
  `Class.Workspace`, they will be active. For `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, this
  means they will be rendered, and physically interact with other parts and the
  world. For `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, this means that objects adorned to
  them, such as `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, `Class.Beam|Beams`,
  and `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`, will render.

  Understanding this behavior is important, as it means objects can be removed
  from **Workspace** when they are not needed. For example, map
  `Class.Model|Models` can be removed from the `Class.Workspace` when a
  different map is being played on. Objects that are not immediately needed in
  the 3D world are generally stored in `Class.ReplicatedStorage` or
  `Class.ServerStorage`.

  In its role as the holder of active 3D objects, `Class.Workspace` includes a
  number of useful functions related to parts, their positions, and joints
  between them.

  #### Accessing the Workspace

  `Class.Workspace` can be accessed several ways, all of which are valid.

  - `workspace`
  - `game.Workspace`
  - `game:GetService("Workspace")`

  #### Notes

  - Objects that require adornment, such as
    `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters` and
    `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`, will be at the 0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0
    position when parented to `Class.Workspace` without an adornee otherwise
    being set.
  - The `Class.Model:MakeJoints()` and `Class.Model:BreakJoints()` methods
    inherited from the `Class.Model` class are overridden by
    `Class.Workspace:MakeJoints()` and `Class.Workspace:BreakJoints()` which can
    only be used in plugins.
  - It is impossible to delete `Class.Workspace`.
  - `Class.Workspace` automatically cleans up `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that
    fall beneath
    `Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight|FallenPartsDestroyHeight`.
  - A client's current `Class.Camera` object can be accessed using the
    `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` property.
  - The `Class.Terrain` object can be accessed using the
    `Class.Workspace.Terrain` property.

      The air density at ground level, used in the aerodynamic force model.
    description: |
      The ground level (**Y** of 0) air density in RMU/stud&sup3; units (see
      [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md)), used to calculate the
      aerodynamic force if `Class.Workspace.FluidForces` is
      `Enum.FluidForces|Experimental`. The default corresponds to realistic sea
      level air density at standard temperature and pressure. Air density decays
      as the **Y** altitude increases, reaching 5% of its ground level value at
      100,000 studs. Below **Y** of 0, the air density is fixed at the input
      value.

    description: |
      This `Class.Workspace` property determines whether assets created by other
      uses can be sold in the game.

      #### What are third party sales?

      When this value is false, as it is by default, only assets created by the
      place creator (be it a player or a group) and Roblox can be sold using
      `Class.MarketplaceService`.

      In most cases, games do not need to sell third party assets. However, some
      games such as trade hangouts require this feature and therefore it exists
      as an opt-in option.

      #### What third party products can I sell?

      Note,
      [developer products](../../../production/monetization/developer-products.md)
      can only be sold in the game they are associated with, regardless of what
      AllowThirdPartySales is set to. This property affects
      [Game Passes](../../../production/monetization/game-passes.md) and
      [clothing](../../../art/accessories/classic-clothing.md).

      will begin to throttle. The throttler calculates throttling intensity

      #### How to use CurrentCamera

      This property can be set. When it is set, all other `Class.Camera` objects
      in the `Class.Workspace` are destroyed, including the previous
      CurrentCamera. If this property is set to nil, or the CurrentCamera is
      otherwise destroyed, a new `Class.Camera` will be created and assigned.
      Developers should avoid setting this property to nil or destroying the
      CurrentCamera however as it can have unintended consequences.

      When looking for a client's `Class.Camera` object, developers should use
      this property rather than looking for a child of `Class.Workspace` named
      'Camera'.

      #### What can be done with CurrentCamera

      Accessing a client's current `Class.Camera` object brings a range of uses.

      - Manipulating the viewport using the `Class.Camera` functions
      - Objects parented to the `Class.Camera` will not replicate to the server,
        regardless of what `Class.Workspace.FilteringEnabled` is set to. Prior
        to `Class.Workspace.FilteringEnabled`, this was the main way to render
        `Class.BasePart`s on one client only.

      Below is an example of how this property can be used to access the
      `Class.Camera` object and increase its `Class.Camera.FieldOfView`.

      ```
      workspace.CurrentCamera.FieldOfView = 100
      ```

      The amount of time, in seconds, that the game has been running.

      Despite the title, this value is currently not 'Distributed' across the
      client and the server. Instead, on the server it represents how long the
      server has been running. On the client, it represents how long the client
      has been connected to the server.

      Developers should not rely on the above behavior, and it is possible this
      property will be synchronized across clients and the server in the future.

      Those looking for the time since the program started running should use
      the 'time' function instead. See below for a comparison between
      DistributedGameTime and its alternatives.

      ```
      print(workspace.DistributedGameTime)  --> Time the game started running
      print(os.time())  --> Time since epoch (1 January 1970, 00:00:00) UTC
      print(tick())  --> Time since epoch (1 January 1970, 00:00:00) system time
      print(time())  --> Time the game started running
      print(elapsedTime())  --> Time since Roblox started running

    description: |
      This property determines the height at which the Roblox engine
      automatically removes falling `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and their
      ancestor `Class.Model|Models` from `Class.Workspace` by parenting them to
      `nil`. This is to prevent parts that have fallen off the map from
      continuing to fall forever.

      If a part removed due to this behavior is the last part in a
      `Class.Model`, that model will also be removed. This applies to all model
      ancestors of the part.

      This property is clamped between -50,000 and 50,000 because
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` do not simulate or render properly at a great
      distance from the origin due to floating point inaccuracies.

      This property can be read by scripts, but can only be set by plugins, the
      command bar, or the properties window in Studio.

      #### Sleeping vs Awake Parts

      In order to ensure good performance, Roblox sets `BaseParts` in which
      physics are not being applied to a 'sleeping' state. `Class.BasePart`s
      with `Class.BasePart.Anchored` set to true, for example, will always be
      sleeping as physics doesn't apply to them. When a force is applied to a
      non anchored `Class.BasePart`, an 'awake' state will be applied. Whilst a
      `Class.BasePart` is awake the Roblox physics engine will perform
      continuous calculations to ensure physical forces interact correctly with
      the part. Once the `Class.BasePart` is no longer subject to physical
      forces, it will revert to a 'sleeping' state.

    description: |
      Returns an integer, between 0 and 100, representing the percentage of
      real-time that physics simulation is currently being throttled to.

      This function can be used to determine whether, and to what degree,
      physics throttling is occurring.

      #### What is physics throttling?

      Physics throttling occurs when the physics engine detects it cannot keep
      up with the game in realtime. When physics is being throttled, it will
      update less frequently causing `Class.BasePart`s to appear to move slower.

      Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out
      of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other
      undesirable behavior.

      Objects associated with `Class.Humanoid`s are exempt from physics
      throttling.

      See also `Class.Workspace:SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled()`.

      #### Demonstrating physics throttling

      Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics
      engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to
      simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only
      create a lot of `Class.Part`s very quickly.

      ```
      local i = 0
      while true do
      	i = i + 1
      	if i % 5 == 0 then
      		task.wait()

      #### Using GetRealPhysicsFPS to combat exploiters

      A common use of this function is to detect if exploiters are increasing
      their local physics frame rate to move faster. This is generally done by
      comparing the result returned by a client's GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum
      that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If
      this limit is breached, developers can use the `Class.Player:Kick()`
      function to remove that `Class.Player` from the game. It is important to
      remember that, although this practice may be effective sometimes,
      client-side anti-exploiter measures are never 100% reliable.

      than 1.006&times; speed and no slower than 0.994&times; speed.

      This function is useful for creating synchronized experiences, as it has
      three properties necessary for doing so: it's a real-world time clock,
      it's monotonic, and it has decent precision.

      This function relies on the server, so calling it from a client that isn't
      connected will throw an error.

      This function creates joints between the specified `Class.BasePart|Parts`
      and any touching parts depending on the parts' surfaces and the specified
      joint creation mode.

      This function creates joints between the specified Parts and any planar
      touching surfaces, depending on the parts' surfaces and the specified
      joint creation mode.

      - Glue, Studs, Inlets, Universal, Weld, and Smooth surfaces will all
        create Weld instances.
      - Spheres will not surface-weld to anything. The rounded sides of
        cylinders will not surface-weld, but the flat end sides will.
      - Hinge and Motor surfaces will still create `Class.Rotate` and
        `Class.RotateP` joint instances, regardless of part shape.

      The first parameter is an array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`. Joints will
      only be created between the parts in the array and not in the array.
      Joints will not be created between the parts in the array.

      The second parameter is a `Enum.JointCreationMode` that determines how
      joints will be created. Passing in either enum value,
      `Enum.JointCreationMode|Enum.JointCreationMode.All` or
      `Enum.JointCreationMode|Enum.JointCreationMode.Surface`, has the same
      behavior which equates to Join Always

      This function is used by the Roblox Studio Move tool when the user
      finishes moving a selection. In conjunction with
      `Class.Plugin:GetJoinMode()` and `Class.Workspace:UnjoinFromOutsiders()`
      it can be used to retain join functionality when developing custom studio
      build tools. See the snippets below for an example.

      ```lua

      adjacent parts.

      Joints will be created between the specified Parts and any planar touching
      surfaces, depending on the parts' surfaces.

      - Smooth surfaces will not create joints
      - Glue surfaces will create a `Class.Glue` joint
      - Weld will create a `Class.Weld` joint with any surface except for
        Unjoinable
      - Studs, Inlet, or Universal will each create a `Class.Snap` joint with
        either of other the other two surfaces (e.g. Studs with Inlet and
        Universal)
      - Hinge and Motor surfaces create `Class.Rotate` and `Class.RotateV` joint
        instances

      Unlike `Class.Model:MakeJoints()`, this function requires an array of
      parts as a parameter. This array is given as follows:

      ```
      workspace:MakeJoints({part1, part2, part3})
      ```

      Joints are broken if enough force is applied to them due to an
      `Class.Explosion`, unless a `Class.ForceField` object is parented to the
      `Class.BasePart` or ancestor `Class.Model`. For this reason, they are
      often used to make simple destructible buildings and other models.
