name: Workspace
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  **Workspace** houses 3D objects which are rendered to the 3D world. Objects
  not descending from it will not be rendered or physically interact with the
  world.
description: |
  The core job of `Class.Workspace` is to hold objects that exist in the 3D
  world, effectively `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`. While such objects are descendant of
  `Class.Workspace`, they will be active. For `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, this
  means they will be rendered, and physically interact with other parts and the
  world. For `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, this means that objects adorned to
  them, such as `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, `Class.Beam|Beams`,
  and `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`, will render.

  Understanding this behavior is important, as it means objects can be removed
  from `Class.Workspace` when they are not needed. For example, map
  `Class.Model|Models` can be removed when a different map is being played on.
  Objects that are not immediately needed in the 3D world are generally stored
  in `Class.ReplicatedStorage` or `Class.ServerStorage`.

  In its role as the holder of active 3D objects, `Class.Workspace` includes a
  number of useful functions related to parts, their positions, and joints
  between them.

  ##### Accessing the Workspace

  `Class.Workspace` can be accessed several ways, all of which are valid.

  - `workspace`
  - `game:GetService("Workspace")`
  - `game.Workspace`

  ##### Notes

  - Objects that require adornment, such as
    `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters` and
    `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`, will be at the
    <Typography noWrap>`(0, 0, 0)`</Typography> position when parented to
    `Class.Workspace` without an adornee otherwise being set.
  - The `Class.Model:MakeJoints()` and `Class.Model:BreakJoints()` methods
    inherited from the `Class.Model` class are overridden by
    `Class.Workspace:MakeJoints()` and `Class.Workspace:BreakJoints()` which can
    only be used in plugins.
  - It is impossible to delete `Class.Workspace`.
  - `Class.Workspace` automatically cleans up `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that
    fall beneath
    `Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight|FallenPartsDestroyHeight`.
  - A client's current `Class.Camera` object can be accessed using the
    `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` property.
  - The `Class.Terrain` object can be accessed using the
    `Class.Workspace.Terrain` property.

      The air density at ground level, used in the aerodynamic force model.
    description: |
      The ground level (**Y** of 0) air density in RMU/stud&sup3; units (see
      [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md)), used to calculate the
      aerodynamic force if `Class.Workspace.FluidForces` is
      `Enum.FluidForces|Experimental`. The default corresponds to realistic sea
      level air density at standard temperature and pressure. Air density decays
      as the **Y** altitude increases, reaching 5% of its ground level value at
      100,000 studs. Below **Y** of 0, the air density is fixed at the input
      value.

    description: |
      Controls the intensity of turbulence by determining the magnitude of
      fluctuations in wind velocities. Ranges from `0` to `1`, with a value of
      `0` disabling turbulence and a value of `1` providing the most intense
      turbulence. The values of `AirTurbulenceIntensity` roughly correspond to
      the following levels:

      - `(0, 0.4]`: Low intensity turbulence
      - `(0.4, 0.7]`: Moderate intensity turbulence
      - `(0.7, 1]`: High intensity turbulence

      The magnitude of the fluctuations at a fixed intensity scale linearly with
      the magnitude of the global wind, except in the case that the global wind
      is zero. When the global wind is zero, the magnitude of the fluctuations
      scale exponentially with `AirTurbulenceIntensity`, allowing low and high
      intensity turbulence to exist with wind velocities that still average out
      to zero.

      #### How to use CurrentCamera

      When looking for a client's `Class.Camera` object, use this property
      rather than looking for a child of `Class.Workspace` named "Camera".

      When you set this property, all other `Camera` objects in the `Workspace`
      are destroyed, including the previous `CurrentCamera`. If you set this
      property to `nil` or to a camera that is not a descendant of the Workspace
      (or the `CurrentCamera` is otherwise destroyed), a new `Camera` will be
      created and assigned. Avoid these scenarios, as destroying the camera can
      have unintended consequences.

      For more information, see
      [Scripting the Camera](../../../workspace/camera.md#scripting-the-camera).

    description: |
      The amount of time, in seconds, that the game has been running.

      Despite the title, this value is currently not 'Distributed' across the
      client and the server. Instead, on the server it represents how long the
      server has been running. On the client, it represents how long the client
      has been connected to the server.

      Developers should not rely on the above behavior, and it is possible this
      property will be synchronized across clients and the server in the future.

      Those looking for the time since the program started running should use
      the 'time' function instead. See below for a comparison between
      DistributedGameTime and its alternatives.

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      print(Workspace.DistributedGameTime) -- Time the game started running
      print(os.time()) -- Time since epoch (1 January 1970, 00:00:00) UTC
      print(tick()) -- Time since epoch (1 January 1970, 00:00:00) system time
      print(time()) -- Time the game started running
      print(elapsedTime()) -- Time since Roblox started running

      This property determines the height at which the engine automatically
      removes falling `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and their ancestor
      `Class.Model|Models` from `Class.Workspace` by parenting them to `nil`.
      This is to prevent parts that have fallen off the map from continuing to
      fall forever.

      If a part removed due to this behavior is the last part in a
      `Class.Model`, that model will also be removed. This applies to all model
      ancestors of the part.

      This property is clamped between -50,000 and 50,000 because
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` do not simulate or render properly at a great
      distance from the origin due to floating point inaccuracies.

      This property can be read by scripts, but can only be set by plugins, the
      command bar, or the properties window in Studio.

      Returns the number of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are deemed

      This function provides a measure of how many `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`

      forces.

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      ```

      In order to ensure good performance, the engine sets
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` in which physics are not being applied to a
      "sleeping" state. `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` with
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored` set to `true`, for example, will always be
      sleeping as physics doesn't apply to them. When a force is applied to a
      non‑anchored `Class.BasePart`, an "awake" state will be applied. Whilst a
      `Class.BasePart` is awake, the physics engine will perform continuous
      calculations to ensure physical forces interact correctly with the part.
      Once the `Class.BasePart` is no longer subject to physical forces, it will
      revert to a "sleeping" state.

    description: |
      Returns an integer, between 0 and 100, representing the percentage of real
      time that physics simulation is currently being throttled to.

      This function can be used to determine whether, and to what degree,
      physics throttling is occurring.

      #### What is physics throttling?

      Physics throttling occurs when the physics engine detects it cannot keep
      up with the game in real time. When physics is being throttled, it will
      update less frequently causing `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` to appear to
      move slower.

      Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out
      of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other
      undesirable behavior.

      Objects associated with `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` are exempt from physics
      throttling.

      See also `Class.Workspace:SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled()`.

      #### Demonstrating physics throttling

      Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics
      engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to
      simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only
      create a lot of `Class.Part|Parts` very quickly.

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local i = 0
      while true do
      	i += 1
      	if i % 5 == 0 then
      		task.wait()
      	end
      	local part = Instance.new("Part", Workspace)

      #### Using GetRealPhysicsFPS to combat exploiters

      A common use of this function is to detect if exploiters are increasing
      their local physics frame rate to move faster. This is generally done by
      comparing the result returned by a client's GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum
      that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If
      this limit is breached, developers can use the `Class.Player:Kick()`
      function to remove that `Class.Player` from the game. It is important to
      remember that, although this practice may be effective sometimes,
      client-side anti-exploiter measures are never 100% reliable.

    description: |
      This method returns the client's best approximation of the current time on
      the server. It is useful for creating synchronized experiences, as every
      client will get roughly the same results regardless of their timezone or
      local clock.

      This method returns a Unix timestamp, similar to `Library.os|os.time()`,
      that you can use with `Library.os|os.date()` or
      `Datatype.DateTime.fromUnixTimestamp()`. The timestamp is smoothed so
      that:

      - It is monotonic; its value will never decrease.
      - It moves at the same rate as the local clock to within 0.6%.

      This method is useful for making sure an event starts at the right
      real-world time and for periodic adjustments to keep a series of events in
      sync. For benchmarking or other use cases that require higher precision,
      consider `Library.os|os.clock()`.

      This method relies on the server, so calling it from a client that isn't
      connected will throw an error. Also note that this method is not suitable
      for things like timed rewards, as it is not secure compared to tracking
      such timers on the server.

      This function creates joints between the specified `Class.BasePart|Parts`

      joint creation mode.

      This function creates joints between the specified Parts and any planar
      touching surfaces, depending on the parts' surfaces and the specified
      joint creation mode.

      - Glue, Studs, Inlets, Universal, Weld, and Smooth surfaces will all
        create Weld instances.
      - Spheres will not surface-weld to anything. The rounded sides of
        cylinders will not surface-weld, but the flat end sides will.
      - Hinge and Motor surfaces will still create `Class.Rotate` and
        `Class.RotateP` joint instances, regardless of part shape.

      The first parameter is an array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`. Joints will
      only be created between the parts in the array and not in the array.
      Joints will not be created between the parts in the array.

      The second parameter is a `Enum.JointCreationMode` that determines how
      joints will be created. Passing in either enum value,
      `Enum.JointCreationMode|Enum.JointCreationMode.All` or
      `Enum.JointCreationMode|Enum.JointCreationMode.Surface`, has the same
      behavior which equates to Join Always

      **Deprecated**

      SurfaceType based joining is deprecated, do not use MakeJoints for new
      projects. `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints` and
      `Class.HingeConstraint|HingeConstraints` should be used instead.

      Goes through all `Class.BasePart|Parts` given. If any part's side has a
      `Enum.SurfaceType` that can make a joint it will create a joint with any
      adjacent parts.

      Joints will be created between the specified Parts and any planar touching
      surfaces, depending on the parts' surfaces.

      - Smooth surfaces will not create joints
      - Glue surfaces will create a `Class.Glue` joint
      - Weld will create a `Class.Weld` joint with any surface except for
        Unjoinable
      - Studs, Inlet, or Universal will each create a `Class.Snap` joint with
        either of other the other two surfaces (e.g. Studs with Inlet and
        Universal)
      - Hinge and Motor surfaces create `Class.Rotate` and `Class.RotateV` joint
        instances

      Unlike `Class.Model:MakeJoints()`, this function requires an array of
      parts as a parameter. This array is given as follows:

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      Workspace:MakeJoints({part1, part2, part3})
      ```

      Joints are broken if enough force is applied to them due to an
      `Class.Explosion`, unless a `Class.ForceField` object is parented to the
      `Class.BasePart` or ancestor `Class.Model`. For this reason, they are
      often used to make simple destructible buildings and other models.

      Breaks all joints between the specified `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and
      other `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`.

      This function requires an array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`. Note,
      joints will not be broken between these `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` (each
      other), only between these `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and other
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` not in the array.

      This function is used by the Roblox Studio **Move** tool when the user
      starts moving a selection. In conjunction with
      `Class.Plugin:GetJoinMode()` and `Class.Workspace:JoinToOutsiders()` it
      can be used to retain join functionality when developing custom Studio
      build tools. See the snippets below for an example.

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Finished moving a selection; make joints
      local function finishedMovingParts(parts)
      	local joinMode = Plugin:GetJoinMode()
      	Workspace:JoinToOutsiders(parts, joinMode)
      end
      ```

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Started moving a selection; break joints
      local function startMovingParts(parts)
      	Workspace:UnjoinFromOutsiders(parts)
