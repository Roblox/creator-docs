  Positions sibling UI elements in a single row.
description: |
  A UIListLayout lays out sibling UI elements in a single row within the parent
  UI element, either horizontally or vertically. Each sibling UI element retains
  its original `Class.GuiObject.Size`, but its `Class.GuiObject.Position` will
  be taken under control by the UIListLayout. While under control, the Position
  property of sibling UI elements will not be editable in the Properties window.

  You can use the elements' `Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder` by changing
  `Class.UIListLayout.SortOrder` to LayoutOrder. A UIListLayout will
  automatically re-layout elements when elements are added/removed, or if a
  relevant property changes: `Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder`,
  `Class.Instance.Name` or `Class.GuiObject.Size`. This can be triggered
  manually by calling `Class.UIGridStyleLayout:ApplyLayout()`, though this is
  typically not necessary.

  Since each property that changes how elements are laid out will re-apply the
  layout, it is recommended to set the `Class.Instance.Parent` property last so
  that the layout is only applied once. Similarly, since adding more UI elements
  will also re-apply the layout, add the UIListLayout last so it does not
  recalculate positions after each element.

      Determines the amount of free space between each element. Can be set
      either using scale (Percentage of parent's size in the current direction)
      or offset (a static spacing value, similar to pixel size).
