summary: |
  A container for `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` that renders in 3D space facing
  the camera.
description: |
  `Class.BillboardGui` is a container for UI objects to appear in the 3D space
  but always face the camera. The container's position is relative to the parent
  `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` (or the
  `Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee`). For `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, the
  `Class.BasePart.Position|Position` property is used, while for
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, the
  `Class.Attachment.WorldPosition|WorldPosition` property is used.

  <img src="/assets/ui/in-experience/BillboardGui-Diagram.jpg" width="800" alt="BillboardGui with a TextLabel describing the screen console it floats above." />

  A billboard's `Class.BillboardGui.Size|Size` property works slightly
  differently than `Class.GuiObject.Size`. While the **offset** components work
  the same, the **scale** components are used as stud sizes in 3D space.

  When creating a size-scaled `Class.BillboardGui` that contains a
  `Class.TextLabel`, it's useful to enable the label's
  `Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextScaled` property so that its text scales along
  with the billboard canvas as the camera distance changes.

  Note that interactive UI elements like `Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons` and
  `Class.TextButton|TextButtons` inside a `Class.BillboardGui` will only receive
  user input if they are parented to the `Class.PlayerGui`, typically via
  placing the `Class.BillboardGui` inside `Class.StarterGui`. The
  `Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee` property can be used to target a part or
  attachment in the 3D world while the `Class.BillboardGui` itself remains in
  the `Class.PlayerGui`.

  See [In-Experience UI](../../../ui/in-experience-containers.md#billboard-ui)
  for a guide on working with `Class.BillboardGui` containers.

  ##### Caching Behavior

  To help improve performance, the appearance of a `Class.BillboardGui` is
  cached until one of the following occurs, after which its appearance will be
  recomputed on the next rendering frame.

  - A descendant is added to or removed from the `Class.BillboardGui`.
  - A property of a descendant of the `Class.BillboardGui` changes.
  - A property of the `Class.BillboardGui` itself changes.

    description: |
      Controls whether the descendants will receive input events. If the
      `Class.BillboardGui` contains a `Class.GuiButton`, that button will become
      clickable only if `Class.BillboardGui.Active|Active` is set to `true` on
      both the `Class.BillboardGui` **and** the button.

      Note that interactive UI elements like `Class.ImageButton|ImageButtons`
      and `Class.TextButton|TextButtons` inside a `Class.BillboardGui` will only
      receive user input if they are parented to the `Class.PlayerGui`,
      typically via placing the `Class.BillboardGui` inside `Class.StarterGui`.
      The `Class.BillboardGui.Adornee|Adornee` property can be used to target a
      part or attachment in the 3D world while the `Class.BillboardGui` itself
      remains in the `Class.PlayerGui`.

      This property determines whether the `Class.BillboardGui` will always
      render on top of other 3D objects.

      When set to `false` (default), the `Class.BillboardGui` renders like other
      3D content and is occluded by other 3D objects. When set to `true`, the
      `Class.BillboardGui` always renders on top of 3D content and the
      appearance changes significantly:

      - Colors match how they appear inside a `Class.ScreenGui`.
      - Text may appear sharper on high DPI devices.
      - `Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence` is treated as though
        it's `0`.
      - `Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness` has no effect.

      This property determines the factor by which the `Class.BillboardGui`
      container's light is scaled when
      `Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence` is `0`. By default,
      this property is `1` and can be set to any number between `0` and `1000`.
      By modifying this property, the apparent brightness of a
      `Class.BillboardGui` can be better matched to its environment. For
      instance, a video billboard can be brightened inside a dark room by
      increasing `Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness` to `10`.

      Note that `Class.BillboardGui.Brightness|Brightness` is inaccessible in
      Studio and has no effect when either
      `Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence` is `1` or
      `Class.BillboardGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` is `true`.
