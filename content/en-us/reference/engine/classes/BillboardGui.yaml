  A container for `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` that renders in 3D space facing
  the camera.
description: |
  BillboardGuis are containers for `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` that appear in
  the 3D space. BillboardGuis always face the camera, and can either change size
  with distance or remain the same size on the screen based on the
  `Class.BillboardGui.Size` property.

  Their position is relative to the `Class.BillboardGui.Adornee`. If no Adornee
  is set, then the parent of the BillboardGui will be used as the adornee. For
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, the `Class.BasePart.Position|Position` property
  will be used. For `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, the
  `Class.Attachment.WorldPosition|WorldPosition` property will be used.

  The `Class.BillboardGui.Size|Size` property of a BillboardGui works slightly
  differently than `Class.GuiObject.Size`. The Offset portion works the same,
  but the Scale portion is used as a size in studs in 3D space.

  A size of `UDim2.fromScale(4, 5)` is 4x5 studs, and scales the UI larger and
  smaller depending on distance from the camera. A size of
  `UDim2.fromOffset(200, 100)` is always 200x100 on the screen, and does not
  change size with distance. Scale and Offset values can also be combined
  together, like with `Class.GuiObject.Size`.

  When creating size-scaled BillboardGuis, it's important to make sure all the
  UI objects within are using Scale sizing and all text has
  `Class.TextLabel.TextScaled` enabled, to ensure correct scaling.

  The AbsolutePosition property of a BillboardGui and all of its descendants is
  relative to the top left corner of its canvas, and so is always `0, 0` for the
  BillboardGui instance.

  ## Caching Static UI for Performance

  A Gui's appearance is cached until one of the following events occurs:

  - A descendant is added to the Gui.
  - A descendant is removed from the Gui.
  - A property of a descendant of the Gui changes.
  - A property of the Gui changes.

  If any of these events occur, the Gui's appearance will be recomputed the next
  frame it gets rendered.

      Controls whether the descendants will receive input events. If the UI
      contains a `Class.GuiButton` then that button will become clickable only
      if Active is set to true on both the BillboardGui and the button.

      BillboardGuis will only receive user input if they are parented to the
      PlayerGui. The `Class.BillboardGui.Adornee` property can be used to target
      a Part in the workspace while the UI itself is in the `Class.PlayerGui`.

      When set to false, the BillboardGui will render like other 3D content, and
      will be occluded by other 3D objects.

      When set to true, it always renders on top of 3D content, and the
      appearance changes significantly:

      - Colors match how they appear inside a `Class.ScreenGui`.
      - Text may appear sharper on high DPI devices.
      - `Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence` is treated as though it was 0.
      - `Class.BillboardGui.Brightness` has no effect.

      **Brightness** determines the factor by which the GUI's emitted light is
      scaled. By default, this property is 1 and can be set to any number on the
      range [0, 1000].

      By modifying this property, the apparent brightness of a GUI can be better
      matched to its environment. For instance, a video billboard like those
      found in Times Square can be made brighter to be clearly visible on a
      bright day.

      This property won't produce any effect in the following scenarios wherein
      the GUI does not emit light.:

      - When `Class.BillboardGui.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` is true, the color of
        each pixel is the color shown on-screen.
      - When `Class.BillboardGui.LightInfluence|LightInfluence` is 1, all light
        from the GUI is reflected from the environment instead of being emit.

      Sets the maximum distance a billboard can be from the camera and still be

    description: |
      The MaxDistance property of a `Class.BillboardGui` sets how far away in
      studs that billboard can be from the camera and still be drawn. If the
      camera and billboard are moved further apart than the maximum distance,
      then the billboard will not be visible regardless of any other properties
      of the billboard or any GUI objects it contains. The default value of this
      property is infinity

      If this value is set to less than or equal to 0 then the maximum distance
      will be treated as infinite and the billboard will always be drawable.

      task.wait(5)

      -- Set part's position and lock in place
      part.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 10, 0)
      part.Anchored = true

      -- Set up billboard
      billboard.MaxDistance = 10
      billboard.Adornee = part
      billboard.AlwaysOnTop = true
      billboard.Size = UDim2.fromOffset(50, 50)

      -- Set up label
      label.Size = UDim2.fromScale(1, 1)

      -- Set parents of objects
      label.Parent = billboard
      billboard.Parent = part
      part.Parent = workspace

      -- Move camera next to part. Wait a bit and then move camera
      local cameraPosition0 = part.Position + Vector3.new(0, 0, 10)
      local cameraPosition1 = part.Position + Vector3.new(0, 0, 20)
      camera.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(cameraPosition0, part.Position)

      -- Contents of billboard will be visible here
      task.wait(2)
      camera.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(cameraPosition1, part.Position)
      -- Contents of billboard will no longer be visible (outside MaxDistance)
