      Determines whether a `Class.BaseScript` will run or not.

      If a script is disabled by changing this property to true while the script
      is running, the current running thread of the script will be terminated.

      If this property is changed from true to false, the script will run again.
      This means that `Class.BaseScript.Disabled|Disabled` can be toggled to
      restart a script:

      ```lua
      scriptObject.Disabled = true
      scriptObject.Disabled = false
      ```

      Note that the above code snippet cannot be used within the script itself,
      since disabling the script from within itself will terminate the thread
      and the line to reenable it will never execute.

      used in favor of the similar but opposite
      `Class.BaseScript.Disabled|Disabled` property.

      script is running, the current running thread of the script will be

      The content ID of an uploaded script. When set binds the uploaded code to
      the script's `Class.Script.Source`.

      By default, this property is set to _'[Embedded]'_. This means the source
      of the script is not linked to an upload script and is instead written in
      the script.

      ```lua
      script.LinkedSource = "http://www.roblox.com/asset/?id=1014476" -- link source
      ```

      Developers should remove a linked source via the properties window, rather
      than setting the property to _'[Embedded]'_.

      For the LinkedSource property for `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts`,
      please see `Class.ModuleScript.LinkedSource`.

      Determines the context under which the script will run.

      When using the Legacy RunContext scripts will only run when parented to
      certain containers dependent on whether they are a `Class.Script` or
      `Class.LocalScript`.

      If RunContext is assigned while the script is running any threads created
      by the script will be terminated and the script will start running under
      the new context if possible.

      Note, RunContext cannot be used from a LocalScript.
