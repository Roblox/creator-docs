      The data sent for initial loading is compressed so the contributions are
      approximate.

    summary: |
      Whether debug messages will be printed to the output pertaining to physics
      replication errors.
    description: |
      When set to `true`, debug messages will be printed to the **Output**
      window pertaining to physics replication errors. The following are debug
      outputs that are made available:

      - `Physics-in old packet` prints for a part that has been updated ahead of
        the packet's submission time. This happens if the packet is received
        late, and a newer packet has already been processed.

      - `Physics-in of unidentified {GUID}` prints for an unfound part that is
        trying to be updated because the provided `Class.Instance` identifier
        was invalid, where `{GUID}` is the unknown `Class.Instance:GetDebugId()`
        identifier that is supposed to be targeting the part. This typically
        happens if a part is removed before the physics update packet is
        received.

      - `Physics-in of part not in workspace {GUID}` prints for a request to
        update the physics of a part that is not a descendant of the
        `Class.Workspace`, where `{GUID}` is the `Class.Instance:GetDebugId()`
        identifier of the target part. This happens if the part was just moved
        out of the `Class.Workspace`, and was previously being simulated.

    summary: |
      Whether debug information is printed to the output regarding the
      replication of instances when `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled` is set to
      `true`.
    description: |
      When set to `true`, debug information is printed to the **Output** window
      regarding the replication of instances when
      `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled` is set to `true`. Note that this
      documentation may become outdated in the future, as Roblox's network code
      is always changing behind the scenes.

      #### Streaming Capacity Update

      When the client's streaming capacity is updated, the following debug
      message will be printed:

      `clientInstanceQuota {1}, packet in queue {2}, predictedTotalInstanceProcessTime {3}, avgStreamDataReadTime {4}, avgInstancesPerStreamData {5}`

      - `{1}` — The ID of the client instance quota.
      - `{2}` — The current number of incoming packets that have been queued.
      - `{3}` — A prediction for how long it will take to update the quota.
      - `{4}` — The current average time it takes to read the stream data.
      - `{5}` — The average number of instances in the stream data.

      #### Instance Quota Update

      When the client receives an instance quota update, the following debug
      message will be printed:

      `Received new client instance quota: {1}, max region radius: {2}`

      - `{1}` — The ID of the client instance quota.
      - `{2}` — The maximum radius of space around the client's
        `Class.Player.ReplicationFocus` that can have physical instances
        streamed in.

      randomizing the order that instances initially arrive on clients. It is
      recommended to keep this setting enabled to help discover potential bugs
      while testing in Studio.
