name: AudioAnalyzer
type: class
memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  Takes measurements from audio streams that are connected to it via one or more
  `Class.Wire|Wires`.
description: |
  `Class.AudioAnalyzer` takes measurements from audio streams that are wired to
  it through `Class.Wire`. It provides a single **Input** pin but does not
  produce any output streams. Note that all audio processing is disabled on the
  server in order to conserve resources; Properties and methods of
  `Class.AudioAnalyzer` return empty or zero results when used from server
  scripts.

      The root-mean-square average volume observed during the last audio buffer.
      This property is generally more stable than
      `Class.AudioAnalyzer.PeakLevel|PeakLevel` but it may not capture momentary
      volume spikes. This property changes more often than the framerate and
      does not fire changed events. On the server, this property is always `0`.

    description: |
      Enables usage of `Class.AudioAnalyzer:GetSpectrum|GetSpectrum()`. If
      `false`, `Class.AudioAnalyzer:GetSpectrum|GetSpectrum()` returns an empty
      array, but the CPU overhead of the `Class.AudioAnalyzer` is dramatically
      reduced. This means that if you are only analyzing the **volume** of an
      audio stream, you can disable this property to improve performance.

      Returns the frequency spectrum of the last audio buffer, as an array of
      numbers. The elements of the array are root-mean-square volume levels,
      evenly spaced from 0 hertz to 24,000 hertz. If any of the analyzer's
      inputs come from an `Class.AudioDeviceInput`, or this method is used from
      a server script, it returns an empty array.
