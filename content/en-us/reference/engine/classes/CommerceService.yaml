    summary: |
      Fires when commerce purchase webview has closed - not an indicator that a
      purchase was successful.
    description: |
      Use this signal to detect when a user has completed the purchasing flow
      and the webview has closed to resume gameplay within the experience.
      **This signal does not indicate a successful purchase**, so do not grant
      virtual items solely from this signal.

      While optional, it is recommended to use this signal to reorient your
      users on Android, as the commerce purchasing flow will have forced them
      into portrait mode.
