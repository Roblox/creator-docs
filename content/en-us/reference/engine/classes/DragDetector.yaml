  `Class.DragDetector` instances encourage physical interaction with objects in
  an experience.
description: |
  `Class.DragDetector` instances encourage physical interaction with objects in
  an experience, such as opening doors and drawers, sliding a part around, and
  much more. Key features include:

  - Place a `Class.DragDetector` under any part or model to make it draggable
    via all inputs (mouse, touch, gamepad, and VR), all without a single line of
    code.
  - Choose from many `Class.DragDetector.DragStyle|DragStyle` options, define
    how the object responds to motion via
    `Class.DragDetector.ResponseStyle|ResponseStyle`, and optionally apply axis
    or movement limits.
  - Scripts can respond to manipulation of dragged objects to drive UI or make
    logical decisions, such as adjusting the light level in a room based on a
    sliding wall switch dimmer.
  - Players can manipulate anchored parts or models and they'll stay exactly
    where you put them upon release.
  - `Class.DragDetector|DragDetectors` work in Studio as long as you're **not**
    using the **Select**, **Move**, **Scale**, or **Rotate** tools, making it
    easier to test and adjust draggable objects while editing.

  See the [Drag Detectors](../../../ui/drag-detectors.md) article for details
  and usage examples.

      Passes a function to be used if and only if
      `Class.DragDetector.DragStyle|DragStyle` is set to
      `Enum.DragDetectorDragStyle|Scriptable`. The given function is called when
      responding to a `Class.DragDetector.DragContinue|DragContinue` signal, it
      receives the signal's world space cursor ray with type `Datatype.Ray`, and
      it returns a `Datatype.CFrame` containing the desired location and
      orientation of the pivot in world space.

      If the function returns `nil`, the object will not be moved. This is
      useful if the script has not yet collected all the information it needs to
      give the correct answer, or in temporary cases where you want the object
      to stay where it is.
