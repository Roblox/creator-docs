  LayerCollector is the base class of 2D UI containers which render
  `Class.GuiObject` descendants, such as `Class.ScreenGui`.

  ## Caching static UI for performance improvements

  A Gui's appearance is cached until one of the following events occurs:

  - A descendant is added to the Gui.
  - A descendant is removed from the Gui.
  - A property of a descendant of the Gui changes.
  - A property of the Gui changes.

  If any of these events occur, the Gui's appearance will be recomputed the next
  frame it gets rendered.

      When set to false, this `Class.LayerCollector` will only be cloned into
      each player's `Class.PlayerGui` once, and the `Class.LayerCollector` will
      not be deleted when the player respawns.

      When set to true, this `Class.LayerCollector` will be cloned into each
      player's `Class.PlayerGui` when they respawn, and it will
      delete itself when the player respawns again.

      Controls how `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` behaves on all descendants of the
      LayerCollector.

      `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Global` sorts all descendants according to the
      ZIndex, then breaks ties using the hierarchy order. As a result,
      descendants of a `Class.GuiObject` need to have a ZIndex value that's at
      least as high as the parent, or they will render underneath their parent.

      With `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Sibling`, children always render above their
      parents, and the ZIndex is used to decide the order in which children of a
      single UI object will render over each other.
