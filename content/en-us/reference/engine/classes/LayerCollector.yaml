  The base class of 2D UI containers which render `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`
  in layers.
description: |
  **LayerCollector** is the base class of 2D UI containers which render
  `Class.GuiObject` descendants, such as `Class.ScreenGui`.

  For performance improvements, the appearance of a `Class.LayerCollector` is
  cached until one of the following events occurs:

  - A descendant is added to or removed from it.
  - A property of a descendant changes.
  - A property of the `Class.LayerCollector` itself changes.

    summary: |
      Determines if the `Class.LayerCollector` resets (deletes itself and
      re-clones into the player's `Class.PlayerGui`) every time the player's
      character respawns.
    description: |
      When set to `false` and this `Class.LayerCollector` is a direct child of
      `Class.StarterGui`, it will only be cloned into each player's
      `Class.PlayerGui` once and it will not be deleted when the player's
      character respawns.

      When set to `true` (default), or if this `Class.LayerCollector` is an
      **indirect** descendant of `Class.StarterGui`, it will be cloned into each
      player's `Class.PlayerGui` when their character respawns, and it will
      delete itself when the player's character respawns again.

      Controls how `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` behaves on all descendants of this
      `Class.LayerCollector`.

      With `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Sibling` (default), children always render above
      their parents, and the `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex` is used to decide
      the order in which children of a single UI object will render over each
      other.

      `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Global` sorts all descendants according to the
      `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex`, then breaks ties using the hierarchy
      order. As a result, descendants of a `Class.GuiObject` need to have a
      `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex` value that's at least as high as the
      parent, or they will render underneath their parent.
