  LayerCollector is the base class of 2D UI containers which render
  `Class.GuiObject` descendants, such as `Class.ScreenGui`.

  ## Caching static UI for performance improvements

  A Gui's appearance is cached until one of the following events occurs:

  - A descendant is added to the Gui.
  - A descendant is removed from the Gui.
  - A property of a descendant of the Gui changes.
  - A property of the Gui changes.

  If any of these events occur, the Gui's appearance will be recomputed the next
  frame it gets rendered.

      When set to false, this LayerCollector will only be cloned into each
      `Class.Player|player's` `Class.PlayerGui` once, and the LayerCollector
      will not be deleted when the player respawns.

      When set to true, the LayerCollector will be cloned into each
      `Class.Player|player's` `Class.PlayerGui` when they respawn, and it will
      delete itself when the player respawns again.

      Controls how `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` behaves on all descendants of the
      LayerCollector.

      `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Global` sorts all descendants according to the
      ZIndex, then breaks ties using the hierarchy order. As a result,
      descendants of a `Class.GuiObject` need to have a ZIndex value that's at
      least as high as the parent, or they will render underneath their parent.

      With `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Sibling`, children always render above their
      parents, and the ZIndex is used to decide the order in which children of a
      single UI object will render over each other.
