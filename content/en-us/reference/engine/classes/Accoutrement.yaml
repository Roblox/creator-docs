  An object that can attach to a player's character.
description: |
  An Accoutrement welds its child `Class.Part|part` called "Handle" to the
  player's character. You can change the position and rotation of the Handle
  part using the `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentPos|AttachmentPos`,
  `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentRight|Right`,
  `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentForward|Forward`, and
  `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentUp|Up` properties.

  Parts descending from an accoutrement are massless when attach to other parts
  (e.g. with a Weld) as long as they are not the root part of the assembly that
  `Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()|GetRootPart()` returns.
  `Class.BasePart:GetMass()|GetMass()` returns 0 for parts in this case, and it
  doesn't add to the total mass or rotational inertia of the Assembly.

  This doesn't apply to a part descending from an accoutrement when an
  accoutrement welds to another part that is massless or one if its parts
  otherwise becomes root. This also doesn't apply for the root part, and it has
  mass like a normal part.
