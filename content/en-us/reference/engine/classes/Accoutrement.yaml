  An object that can attach to a player's character.
description: |
  An Accoutrement welds its child `Class.BasePart|part` called "Handle" to the
  player's character. You can change the position and rotation of the Handle
  part using either the `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentPoint` property or
  an `Class.Attachment` within the Handle.

  When an accoutrement is attached to a character it will attach to the Head by default.
  A `Class.Weld` named "HeadWeld" will be created in the head with its `Class.Weld.Part0|Part0`
  set to the Head and its `Class.Weld.Part1|Part1` set to the Handle. Its `Class.Weld.C0|C0`
  will be set to `0, 0.5, 0` and its `Class.Weld.C1|C1` will be set to the Accoutrement's.
  `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentPoint`. The `Class.Weld.C1` will update automatically when the
  `Class.Accoutrement.AttachmentPoint` changes. The HeadWeld will automatically
  be destroyed if the Accoutrement is removed from the character.

  The default attachment ("HeadWeld" behavior) can be overridden using a child
  `Class.Attachment|attachment` within the Handle. If the Handle contains an
  `Class.Attachment|attachment` wth a name matching the name of an `Class.Attachment|attachment`
  somewhere in the character, it will be attached there instead of
  being attached to the Head. When this happens, a `Class.Weld` named "AccessoryWeld"
  will be automatically created within the Handle. It's `Class.Weld.Part0|Part0` will
  be set to the Handle and its `Class.Weld.Part1|Part1` will be set to the
  attached `Class.BasePart|part`. The AccessoryWeld's `Class.Weld.C0|C0` will be
  set to the `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` of the Handle's `Class.Attachment`
  and the `Class.Weld.C1|C1` will be set to the `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` of
  the character `Class.Attachment|attachment`. These `Class.Weld.C0|C0` and `Class.Weld.C1|C1`
  values will automatically update when either `Class.Attachment|attachment` is updated.
  Like the Headweld, the AccessoryWeld will be destroyed automatically when
  the Accoutrement is removed from the character.

  Parts descending from an accoutrement are massless when attach to other parts
  (e.g. with a `Class.Weld`) as long as they are not the root part of the assembly that
  `Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()|GetRootPart()` returns.
  `Class.BasePart:GetMass()|GetMass()` returns 0 for parts in this case, and it
  doesn't add to the total mass or rotational inertia of the Assembly.

  The size of the Handle `Class.BasePart|part` will update automatically when the
  scale of its attached `Class.BasePart|part` is changed using `Class.Humanoid|humanoid`
  scaling features. The size will **not** change when the accoutrement is equipped,
  only when the scale changes. When this happens, a `Class.Vector3Value` named
  "OriginalSize" will be created in the Handle with its value set to the Handle's
  original size, if there isn't one already.

  A `Class.TouchTransmitter` named "TouchInterest" will automatically be created
  in the Handle if the Accoutrement isn't equipped. It will be destroyed automatically
  whenever the Accoutrement becomes equipped. This is an artifact from a removed feature
  allowing players to drop and equip hats. It has no effect on the Accoutrement's behavior
  today.
