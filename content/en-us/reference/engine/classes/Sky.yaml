  Changes the default appearance of the experience's sky.
description: |
  The `Sky` object, when placed inside `Class.Lighting`, changes the default
  appearance of the experience's sky. This object's
  [skybox](../../../environment/skybox.md) is composed of six sides, like a
  cube. Rotation of the skybox can be changed through
  `Class.Sky.SkyboxOrientation|SkyboxOrientation`.

  The skybox sun, moon, and other celestial objects remain visible unless you
  turn off the `Class.Sky.CelestialBodiesShown|CelestialBodiesShown` property.
  By adjusting the `Class.Sky.StarCount|StarCount` property, you can change how
  many stars appear in the sky at night.

  This object can also be used as a cubemap for reflections in
  `Class.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames`, in which case only the `Class.Sky`
  object's six‑side `Skybox[…]` properties are used. For details, see
  [viewport frames](../../../ui/viewport-frames.md).

    summary: |
      Angle of the skybox, in degrees, with rotation order of **Y**, **X**,
      **Z**.
    description: |
      Changes the orientation of the skybox surfaces. This property takes a
      `Datatype.Vector3` of degree values in the typical **XYZ** order, but
      rotation is **applied** first around the **Y** axis, then **X**, and then
      **Z** to allow for predictable control over complex movements.

      An easy way to script an orientation animation is to spin around the **Y**
      axis (keeping the horizon level), then tilt this axis by setting **X** and
      **Z** to a fixed value:

      ```lua
      local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local sky = Lighting:FindFirstChild("Sky")

      local ROTATION_SPEED = 5  -- In degrees per second

      RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(deltaTime)
      	sky.SkyboxOrientation = Vector3.new(
      		30,
      		(sky.SkyboxOrientation.Y + ROTATION_SPEED * deltaTime) % 360,
      		0
      	)
      end)
      ```

      See [here](../../../environment/skybox.md#orientation) for further info
      and limitations.
