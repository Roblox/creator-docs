summary: |
  Changes the default appearance of the experience's sky.
description: |
  The `Sky` object, when placed inside `Class.Lighting`, changes the default
  appearance of the experience's sky. This object's
  [skybox](../../../environment/skybox.md) is composed of six sides, like a
  cube. Rotation of the skybox can be changed through
  `Class.Sky.SkyboxOrientation|SkyboxOrientation`.

  The skybox sun, moon, and other celestial objects remain visible unless you
  turn off the `Class.Sky.CelestialBodiesShown|CelestialBodiesShown` property.
  By adjusting the `Class.Sky.StarCount|StarCount` property, you can change how
  many stars appear in the sky at night.

  This object can also be used as a cubemap for reflections in
  `Class.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames`, in which case only the `Class.Sky`
  object's six‑side `Skybox[…]` properties are used. For details, see
  [viewport frames](../../../ui/viewport-frames.md).

    summary: |
      Angle of the skybox, in degrees, with rotation order of **Y**, **X**,
      **Z**.
    description: |
      Changes the orientation of the skybox surfaces. This property takes a
      `Datatype.Vector3` of degree values in the typical **XYZ** order, but
      applies rotation **first** around the **Y** axis. After applying the Y
      axis rotation, the orientation is applied to the **X** and **Z** axes to
      allow for predictable control over complex movements. Your camera and
      object orientation can affect how this rotation appears to be applied.

      An easy way to script an orientation animation is to spin around the **Y**
      axis (keeping the horizon level), then tilt this axis by setting **X** and
      **Z** to a fixed value:

      ```lua
      local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local sky = Lighting:FindFirstChild("Sky")

      local ROTATION_SPEED = 5  -- In degrees per second

      RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(deltaTime)
      	sky.SkyboxOrientation = Vector3.new(
      		30,
      		(sky.SkyboxOrientation.Y + ROTATION_SPEED * deltaTime) % 360,
      		0
      	)
      end)
      ```

      See [here](../../../environment/skybox.md#orientation) for further info
      and limitations.
