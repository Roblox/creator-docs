  The Sky object is an object that, when placed inside `Class.Lighting`, will
  change the appearance of the game's sky. This allows for a custom sky to be
  used as opposed to the Roblox default sky. The Skybox is composed of six
  sides, much like that of a cube. If the skybox is changed/customized, the Sun
  and other objects in the sky will remain visible, unless you turn off the Sky
  object's `Class.Sky.CelestialBodiesShown` property, which will remove the Sun,
  Moon, and stars from the sky. The recommended picture dimensions for a Skybox
  side are 256x256 pixels. By adjusting the `Class.Sky.StarCount` property of
  the Sky object, you can change how many stars will appear in the sky at night.
