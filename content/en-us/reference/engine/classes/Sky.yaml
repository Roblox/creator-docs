  Changes the default appearance of the experience's sky.
description: |
  The **Sky** object, when placed inside `Class.Lighting`, changes the default
  appearance of the experience's sky. This object's
  [skybox](../../../environment/skybox.md) is composed of six sides, like a
  cube. If you customize the skybox, the sun, moon, and other celestial objects
  remain visible unless you turn off the
  `Class.Sky.CelestialBodiesShown|CelestialBodiesShown` property. By adjusting
  the `Class.Sky.StarCount|StarCount` property, you can change how many stars
  appear in the sky at night.

  This object can also be used as a cubemap for reflections in
  `Class.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames`, in which case only the `Class.Sky`
  object's six **Skybox[…]** properties are used. For details, see
  [viewport frames](../../../ui/viewport-frames.md).
