description: |
  A PointLight is a light source that emits illumination from a single point.
  Light is emitted spherically based on the `Class.PointLight.Range` of the
  PointLight.

  In order for a PointLight to provide illumination, it must be the direct child
  of a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` (the part or attachment itself
  must be a descendant of the `Class.Workspace`).

  If a PointLight is parented to a part, then the light will emanate from the
  part's `Class.BasePart.Position`. If a PointLight is parented to an
  attachment, then the light will emanate from the attachment's
  `Class.Attachment.WorldPosition`.

  For more light types, see the **see also** section.
