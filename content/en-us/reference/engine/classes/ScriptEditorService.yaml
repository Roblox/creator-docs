    summary: |
      Registers an autocomplete callback `callbackFunction` named `name` with
      priority `priority`.
    description: |
      Registers an autocomplete callback `callbackFunction` named `name` with
      priority `priority`.

      When the Script Editor invokes autocomplete, all registered autocomplete
      callbacks call in order of ascending priority with the autocomplete
      request and response. Multiple callbacks may share a priority, but then
      their calling order is unpredictable. Each callback is intended to return
      a response table with the same format as the response input table.
      Callbacks shouldn't yield. The first callback invoked receives the
      internal autocomplete's response as its response table, and subsequent
      callbacks receive the previous callback's output as their response table.
      Callbacks may either modify the passed table or return a new table of the
      same format.

      The `callbackFunction` must have the following type:
      `(Request: table, Response: table) -> table`

      The Request table has the following format:

      ```lua
      type Request = {
        position: {
          line: number,
          character: number
        },
        textDocument: {
          document: ScriptDocument?,
          script: LuaSourceContainer?
        }
      }
      ```

      - `position` is the one-indexed cursor position where you are
        autocompleting.
      - `textDocument.document` is the open `Class.ScriptDocument` you are
        completing in, if it exists.
      - `textDocument.script` is the `Class.LuaSourceContainer` you are
        completing in, if it exists.

      If both `textDocument.document` and `textDocument.script` are present,
      then they correspond to each other:
      `req.textDocument.document:GetScript() == req.textDocument.script`

      The Response table has the following format:

      ```
      type Response = {
        items: {
          {
            label: string, -- The label
            kind: Enum.CompletionItemKind?,
            tags: {Enum.CompletionItemTag}?,
            detail: string?,
            documentation: {
              value: string,
            }?,
            overloads: number?,
            learnMoreLink: string?,
            codeSample: string?,
            preselect: boolean?,
            textEdit: {
              newText: string,
              insert: { start: { line: number, character: number }, ["end"]: { line: number, character: number } },
              replace: { start: { line: number, character: number }, ["end"]: { line: number, character: number } },
            }?
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      - `Response.items` is an array of the completion items. The order of this
        array is insignificant, and it resorts in the editor as the user types.
      - `Response.items[n].label` is the label of the item which display in the
        autocomplete menu.
      - `Response.items[n].kind` specifies what type of autocomplete item this
        is. Primarily this controls the icon given to the item in the editor.
        Not all kinds have a unique icon. If not specified, the editor uses the
        "Text" icon. Unsupported kinds default to displaying the "Property"
        icon.
      - `Response.items[n].tags` specifies an array of tags describing this
        completion item. See the `Enum.CompletionItemTag` for details on their
        function.
      - `Response.items[n].details` specifies a string describing details about
        the completion item. For default items, this is a string representation
        of their type. Note that, in order for the documentation widget to
        display, `documentation` must be present, but `documentation.value` may
        be empty.
      - `Response.items[n].documentation` specifies the main body of the
        documentation in its `value` field. `documentation` is present, even if
        value is empty, so the documentation window displays if either details
        or overloads are specified.
      - `Response.items[n].overloads` specifies the number of overloads of a
        function autocompletion.
      - `Response.items[n].learnMoreLink` links to a relevant page on the
        creator docs. This URL must be a `https` request to create.roblox.com;
        no other URLs display in the editor.
      - `Response.items[n].codeSample` specifies a sample use of the completion
        item. `documentation` must be non-empty to display this field.
      - `Response.items[n].preselect` If true, the editor sorts this completion
        item ahead of all others and selects it for the user by default. No
        effect if false or missing.
      - `Response.items[n].textEdit` If present, accepting the completion
        applies this text edit - inserting or replacing the span between the
        positions start and end with newText.

      If a callback returns a malformed result or encounters an error, the
      editor discards the modified Response table and uses the built-in
      autocomplete result list.

    description: |
      Registers a Script Analysis callback `callbackFunction` named `name` with
      `priority`. When Script Analysis in Studio runs, all registered callbacks
      call in order of ascending priority. Each callback is intended to return a
      response table matching the format specified below. Callbacks should not
      yield.

      The request table has the following format, where `script` is the
      `LuaSourceContainer` that is going to be analyzed.

      ```
      type Request = {
        script: LuaSourceContainer?
      }
      ```

      The response table has the following format, where `diagnostics` is an
      array of diagnostic tables. Each diagnostic table has the entries listed
      below.

      ```
      type Response = {
        diagnostics: {
          {
            range: {
              start: {
                line: number,
                character: number,
              },
              ["end"]: {
                line: number,
                character: number,
              }
            },

            codeDescription: { href: string }?
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      - `range` represents a text range that should be highlighted by the
        linter, providing what line/character to start highlighting and what
        line/character to stop highlighting.
      - `code` is a label for the message.
      - `message` is a warning message to be displayed for the line. This will
        also appear on a tooltip when the user hovers their cursor over the line
        in the Script Editor.
      - `severity` is a `Enum.Severity` value for the diagnostics. This
        determines how the diagnostic is categorized in the Script Analysis tool
        in Studio, as well as how text is highlighted in the Script Editor.
      - `codeDescription` links to a relevant page on the creator docs. This URL
        must be an `https` request to `create.roblox.com`; no other URLs display
        in the editor.

    description: |
      Returns the edit-time `Class.Script.Source` for the given script.

      This function calls the passed callback using the old contents of the
      script to calculate the new contents of the script.

      If the script is open in the
      [Script Editor](../../../studio/script-editor.md), then it issues a
      request to the editor to update its source. The editor may reject this
      update if the `Class.Script.Source` property was out of date with the
      user's version of the script when this function was called, in which case
      the callback will be re-invoked and the attempt will be repeated.

      The callback may not yield. If the callback returns `nil`, the operation
      is cancelled. This function yields until the operation is cancelled or
      succeeds.

      If the script is not open in the editor, the new content updates to the
      script source, which is the text the editor would display if it is opened.

      ```lua
      local ses = game:GetService('ScriptEditorService')
