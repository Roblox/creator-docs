name: RodConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Keeps two attachments separated by its defined
  `Class.RodConstraint.Length|Length`.
description: |
  A **RodConstraint** keeps two attachments separated by its defined
  `Class.RodConstraint.Length|Length`. By default, both attachments can rotate
  freely, although you can enable limits to restrict rotational tilt.

  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**)
  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not
  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.

  #### Limits

  You can limit rotation of the attachments within a cone, independently of each
  other, by enabling the `Class.RodConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled`
  property and setting `Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle0|LimitAngle0` and
  `Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle1|LimitAngle1` respectively.
