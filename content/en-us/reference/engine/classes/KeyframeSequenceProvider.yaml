  The KeyframeSequenceProvider service provides functions to load and preview
  `Class.KeyframeSequence`s. It includes a number of functions that are useful
  when working with `Class.Animation`s.

  ## What is a KeyframeSequence?

  A `Class.KeyframeSequence` stores a series of `Class.Pose|Poses` that encode
  the hierarchy and motion of an animation. The animation data Roblox uses in
  the playback of an animation, referenced by the `Class.Animation.AnimationId`
  property, can be constructed from a `Class.KeyframeSequence`.
  `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences` are usually created by the Roblox
  Animation Editor but can be created through other plugins or even manually.

  For more information, see the `Class.KeyframeSequence` page.

  ## What does the KeyframeSequenceProvider do?

  The KeyframeSequenceProvider has a number of uses.

  - Download the `Class.KeyframeSequence` associated with an animation content
    ID from the Roblox website
  - Generate a temporary id to locally preview an animation
  - Fetch the content IDs of animations owned by a particular user.

      Generates a temporary asset ID from a `Class.KeyframeSequence` that can be
      used for localized testing of an animation.

      This function performs the same function to
      `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterKeyframeSequence()` however this
      function generates an _active://_ URL instead of a hash.

      The ID generated can be used in an `Class.Animation.AnimationId` property
      for testing.

      The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
      outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
      used online should upload the `Class.KeyframeSequence` to Roblox.

      GetKeyframeSequenceAsync returns a `Class.KeyframeSequence` based on the

      function will yield until the `Class.KeyframeSequence` is loaded from the
      website. Because this is a webcall it should wrapped in a pcall.
