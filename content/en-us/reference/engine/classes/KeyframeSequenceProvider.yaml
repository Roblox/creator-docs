description: |
  The **KeyframeSequenceProvider** service provides functions to load and
  preview `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences`. It includes a number of
  functions that are useful when working with `Class.Animation|Animations`.

  A `Class.KeyframeSequence` stores a series of `Class.Pose|Poses` that encode
  the hierarchy and motion of an animation. The animation data Roblox uses in
  the playback of an animation, referenced by the `Class.Animation.AnimationId`
  property, can be constructed from a `Class.KeyframeSequence`.
  `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences` are usually created by the Roblox
  [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md) but can be created through
  other plugins or even manually.

      Generates a temporary asset ID from a `Class.KeyframeSequence` that can be
      used for localized testing of an animation.

      This function performs the same function to
      `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterKeyframeSequence()` however this
      function generates an _active://_ URL instead of a hash.

      The ID generated can be used in an `Class.Animation.AnimationId` property
      for testing.

      The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
      outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
      used online should upload the `Class.KeyframeSequence` to Roblox.
