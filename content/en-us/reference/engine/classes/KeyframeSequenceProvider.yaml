memory_category: Animation
summary: |
  Provides functions to load and preview `Class.KeyframeSequence`.
description: |
  The **KeyframeSequenceProvider** service provides functions to load and
  preview `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences`. It includes a number of
  functions that are useful when working with `Class.Animation|Animations`.

  A `Class.KeyframeSequence` stores a series of `Class.Pose|Poses` that encode
  the hierarchy and motion of an animation. The animation data Roblox uses in
  the playback of an animation, referenced by the `Class.Animation.AnimationId`
  property, can be constructed from a `Class.KeyframeSequence`.
  `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences` are usually created by the Roblox
  [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md) but can be created through
  other plugins or even manually.

      This function returns an `Class.InventoryPages` object which can be used
      to iterate over animations owned by a specific user.

      This function has a number of potential uses, such as allowing users to
      browse and import animations into a custom animation plugin.

    description: |
      GetKeyframeSequenceAsync returns a `Class.KeyframeSequence` based on the
      specified assetId. The assetId must correspond to an animation. The
      function will yield until the `Class.KeyframeSequence` is loaded from the
      website. Because this is a webcall it should wrapped in a pcall.

      Generates a temporary asset ID from a `Class.KeyframeSequence` that can be
      used for localized testing of an animation.

      This function performs the same function to
      `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterKeyframeSequence()` however this
      function generates an _active://_ URL instead of a hash.

      The ID generated can be used in an `Class.Animation.AnimationId` property
      for testing.

      The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
      outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
      used online should upload the `Class.KeyframeSequence` to Roblox.
