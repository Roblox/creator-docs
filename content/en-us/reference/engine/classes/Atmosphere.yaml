  Fog properties are hidden when Lighting contains an Atmosphere object.

  The **Atmosphere** object pushes Roblox closer toward realistic environments
  where sunlight scatters in different ways depending on density and other air
  particle properties. It simulates real-world "aerial perspective" and lets you
  control light transmission from the background sky through distant objects.
  Furthermore, it controls haze and glare conditions, letting you tune a perfect
  sunset, foggy afternoon, and more.

      more particles and the more in-game objects/terrain will be obscured by
      them. Note that density does not **directly** affect the skybox &mdash; it
      merely affects in-game objects/terrain and visibility of the skybox
      through them.

      Controls how light transmits between the camera and the sky background.
      Increase this value to create a horizon silhouette against the sky or
      reduce it to blend distant objects into the sky for an endless and
      seamless open world.

      Offset should be balanced against `Class.Atmosphere.Density` and carefully
      tested in your place. A low offset may cause "ghosting" where the skybox
      can be seen through objects/terrain. This can be corrected by increasing
      the offset, which more clearly silhouettes distant objects/terrain against
      the sky, but too much offset may reveal level-of-detail "popping" for far
      distant terrain and meshes.
