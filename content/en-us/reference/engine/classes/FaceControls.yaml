  The `Class.FaceControls` object defines a set of properties for controlling
  the facial expressions of a character head capable of animation.

  The FaceControls properties are based on the Facial Action Coding System
  (FACS), a comprehensive system for describing all visually discernible facial
  movement based on anatomy. `Class.FaceControls` properties can only be set
  between 0 and 1. Different combinations of the `Class.FaceControls` property
  values create different facial expressions. Recording multiple facial
  expressions over time creates facial animation.

  ## What is an Animatable Head?

  An animatable head is a `Class.MeshPart` that implements a facial rig and is
  capable of playing facial animations and triggering facial expressions. A
  `Class.FaceControls` object that is a child of a head `Class.MeshPart` can
  change the facial expressions of the head.

  A head consists of the following three components:

  - Skinned MeshPart instance for the head geometry with an internal rig that
    deforms this skinned MeshPart
  - FaceControls instance that drives the internal rig when properties such as
    FaceControls.JawDrop are changed.
  - Cage `Class.WrapTarget` instance for tight fitting facial accessories

  In a third-party modeling tool, such as Blender or Maya, an artist can create
  a joint-driven facial rig, pose the joints to match each of the individual
  FACS controls, and save as an FBX. When a head `.FBX` is imported in Studio, a
  facs-to-joint mapping is created. This mapping deforms the mesh geometry when
  FaceControls properties are changed. The mapping and the facial rig (including
  `Class.Bone` instances) are not exposed to developers and can only be accessed
  through the FaceControls instance. The `Class.MeshPart` for a Dynamic Head
  looks and behaves the same as a regular `Class.MeshPart` except when a
  FaceControls instance is a child of the MeshPart. Editing the properties of
  the FaceControls deforms the MeshPart's geometry. These properties are
  available to animate in the Animation Editor.

  See [Facial Animation](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/index.md) for
  more information on usage and creation of a animatable head.

  ## Animatable Heads in the Marketplace

  If you are publishing your head to the Marketplace, your head asset must
  include a minimum subset of face controls. Roblox's publishing validation
  rejects assets without the following required poses:

  - EyesLookDown
  - EyesLookLeft
  - EyesLookRight
  - EyesLookUp
  - JawDrop
  - LeftEyeClosed
  - LeftLipCornerPuller
  - LeftLipStretcher
  - LeftLowerLipDepressor
  - LeftUpperLipRaiser
  - LipsTogether
  - Pucker
  - RightEyeClosed
  - RightLipCornerPuller
  - RightLipStretcher
  - RightLowerLipDepressor
  - RightUpperLipRaiser

  See
  [FACS pose reference](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/facs-poses-reference.md)
  for more information on usage and creation of a animatable head.
