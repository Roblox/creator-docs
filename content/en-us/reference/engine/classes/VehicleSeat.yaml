name: VehicleSeat
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A seat object that can be used to control a vehicle.
description: |
  The VehicleSeat objects welds a player to the seat when the player touches the
  seat. It then forwards the movement keys to any connected motor joints,
  allowing control of a vehicle.

  While VehicleSeats are great for making simple vehicles they do have some
  limitations. Movement control will only detect motors connected directly to
  the vehicle seat, or through another rigid connection. This means that if you
  have a wheel connected to a beam which is then welded to the seat it will work
  fine, however if you have the wheel connected to a part, which is connected by
  a hinge to the rest of the car, it will not work.

      Toggles whether the `Class.VehicleSeat` is active or not. If the seat is
      disabled then it will not automatically weld a character to it on
      collision and will not allow a character to control the connected vehicle.
