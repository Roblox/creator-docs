name: WorldModel
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Extends limited physics for its children on to a parent `Class.ViewportFrame`.
description: |
  When parented to a `Class.ViewportFrame`, `WorldModel` extends limited physics
  for its children on to that `Class.ViewportFrame`. For example,
  `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are parented to the `WorldModel` can be
  animated and spatially queried (for example by raycasts) but those parts are
  **not** simulated. Furthermore, you can put `Class.Humanoid` characters in the
  `WorldModel` and their joints will be set up correctly for animation.

  To avoid possible performance issues, make sure to only create `WorldModels`
  when you want to show them and to delete `WorldModels` that are currently not
  in use.
