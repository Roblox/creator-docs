  The WorldModel provides some physics features to a `Class.ViewportFrame`.

  More specifically, you can make a WorldModel a child of a ViewportFrame, and
  then parent geometry to the WorldModel. This will then allow you to use
  raycasts in the ViewportFrame through the WorldModel. Furthermore you can put
  `Class.Humanoid` characters in the WorldModel and their joints will be set-up
  correctly, and you can animate them.
