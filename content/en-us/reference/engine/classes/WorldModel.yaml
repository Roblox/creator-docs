name: WorldModel
type: class
memory_category: PhysicsParts
summary: Extends limited physics for its children on to a parent `Class.ViewportFrame`.
description: |-
  When parented to a `Class.ViewportFrame`, `WorldModel` extends limited physics for its children on to that `Class.ViewportFrame`. For example, `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are parented to the `WorldModel` can be animated and spatially queried (for example by raycasts) but those parts are **not** simulated. Furthermore, you can put `Class.Humanoid` characters in the `WorldModel` and their joints will be set up correctly for animation.

  To avoid possible performance issues, make sure to only create `WorldModels` when you want to show them and to delete `WorldModels` that are currently not in use.
