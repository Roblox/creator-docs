summary: |
  Applies constant force to an assembly.
description: |
  The `VectorForce` constraint applies constant force to an assembly. The
  direction and strength of the force is determined by a `Datatype.Vector3` and
  can be relative to an attachment on the part, another attachment, or the world
  coordinate system. Alternatively:

  - Because the `VectorForce` constraint applies **constant** force and
    acceleration, very high speeds may result if no other forces are involved.
    If you want to maintain a more steady velocity over time, use a
    `Class.LinearVelocity` constraint.
  - If you only need **initial** velocity, set the
    `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity` property
    directly on the assembly.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Force Location

  By default, force is applied to the assembly at the location of
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. Thus, if its center of mass is not
  aligned with the direction/point of force, torque will be applied as well. If
  desired, force can be focused at the center of mass by toggling on
  `Class.VectorForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass`.

  #### Relativity

  By default, force is applied relative to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. If the parent assembly rotates,
  the force will change direction to match the adjusted orientation of the
  attachment; visualize this behavior in how the thruster of a rocket pushes it
  forward, regardless of the rocket's rotation.

  If `Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|World`, force will be applied in world coordinates,
  independent of the parent or attachment orientations; visualize this behavior
  as a directional force like the wind blowing against an object.

  If `Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to
  `Enum.ActuatorRelativeTo|Attachment1`, force will be applied relative to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` and, if the attachment rotates, the
  force will change to match its orientation.

      Whether force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly.
    description: |
      When `true`, force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly
      of `Class.VectorForce.Attachment0|Attachment0`. When `false`, force is
      applied at `Class.VectorForce.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
