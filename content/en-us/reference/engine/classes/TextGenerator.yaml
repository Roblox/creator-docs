name: TextGenerator
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Gives access to a large language model for text generation.
description: |
  A `TextGenerator` instance lets you use a large language model (LLM) to
  generate text based on a system prompt from you and a user prompt from the
  player. The most common use of the API is for creating interactive non-player
  characters (NPCs).

  For example, in a survival experience, your system prompt for a talking animal
  might be
  `"You are a very busy beaver. You end all statements by mentioning how you need to get back to work on your dam."`.
  Users could ask the beaver about water in the area, the size of a nearby
  forest, predators, etc.

  The novelty of LLM responses can help create unique, delightful moments for
  players, but using the API effectively requires a bit of creativity and
  tuning. System prompts can be very extensive, so don't hesitate to include a
  long string with lots of detail.

  #### Rate limits

  Requests are initially limited to 100 per minute, which scales up based on the
  number of concurrent users.

      Sets a fixed seed for the random number generator, allowing reproducible
      responses in cases where the same input parameters are used across
      multiple requests. By setting the same seed value, you can obtain
      identical results for debugging, testing, or evaluation purposes. The
      value of `Seed` should be an integer. Non-integral values will be
      truncated. Default is `0`.

      Provides context to the model about its role, tone, or behavior during the
      conversation. This parameter can guide the model on how to respond,
      setting expectations like `"You are an assistant"` or
      `"Use a formal tone"`.

      Controls the "creativity" or randomness of the model's responses. Values
      closer to `1` increase randomness, while values closer to `0` make the
      responses more focused and deterministic. Values outside the accepted
      range are clamped to the range of `[0.4, 1.0]`. Default is `0.7`.

      Helps the model narrow or expand the range of possible words to sample
      from while generating the next token. This setting narrows the token
      choices to only contain words that together make up a certain percentage
      of total likelihood (for example, 90%). A lower `TopP` means the model
      sticks to closer and more predictable choices, while a higher `TopP` opens
      the door to more diverse and creative responses. Values outside the
      accepted range are clamped to the range of `[0.5, 1.0]`. Default is `0.9`.

      This method returns text generated by an LLM based on the provided system
      and user prompts, as well as any other optional paramaters that have been
      set.

      The `request` argument for this method should be a dictionary with the
      following structure:

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Key Name</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>

      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td><code>UserPrompt</code></td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>Optional prompt from the user that initiates the chat. This could be a question, statement, or command that the user wants the model to respond to.</td>
      <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>ContextToken</code></td>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>Prompt history context token containing a summarization of the previous prompt requests and responses in a conversation up to the current request. If no token is provided, a new token is generated and returned in the response. Providing a previously generated context token restores the conversation state into the current request.</td>
      <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><code>MaxTokens</code></td>
      <td>number</td>
      <td>The maximum number of tokens in the response generated by the model. Expected to be an integer of at least 1. This limits the length of the response, preventing overly long or incomplete answers. Non-integral numbers are rounded to the nearest integer.</td>
      <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      <td>string</td>
      <td>A JSON Schema formatted string that follows the specification at <a href="https://json-schema.org">json-schema.org</a>. When <code>JsonSchema</code> is provided, the model response will conform to the requested format, providing a structured output that can be parsed.</td>

This token can be passed into subsequent requests to maintain the state of the current conversation. Subsequent requests generate new tokens with updated conversation state. Extracting the token and providing it maintains the ongoing conversation context.</td>
