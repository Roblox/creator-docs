      Returns a world space `Datatype.CFrame` looking at the player's character.
    description: |
      Returns a world space `Datatype.CFrame` looking at the player's character,
      such that setting the current camera's `Datatype.CFrame` will view that
      character from the perspective of their device.

      This method leverages the device's camera and
      it only functions on mobile devices. If no information is available, for example
      the user is not on a mobile device or they don't have their camera turned on, this
      method returns a `Datatype.CFrame.identity`.

      See [Roblox Connect](../../../resources/roblox-connect.md) for a sample implementation of this method.
