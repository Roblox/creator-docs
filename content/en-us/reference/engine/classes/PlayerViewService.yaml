      Returns a world space `Datatype.CFrame` looking at the player's character.
    description: |
      Returns a world space `Datatype.CFrame` looking at the player's character,
      such that setting the current camera's `Datatype.CFrame` will view that
      character from the perspective of their device.

      This method leverages the device's camera and it only functions on mobile
      devices. If no information is available, for example the user is not on a
      mobile device or they don't have their camera turned on, this method
      returns a `Datatype.CFrame.identity`.

      See [Roblox Connect](../../../resources/roblox-connect.md) for a sample
      implementation of this method.
