name: ConfigService
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A game service that gives access to in-experience configuration with updates
  in real time.
description: |
  **ConfigService** exposes methods for getting `Class.ConfigSnapshot` objects.
  Configs can only be accessed by game servers, so you can't use
  `Class.ConfigService` within client scripts.

  See [Experience configs](../../../production/configs.md) for an in-depth guide
  on managing keys, deploying real-time updates, error handling, limits, and
  more.

      Clears current testing value for the given key.
    description: |
      Removes a testing override created by the
      `Class.ConfigService:SetTestingValue()|SetTestingValue()` function. The
      actual configured value will be returned after calling this function.

  - name: ConfigService:GetConfigAsync
    summary: |
      Retrieves a snapshot of the latest configuration.
    description: |
      This function retrieves the latest available configuration as a
      `Class.ConfigSnapshot` instance without player targeting. Snapshots can be
      refreshed to the latest values by calling
      `Class.ConfigSnapshot:Refresh()`.

      Experiments are not applied since there is no player context.

      If configuration fails to load and there is no previously available
      configuration, this function throws an error.

      Retrieves the latest available configuration as a `Class.ConfigSnapshot`
      instance targeting to the given player. Snapshots can be refreshed to the
      latest values by calling `Class.ConfigSnapshot:Refresh()`.

      This function applies all experiments running for the player.

      If configuration fails to load and there is no previously available
      configuration, this function throws an error.

      Sets a testing override for the given key.
    description: |
      Sets a testing override for the specified configuration key in the current
      server instance. When a testing value is set, calls to
      `Class.ConfigSnapshot:GetValue()` for that key will return the testing
      value instead of the actual configured value.

      Testing values can be cleared by calling the
      `Class.ConfigService:ClearTestingValue()|ClearTestingValue()` function.
