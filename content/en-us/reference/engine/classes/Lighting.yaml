  The `Lighting` service controls global lighting in an experience. It includes
  a range of adjustable properties that you can use to change how lighting
  appears and interacts with other objects, as summarized in
  [Lighting Properties](../../../environment/lighting.md).

  <img src="../../../assets/lighting-and-effects/lighting-properties/TimeOfDay-17.jpg" width="800" />

  `Lighting` may also contain an `Class.Atmosphere` object to render realistic
  atmospheric effects, including particle density, haze, glare, and color. See
  [Atmospheric Effects](../../../environment/atmosphere.md) for details.

  <img src="../../../assets/lighting-and-effects/atmosphere/Offset-A.jpg" width="800" />

  In addition, `Lighting` (along with `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`) may
  contain
  [post‑processing effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md)
  such as `Class.SunRaysEffect` and `Class.BlurEffect`.

    description: |
      `Ambient` is the lighting hue applied to areas that are occluded from the
      sky, such as indoor areas.

      `Ambient` defaults to `[0, 0, 0]` (black). As long as the red, green, and
      blue channels of this property do not exceed the corresponding channels in
      `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient|OutdoorAmbient`, the change in hue will be
      reserved for areas occluded from the sun/moon.

      Note that when `Class.Lighting.GlobalShadows|GlobalShadows` is disabled,
      there is no distinction between areas occluded from the sky and
      non‑occluded areas. In this case,
      `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient|OutdoorAmbient` will be ignored and the hue
      from the `Ambient` property will be applied everywhere.

      than its default value of <Typography noWrap>`127, 127, 127`</Typography>

      The hue represented in light reflected in the opposite surfaces to those
      facing the sun or moon.

      The surfaces of a `Class.BasePart` influenced by `ColorShift_Bottom`
      depends on the position and orientation of the `Class.BasePart` relative
      to the sun or moon's position. Where the sun is directly overhead a
      `Class.BasePart`, the shift in color will only apply to the bottom
      surface.

      This effect can be increased or reduced by altering
      `Class.Lighting.Brightness|Brightness`.

      Note that `Class.Lighting.ColorShift_Top|ColorShift_Top` and
      `ColorShift_Bottom` will interact with the

      Toggles voxel-based dynamic lighting in the place. When set to `true`,
      shadows are rendered in sheltered areas depending on the position of the
      sun and moon. The lighting hue applied to these sheltered areas is
      determined by the `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` property while the
      lighting hue in all other areas is determined by the
      `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient|OutdoorAmbient` property.

      When `false`, shadows are not drawn and no distinction is made between
      indoor and outdoor areas. As a result, the
      `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` property determines the lighting hue and
      `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient|OutdoorAmbient` will do nothing.

      Shadows are calculated using a voxel system and each lighting voxel is
      4&times;4&times;4 studs. This means objects need to be larger than
      4&times;4&times;4 studs to display a realistic shadow. Shadows are also
      recalculated when `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are moving.

      `OutdoorAmbient` is the lighting hue applied to outdoor areas.

      `OutdoorAmbient` defaults to `[127, 127, 127]`. As long as the red, green,
      and blue channels of `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` do not exceed the
      corresponding channels in `OutdoorAmbient`, the hue of the lighting in
      outdoor areas will be determined by this property.

      The effective `OutdoorAmbient` value is clamped to be greater than or
      equal to `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` in all channels, meaning that if
      a channel of `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` exceeds its corresponding
      `OutdoorAmbient` channel, the hue of `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` will
      begin to apply to outdoor areas.

      Note that when `Class.Lighting.GlobalShadows|GlobalShadows` is disabled,
      there is no distinction between areas occluded from the sky and
      non‑occluded areas. In this case, `OutdoorAmbient` will be ignored and the
      hue from the `Class.Lighting.Ambient|Ambient` property will be applied
      everywhere.

      the moon has "set" and is no longer visible, the `Datatype.Vector3`
      returned by this method will continue to point towards the moon below the
      horizon.

      `Class.Lighting:GetSunDirection()|GetSunDirection()` is a variant of this
      method for obtaining the direction of the sun.

      Sets `Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay|TimeOfDay` and
      `Class.Lighting.ClockTime|ClockTime` to the given number of minutes after
      midnight.

      This method allows a numerical value to be used, for example in a
      day/night cycle `Class.Script`, without the need to convert to a string in
      the format required by `Class.Lighting.TimeOfDay|TimeOfDay`. It also
      allows values greater than 24 hours to be given that correspond to times
      in the next day.

      The following code sample includes a simple day/night cycle script. The
      speed of time and the initial time can be changed using the `TIME_SPEED`
      and `START_TIME` parameters.

      ```lua
      local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")

      local TIME_SPEED = 60  -- 1 min = 1 hour
      local START_TIME = 9  -- 9 AM

      local minutesAfterMidnight = START_TIME * 60
      local waitTime = 60 / TIME_SPEED

      while true do
      	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

      	Lighting:SetMinutesAfterMidnight(minutesAfterMidnight)

      	task.wait(waitTime)
      end

      This event fires when a `Lighting` property is changed or a `Class.Sky` is
      added or removed from `Lighting`, with some exceptions:

      - Changing `Class.Lighting.GlobalShadows|GlobalShadows` will not fire this
        event.
      - Changing fog properties `Class.Lighting.FogColor|FogColor`,
        `Class.Lighting.FogStart|FogStart`, or `Class.Lighting.FogEnd|FogEnd`
        will not fire this event.

      In cases where this behavior is not desired, the `Class.Object.Changed`
      event or `Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()` method can be used.
