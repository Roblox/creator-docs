name: ClickDetector
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object that provides user input on in-experience `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
  and `Class.Model|Models`.
description: |
  `ClickDetector` allows `Class.Script|Scripts` and
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` to receive pointer input on 3D objects
  through their `Class.ClickDetector.MouseClick|MouseClick` event. They work
  when parented to `Class.BasePart`, `Class.Model`, or `Class.Folder` objects.
  They detect basic mouse events: enter, leave, left click and right click.
  Touch input on `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` devices also
  fires click events.

  The default control scripts bind `Enum.KeyCode|ButtonR2` to interact with
  `Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors` using
  `Class.ContextActionService:BindActivate()`, which can also be used to
  override this. When using gamepads, the center dot triggers
  `Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverEnter|MouseHoverEnter` and
  `Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverLeave|MouseHoverLeave`. The bound activation
  button fires `Class.ClickDetector.MouseClick|MouseClick`.

  `Class.ClickDetector.MaxActivationDistance|MaxActivationDistance` can be used
  to limit the distance a player may be from a click detector before it is no
  longer clickable.

  `Class.ClickDetector` events fire on both the client and the server. Since a
  `Class.LocalScript` will only run if it descends from a `Class.Player` or
  player `Class.Player.Character|Character`, it's usually not useful to put a
  `Class.LocalScript` inside a `Class.ClickDetector`, since the script won't run
  or the object won't be clickable. If you need a `Class.LocalScript` to detect
  `Class.ClickDetector` events, `Class.StarterPlayerScripts` may be a better
  place instead.

  #### Input Priority

  If multiple `Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors` may detect user input, only
  the deepest will fire events. If two `Class.ClickDetector|ClickDetectors` are
  siblings, the first will take priority.

  If an action bound with `Class.ContextActionService` uses the same input as a
  `Class.ClickDetector`, the action bound with `Class.ContextActionService` will
  take priority over the click detector's events.

  `Class.UserInputService.InputBegan` will fire before `Class.ClickDetector`
  events.

      Maximum distance between a character and the `Class.ClickDetector` or

    description: |
      This property controls the maximum distance, in studs, between a
      `Class.Player.Character|Character` and the `Class.ClickDetector` or
      `Class.DragDetector` for the player to be able to interact with it. For
      instance, a character within 10 studs of a `Class.ClickDetector` or
      `Class.DragDetector` with a max activation distance of 5 would not be able
      to use the detector because they are out of range.

      Fires when a player interacts with the parent of a `Class.ClickDetector`
      or `Class.DragDetector`.
    description: |
      This event fires from either a `Class.Script` or `Class.LocalScript` when
      a player interacts with a `Class.ClickDetector` or `Class.DragDetector`
      via the following inputs:

      - On platforms with a mouse, when the player left mouse clicks.
      - On `Class.UserInputService.TouchEnabled|TouchEnabled` platforms, when
        the player taps.
      - On `Class.UserInputService.GamepadEnabled|GamepadEnabled` platforms,
        when the center dot is over the same model and the **A** button is
        pressed and released.

      Note that the player's `Class.Player.Character|Character` must be within
      the `Class.ClickDetector.MaxActivationDistance|MaxActivationDistance` of
      the detector.

    description: |
      This event fires from either a `Class.Script` or `Class.LocalScript` when
      the parent of a `Class.ClickDetector` or `Class.DragDetector` is hovered
      over by a player. This does not entail explicit interaction with the
      detector, for which you can listen to either
      `Class.ClickDetector.MouseClick|MouseClick` and
      `Class.ClickDetector.RightMouseClick|RightMouseClick` events.

      Due to the nature of user input, you should not depend on all
      `Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverEnter|MouseHoverEnter` events firing a
      corresponding `Class.ClickDetector.MouseHoverLeave|MouseHoverLeave` event.
