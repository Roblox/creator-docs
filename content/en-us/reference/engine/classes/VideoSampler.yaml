name: VideoSampler
type: class

summary: |
  An object for sampling frames from video content.
description: |
  This object lets you get image frames from selected timestamps of a video. To
  create a `Class.VideoSampler`, call
  `Class.VideoService:CreateVideoSamplerAsync()`.

methods:

    summary: |
      Gets image frames at the specified timestamps.
    description: |
      This method allows you to get a set of image frames from a video at
      specified timestamps as image `Datatype.Content` objects.
    code_samples: []
    parameters:
      - name: times
        type: Array
        default:
        summary: |
          An array of requested timestamps in seconds for which to retrieve
          image frames. Each timestamp should be a number between `0` and
          `Class.VideoSampler.TimeLength|TimeLength`.
    returns:
      - type: Array
        summary: |
          An array of dictionary or nil values for each requested timestamp. If
          a requested timestamp is out of range or the `Class.VideoSampler` was
          unable to produce a sample, the corresponding entry in the returned
          array will be nil.

          Each dictionary contains the following keys:

          - `Time` (number): The timestamp of the returned image frame in
            seconds. This value may differ slightly from the requested
            timestamp.
          - `Image` (`Datatype.Content`): A `Datatype.Content` with a
            `Datatype.Content.SourceType|SourceType` of
            `Enum.ContentSourceType.Opaque` containing the image frame at the
            corresponding timestamp.
