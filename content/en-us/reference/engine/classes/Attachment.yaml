description: |
  An `Class.Attachment` defines a point and orientation relative to a parent
  `Class.BasePart`, `Class.Bone`, or another `Class.Attachment`. The offset is
  stored in the `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` property. The offset can also
  be set through other properties, such as
  `Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame`.

  Attachments are used by several kinds of `Class.Constraint|Constraints` and
  are also valid alternatives to `Class.BasePart` as a parent for objects such
  as:

  - `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters` which will emit particles from the
    attachment's specific position/orientation instead of the `Class.BasePart`
    bounds.
  - Light-emitting objects like `Class.PointLight` and `Class.SpotLight` which
    will shine from the attachment's position/orientation instead of the
    `Class.BasePart` center.
  - `Class.Sound` which will use the attachment's position as the sound's focal
    point, instead of the `Class.BasePart` center.
