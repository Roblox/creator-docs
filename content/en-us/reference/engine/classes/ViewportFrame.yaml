summary: |
  `Class.GuiObject` that renders 3D objects inside its bounds.
description: |
  `ViewportFrame` is a `Class.GuiObject` that renders 3D objects inside its
  bounds, offering a way to display 3D objects in a 2D space like a
  `Class.ScreenGui`. This object has the following caveats:

  - No shadows or
    [post-processing](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md) effects
    are rendered.

  - `Enum.Material.Neon` and `Enum.Material.Glass` materials render at the
    lowest quality.

  - Nested `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` aren't supported.

  - By default, lighting inside a `ViewportFrame` acts as if
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` and
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` are both set to `0`, so properties
    that rely on these fields, such as `Class.SurfaceAppearance.MetalnessMap`,
    may look different.

  - This object can use a `Class.Sky` child as a cubemap for reflections, in
    which case only the `Class.Sky` object's six `Skybox[…]` properties are
    used. Assuming these properties are valid, lighting inside the
    `ViewportFrame` acts similarly to if
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` and
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` are both set to `1`. For details,
    see [here](../../../ui/viewport-frames.md).

    description: |
      `Class.Camera` instance that is used to render children objects. Defaults
      to `nil`.

      The `Class.Camera` object does not replicate so the
      `Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera` won't replicate either. When you set
      this property, `Class.Camera.CFrame` and `Class.Camera.FieldOfView` will
      be saved and replicate with the `ViewportFrame` internally so the client
      can render the frame without a `Class.Camera` object.

    description: |
      This property determines how the rendered viewport image will be
      colorized, allowing you to change the color without directly modifying the
      rendered object. The default colorization value is <Typography
      noWrap>`Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(1, 1, 1)`</Typography> (white) at which
      no color modification occurs.

      See also `Class.ViewportFrame.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency` which
      determines the transparency of the rendered image.

    description: |
      This property determines the transparency of the rendered viewport image,
      allowing you to change the transparency without directly modifying the
      rendered object. A value of `0` (default) is completely opaque and a value
      of `1` is completely transparent (invisible).

      how the rendered image will be colorized.
