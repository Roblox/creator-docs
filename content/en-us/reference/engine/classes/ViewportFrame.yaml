  `Class.GuiObject` that can display children 3D objects.
description: |
  **ViewportFrame** is a `Class.GuiObject` that can render 3D objects inside its
  bounds, offering a way to display 3D objects in a 2D space like a
  `Class.ScreenGui`. This object has the following caveats:

  - No shadows or
    [post-processing](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md) effects
    are rendered.
  - `Enum.Material.Neon` and `Enum.Material.Glass` materials render at the
    lowest quality.
  - Nested `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` aren't supported.
  - By default, lighting inside a `Class.ViewportFrame` acts as if
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` and
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` are both set to 0, so properties
    that rely on these fields, such as `Class.SurfaceAppearance.MetalnessMap`,
    may look different.
  - This object can use a `Class.Sky` child as a cubemap for reflections, in
    which case only the `Class.Sky` object's six **Skybox[…]** properties are
    used. Assuming these properties are valid, lighting inside the
    `Class.ViewportFrame` acts similarly to if
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` and
    `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` are both set to 1. For details, see
    [Frames](../../../ui/frames.md#viewportframe).

      `Class.ViewportFrame`. Defaults to
      `Datatype.Color3|Color3.fromRGB(200, 200, 200)` (ghost grey).

    description: |
      `Class.Camera` instance that is used to render children objects. Defaults
      to `nil`.

      The `Class.Camera` object does not replicate so the
      `Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera` won't replicate either. When you set
      this property, `Class.Camera.CFrame` and `Class.Camera.FieldOfView` will
      be saved and replicate with `Class.ViewportFrame` internally so the client
      can render the frame without a `Class.Camera` object.

    description: |
      This property determines how a rendered image will be colorized, allowing
      you to change the image color without directly modifying the rendered
      object. The default colorization value is
      `Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(1, 1, 1)` (white) at which no color
      modification occurs.

      See also `Class.ViewportFrame.ImageTransparency|ImageTransparency` which
      determines the transparency of the rendered image.

    description: |
      This property determines the transparency of the rendered image, allowing
      you to change the image transparency without directly modifying the
      rendered object. A value of 0 (default) is completely opaque and a value
      of 1 is completely transparent (invisible).
