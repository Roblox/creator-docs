  `Class.GuiObject|GUI` that can display children 3D objects.
description: |
  A **ViewportFrame** is a type of `Class.GuiObject|GUI` that can render 3D
  objects inside its bounds. This is a great way to display 3D objects/models in
  a 2D GUI space like a `Class.ScreenGui`. At the moment, no shadow or post
  effects are available. Neon and Glass `Enum.Material|materials` will be
  rendered on lowest quality. Nested GUIs aren't supported, which means
  GuiObjects don't work as expected under ViewportFrame.

  For a step-by-step walkthrough, see the [Frames](../../../ui/frames.md).

      This property determines the lighting hue applied to the area within the

      `Class.Camera` that is used to render children objects.
    description: |
      This property is a `Class.Camera` instance that is used to render children
      objects. Defaults to _nil_.

      The `Class.Camera` object will not replicate so the
      `Class.ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera` won't replicate either. If you save a
      Camera in the server, it will not appear in the client. When you set this
      property, `Class.Camera.CFrame` and `Class.Camera.FieldOfView` will be
      saved and replicate with `Class.ViewportFrame` internally so the client
      can render ViewportFrame without a Camera object. If you want to change
      the client's Camera, you have to create a new Camera using a
      `Class.LocalScript` at runtime.

    description: |
      This property determines how a rendered image will be colorized. It allows
      you to change the image color without directly modifying the rendered
      object.The default colorization value is
      `Datatype.Color3|Color3.new(1,1,1)` (white). When set to white no
      colorization occurs.

      It functions similarly to `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3` and
      `Class.Decal.Color3`except that it is applied to the rendered image.

      The image below demonstrates the same ViewportFrame with two different
      colorizations. The first image has the default (white) colorization and
      the second image has a `Color3.new(255, 255, 102)` (yellow) colorization.

      Determines the transparency of the rendered image.
    description: |
      This property determines the transparency of the rendered image. It allows
      you to change the image transparency without directly modifying the
      rendered object. A value of 0 is completely opaque, and a value of 1 is
      completely transparent (invisible). The default transparency is 0.

      This property behaves similarly to
      `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` or `Class.BasePart.Transparency`
      except that it is applied to the rendered image.

      The image below demonstrates the same ViewportFrame with two different
      transparency. The first image has a transparency of 0 and the second image
      has a transparency of 0.5.
