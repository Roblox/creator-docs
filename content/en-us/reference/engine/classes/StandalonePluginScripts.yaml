  **StandalonePluginScripts** is a container of `Class.Script|Scripts` to be run
  in a standalone plugin `Class.DataModel` when Roblox Studio starts (it is not
  useful outside the context of plugins). When a place to be edited is loaded in
  Roblox Studio, scripts inside this container are not run.

  #### Limited Functionality and Availabilty
  
  Throughout the history of this instance, its functionality has been enabled
  and disabled without notice. Before doing any work with it, make sure to verify
  that it works as expected before continuing with further work.

  Seemingly, when enabled, **StandalonePluginScripts** work only with Local 
  `Class.Plugin|Plugins`.
