  The `Class.ScreenshotHud` is a 2D user interface that allows users to capture
  and save screenshots to their local device. It consists of the following UI
  elements:

  - An overlay containing the experience name and Roblox branding. These remain
    on screen when a screenshot is taken, although the experience name can be
    disabled through the `Class.ScreenshotHud.ExperienceNameOverlayEnabled`
    property.
  - A camera button that hides all UI except for the overlay and takes a
    screenshot.
  - A close button that closes the `Class.ScreenshotHud`.
