name: RigidConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Creates a rigid connection between two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or
  `Class.Bone|Bones`.
description: |
  **RigidConstraint** connects two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or
  `Class.Bone|Bones` and ensures they stay in the same relative
  position/orientation to each other. This flexibility gives it additional
  functionality beyond `Class.WeldConstraint`, such as attaching accessories to
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments` on a character rig.

  The fastest way to create this constraint is by selecting
  **Rigid&nbsp;Constraint** through Studio's **Create** menu in the toolbar's
  **Model** tab.

  Note that this tool behaves differently depending on whether you click on
  existing `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`, `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, or
  `Class.Bone|Bones` after the tool is activated:

  - Clicking on an existing `Class.BasePart` creates a new `Class.Attachment`
    upon it as the intended `Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment0` or
    `Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment1`.
  - Clicking on an existing `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone` uses that
    instance as the intended `Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment0` or
    `Class.RigidConstraint.Attachment1`.

  Following the second valid click, a new `Class.RigidConstraint` is created to
  connect the two new attachments. If either the first or second click is
  **not** made on a `Class.BasePart`, `Class.Attachment`, or `Class.Bone`, the
  workflow is canceled and no constraint is created.
