  The `Class.Team` class represents a faction in a Roblox place. The only valid
  parent for a Team is in the `Class.Teams` service. Teams offer a range of
  features that are useful to developers that can be divided into two rough
  groups:

  - Features that work 'out of the box'
  - Features developers can program into their game.

  **Built-in Team Behavior**

  The following functionality of Teams exists by default and does not require
  the developer to program any custom behavior.

  - When part of a Team, the name above a player's character `Class.Model` will
    be colored to the `Class.Team.TeamColor`
  - Changing `Class.Player.TeamColor` will cause `Class.Player.Team` to switch
    to the Team with the corresponding `Class.Team.TeamColor`
  - When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed
    together as a team
  - Setting `Class.Player.Neutral` to true will cause the `Class.Player` to be
    disassociated with the team, however, it will not change `Class.Player.Team`
    or `Class.Player.TeamColor`
  - When a `Class.Player` joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with
    `Class.Team.AutoAssignable` set to true that has the fewest players. If no
    auto assignable team is available, `Class.Player.Neutral` will be set to
    true
  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` is set to false, only players whose
    `Class.Player.TeamColor` matches `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` can spawn
    on that `Class.SpawnLocation`
  - When `Class.SpawnLocation.AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` is set to true, a player's
    `Class.Player.TeamColor` will change to `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` when
    their character touches the `Class.SpawnLocation`

  **Optional Extended Team Behaviors**

  Many developers chose to add the following features to teams in their own
  code.

  - Implement checks in weapon code to prevent friendly fire.
  - Implement checks in doors or other features that allow only certain teams to
    use them
  - Periodically reassign teams to maintain team balance

      This property determines whether `Class.Player|Players` will be
      automatically placed onto the `Class.Team` when joining. If multiple teams
      have this property set to true, Roblox will attempt to even the teams out
      when `Class.Player|Players` are added.

      when `Class.Player|Players` are added.

      When a `Class.Player` joins a game they will be assigned to the
      `Class.Team` with `Class.Team.AutoAssignable` set to true that has the
      fewest players. If no such team is available, `Class.Player.Neutral` will
      be set to true.

      Note while using this property will help even out teams when players are
      added, it will not do anything when players are removed. For this reason
      developers may wish to implement their own team balancing system.

    summary: |
      This property sets the color of the `Class.Team`. Determines the
      `Class.Player.TeamColor` property of players who are a member of the team.
      Also determines the color displayed on the player list and above player's
      heads.

      This property sets the color of the `Class.Team`. Determines the
      `Class.Player.TeamColor` property of players who are a member of the team.

      A lot of Roblox's default team functionality is based on the team color,
      rather than the name or object. For example,
      `Class.SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations` can be assigned to a team via
      `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor`. For this reason it is recommended that
      developers ensure each `Class.Team` has a unique TeamColor.

      Any player which is a part of a team will have their name color changed to
      the team's TeamColor property. They will also be put underneath the team
      heading on the player list.

      Returns a list of `Class.Player|Players` who are assigned to the

      This function has a number of potential uses, including counting the
      number of players on a `Class.Team` or giving every `Class.Player` on a
      `Class.Team` a `Class.Tool`.

    summary: |
      Fires whenever a `Class.Player` is assigned to the `Class.Team`. A player

      the `Class.Team` and `Class.Player.Neutral` is false.

      is considered assigned if their `Class.Player.Team` property is equal to

      This event is team specific and will only fire when a `Class.Player`
      joints the specific `Class.Team`. Any function connected to this event
      will be passed the `Class.Player` object of the player who joined the
      team. For example:

          Team.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
          	print(player.Name.." has joined the team")
          end)

      Fires whenever a `Class.Player` is removed from a `Class.Team`. This can

      being set to true or the `Class.Player` joining a different team.
