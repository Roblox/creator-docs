  Makes audio more voluminous by simulating multiple voices playing the same
  part.
description: |
  A ChorusSoundEffect simulates the effect of multiple vocals or instruments
  playing the same part. It does this by taking the original sound and
  overlaying copies of that sound. These copies are not exact matches to the
  original but instead vary in pitch slightly. This simulates a real chorus, as
  different singers or instruments will have slight variations. This effect can
  be applied to either an individual sound or to a sound group by parenting it
  to the desired instance.

  Like all other `Class.SoundEffect`, a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either
  to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
