  A form of `Class.BasePart` that includes a physically simulated custom mesh.
description: |
  `Class.MeshPart` is a form of `Class.BasePart` that includes a physically
  simulated custom mesh. Unlike with other mesh classes, such as
  `Class.SpecialMesh` and `Class.BlockMesh`, they are not parented to a
  `Class.BasePart` but rather behave as a `Class.BasePart` in their own right.

  The mesh and texture of a `Class.MeshPart` are determined by the
  `Class.MeshPart.MeshId|MeshId` and `Class.MeshPart.TextureID|TextureID`
  properties. For more information, see [Meshes](../../../parts/meshes.md).

      This property determines whether to render both faces of polygons in the
      mesh. It is only changeable in Studio. This is useful for meshes that are
      typically modeled as "cards" such as a leaf, hair, or cloth.

      This property determines the level of detail that the `Class.MeshPart`
      will be shown in. It can be set to the possible values of the
      `Enum.RenderFidelity` enum.

      The default value is `Enum.RenderFidelity.Automatic|Automatic`, meaning
      the mesh's detail is based on its distance from the camera as outlined in
      the following table.

      The texture applied to the `Class.MeshPart`. Supports
      [asset URIs](../../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-uris) and
      `Class.EditableImage` objects.

      When this property is set to `Datatype.Content.none`, no texture will be
      applied to the mesh.

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local meshPart = Workspace.MeshPart
      meshPart.TextureContent = Content.none  -- No texture
      ```

      Note that the `Class.MeshPart.MeshContent|MeshContent` property cannot be
      directly changed during runtime but the texture can.

      ##### Changing a Mesh Texture

      Using the `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent` property, the
      texture of a mesh can be changed without having to re-upload the mesh. To
      do this, a new image can be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture.
      The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh
      using the **Export Selection** option in Studio. The image file will be
      saved alongside the exported `.obj` file.

      The new texture can then be uploaded to Roblox as a decal and its
      [asset URI](../../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-uris) can be applied
      to the mesh using the `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent` or
      `Class.MeshPart.TextureID|TextureID` property.

      `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent` can also be set to
      reference an `Class.EditableImage` that has not been published yet.

      ```
      local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local meshPart = Workspace.MeshPart

      local editableImage = AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync(meshPart.TextureContent)
      meshPart.TextureContent = Content.fromObject(editableImage)  -- Live updates
      ```

      When `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent|TextureContent` references an
      `Class.EditableImage`, the texture will live update with any edits to the
      `Class.EditableImage` object.

      ##### Making a Textured Mesh

      A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped, referring to
      the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done
      using Roblox Studio and must be done using an external 3D modeling
      application such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
