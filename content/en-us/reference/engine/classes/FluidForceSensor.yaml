name: FluidForceSensor
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A `Class.SensorBase` that outputs `Class.FluidForceSensor.Force|Force`,
  `Class.FluidForceSensor.Torque|Torque` and
  `Class.FluidForceSensor.CenterOfPressure|CenterOfPressure`.
description: |
  `FluidForceSensor` is a `Class.SensorBase` which outputs the results of fluid
  force simulation from the last physics frame for the part it is attached to.
  The sensor outputs the `Class.FluidForceSensor.Force|Force`,
  `Class.FluidForceSensor.Torque|Torque` and
  `Class.FluidForceSensor.CenterOfPressure|CenterOfPressure` which were computed
  by the fluid force simulation on the last physics frame.
