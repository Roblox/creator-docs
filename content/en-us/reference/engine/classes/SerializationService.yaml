      Deserializes a `Library.buffer` containing `.rbxm` content, returning a list of `Class.Instance|instances`.
      
      This API can only be called from Studio plugins or Open Cloud Luau Execution Sessions. If non-creatable
      instances or services are included in the content, an error is thrown.

      No stability contract is offered for the `.rbxm` format and the composition of this data may change at
      any time. This API will faithfully parse `.rbxm` content that was serialized by the Roblox engine,
      including `.rbxm` files generated by Studio or via
      `Class.SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync()|SerializeInstancesAsync()`.

      Although it is possible to use this API to deserialize `.rbxm` content generated by any other means,
      this is done at the user's own risk. The engine may fail to deserialize such content faithfully, or at all.

      No stability contract is offered for the `.rbxm` format and the composition of this data may
      change at any time. This API will serialize content according to the serialization behavior of the
      current engine version.
      
      Although it is possible for other tools to parse `.rbxm` content, this is done at the user's own risk.
      The engine may still generate `.rbxm` content that 3rd-party tools fail to parse faithfully.
