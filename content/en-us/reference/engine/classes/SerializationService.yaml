      Deserializes a `Library.buffer` containing `.rbxm` content, returning a
      list of `Class.Instance|instances`.

      This API can only be called from Studio plugins or Open Cloud Luau
      Execution Sessions. If non-creatable instances or services are included in
      the content, an error is thrown.

      No stability contract is offered for the `.rbxm` format and the
      composition of this data may change at any time. This API will faithfully
      parse `.rbxm` content that was serialized by the Roblox engine, including
      `.rbxm` files generated by Studio or via
      `Class.SerializationService:SerializeInstancesAsync()|SerializeInstancesAsync()`.

      Although it is possible to use this API to deserialize `.rbxm` content
      generated by any other means, this is done at the user's own risk. The
      engine may fail to deserialize such content faithfully, or at all.

      Serializes a list of `Class.Instance|instances` to the `.rbxm` format,
      returning a `Library.buffer` or `.rbxm` content.

      This API can only be called from Studio plugins or Open Cloud Luau

      the list of instances, an error is thrown.

      No stability contract is offered for the `.rbxm` format and the
      composition of this data may change at any time. This API will serialize
      content according to the serialization behavior of the current engine
      version.

      Although it is possible for other tools to parse `.rbxm` content, this is
      done at the user's own risk. The engine may still generate `.rbxm` content
      that 3rd-party tools fail to parse faithfully.
