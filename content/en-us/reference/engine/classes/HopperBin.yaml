summary: ''
description: |
  HopperBins are an outdated system for creating tools that can be used by a
  player. In place of HopperBins, please use `Class.Tool` instead.

  Historically, only HopperBins worked without a 'Handle' `Class.Part`, but this
  is no longer the case thanks to the `Class.Tool.RequiresHandle` property of
  Tools.
