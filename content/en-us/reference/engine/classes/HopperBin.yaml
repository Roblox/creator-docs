  HopperBins are an outdated system for creating tools that can be used by a
  player. In place of HopperBins, please use `Class.Tool` instead.

  Historically, only HopperBins worked without a 'Handle' `Class.Part`, but this
  is no longer the case thanks to the `Class.Tool.RequiresHandle` property of
  Tools.

  For capturing user input (from the Mouse for example), it is no longer
  necessary to use HopperBins or Tools. Instead, please use these alternatives:

  - `Class.ContextActionService`
  - `Class.UserInputService`
  - `Class.Player:GetMouse()`
