name: WireframeHandleAdornment
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Renders a wireframe adornment consisting of one or more lines onto a
  `Class.BasePart` (including `Class.Terrain`) or into the `Class.Workspace`.
description: |
  `WireframeHandleAdornment` renders a wireframe adornment consisting of one or
  more lines onto a `Class.BasePart` (including `Class.Terrain`) or into the
  `Class.Workspace`. If parented to a player's `Class.PlayerGui` or the
  `Class.CoreGui`, this adornment can listen to input events for purposes such
  as making dragger tools.

  Note that a `WireframeHandleAdornment` instance **begins empty** and you must
  add lines or paths to it through methods like
  `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddLines()|AddLines()` or
  `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddPath()|AddPath()`.

  The rendered wireframe can be customized visually through its
  `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Thickness|Thickness`,
  `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Color3|Color3`, and
  `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Transparency|Transparency` properties,
  although these properties only affect subsequent draws and do not update lines
  already drawn into the adornment.

    summary: |
      The **XYZ** scale of the wireframe adornment.
    description: |
      This property specifies the **XYZ** scale of the wireframe adornment as a
      `Datatype.Vector3`. For example, a scale of
      `Datatype.Vector3.new(1, 2, 1)` will scale the adornment twice its normal
      size on the **Y** axis while keeping the **X** and **Z** axes unchanged.

      This property determines the thickness of the wireframe adornment's lines
      in pixels. Note that this visual thickness does not change relative to the
      adornment's distance from the viewer's camera.

    summary: |
      Adds a line to the wireframe adornment from a starting point to an ending
      point relative to the center of the
      `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`.
    description: |
      This method adds a line to the wireframe adornment from a starting point
      to an ending point, both defined as a `Datatype.Vector3` relative to the
      center of the `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`.

      Note that you can make a multicolor wireframe by changing the adornment's
      `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Color3|Color3` property before new lines
      are drawn via `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddLine()|AddLine()`, as
      demonstrated in the following code sample.

      Adds one or more lines to the wireframe adornment using an array.
    description: |
      This method adds one or more lines of the current
      `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Color3|Color3` color to the wireframe
      adornment using an array. Each pair of `Datatype.Vector3` points in the
      array acts as a starting point and ending point for a line, relative to
      the center of the `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`.

      Note that lines are rendered independently and their ending points are not
      connected to the starting point of any other line. To connect multiple
      line segments in a sequence from point to point, see
      `Class.WireframeHandleAdornment:AddPath()|AddPath()`.

      (ending point connected to starting point) by setting the `loop` parameter
