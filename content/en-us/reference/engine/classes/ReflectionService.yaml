name: ReflectionService
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: ''

  `ReflectionService` allows scripts to query the engine for details about its
  API, including required security permissions, functionality, and inheritance
  structure. You can use this service to dynamically inspect classes and their
  properties, which can be useful for debugging, tooling, or creating dynamic
  behaviors based on the engine's capabilities.

  The following is an example script that inspects classes and their properties:

  ```lua
  local ReflectionService = game:GetService("ReflectionService")

  -- Create a SecurityCapabilities object with all capabilities
  local allCapabilities = SecurityCapabilities.new(table.unpack(Enum.SecurityCapability:GetEnumItems()))

  -- Get all classes accessible with all capabilities
  local allClasses = ReflectionService:GetClasses({ Security = allCapabilities })
  print("Total classes:", #allClasses)

  -- Get a specific class
  local partClass = ReflectionService:GetClass("Part")
  if partClass then
  	print("\nPart class:")
  	print("  Name:", partClass.Name)
  	print("  Superclass:", partClass.Superclass and tostring(partClass.Superclass) or "none")
  end

  -- Get the first 5 properties of a class
  local properties = ReflectionService:GetPropertiesOfClass("Part", { Security = allCapabilities })
  print("\nPart properties:", #properties)
  for i = 1, math.min(5, #properties) do
  	print("  -", properties[i].Name)
  end
  ```

      Returns information about a class when given its name, assuming that class
      is accessible.

      Given a class name in the Roblox API, returns a `ReflectedClass`
      dictionary with information about the associated class's reflection state.
      If no such class name exists, returns `nil`.

      If you pass in a `ReflectionClassFilter` dictionary, you can adjust the
      set of eligible classes and adjust the output behavior:

      ```lua
      {
      	-- The security context to use. Can be more expansive than the current script's security.
      	Security: SecurityCapabilities?, -- default: SecurityCapabilities.fromCurrent()
      	-- Require classes to derive from the passed-in class name.
      	IsA: string?, -- default: nil
      	-- Whether to exclude Studio display information about the class.
      	ExcludeDisplay: boolean?, -- default: false
      }
      ```

      If the class name is valid, you'll get the following `ReflectedClass`
      dictionary as output:

      ```lua
      {
      	-- The name of the class.
      	Name: string,
      	-- The class's parent in the instance hierarchy (unless it's the root).
      	Superclass: string?,
      	-- The names of the class's direct children in the instance hierarchy.
      	Subclasses: {string},
      	-- Studio display information.
      	Display: {
      		-- Always "General" for classes.
      		Category: string,
      		-- A message indicating that the class is deprecated, if applicable.
      		DeprecationMessage: string?,
      	}?,
      	-- The security permissions required to access this class.
      	Permits: {
      		-- If the class is a Service, the security capabilities required to obtain access. If not applicable, this field isn't present.
      		GetService: SecurityCapabilities?,
      		-- The security capabilities required to create an instance of this class. If not possible, this field isn't present.
      		New: SecurityCapabilities?,
      	}
      }

      Returns a list of `ReflectedClass` dictionaries for all classes in the
      Roblox API that match the provided filter criteria.

      If you pass in a `ReflectionClassFilter` dictionary, you can adjust the
      set of eligible classes and adjust the output behavior:

      ```lua
      {
      	-- The security context to use. Can be more expansive than the current script's security.
      	Security: SecurityCapabilities?, -- default: SecurityCapabilities.fromCurrent()
      	-- Require classes to derive from the passed-in class name.

      	-- Whether to exclude Studio display information about the classes.
      	ExcludeDisplay: boolean?, -- default: false
      }
      ```

      You'll get a list of `ReflectedClass` dictionaries as output, each with
      the same structure as described in the `GetClass` method. If there are no
      classes that match the filter criteria, you'll receive an empty list.

      Given a class name in the Roblox API, returns a list of
      `ReflectedProperty` dictionaries for all properties of that class that
      match the provided filter criteria. If no such class name exists, returns
      `nil`.

      If you pass in a `ReflectionMemberFilter` dictionary, you can adjust the
      set of eligible properties and adjust the output behavior:

      ```lua

      	-- The security context to use. Can be more expansive than the current script's security.

      	-- Whether to exclude Studio display information about the properties.
      	ExcludeDisplay: boolean?, -- default: false
      }
      ```

      If the class name is valid and that class has properties, you'll get a
      list of `ReflectedProperty` dictionaries as output, each with the
      following structure:

      ```lua
