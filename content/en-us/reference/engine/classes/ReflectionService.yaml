  `ReflectionService` allows scripts to query the engine for details about its
  API, including required security permissions, functionality, and inheritance
  structure. You can use this service to dynamically inspect classes and their
  properties, methods, and events, which can be useful for debugging, tooling,
  or creating dynamic behaviors based on the engine's capabilities.

  The following is an example script that inspects classes and their properties:

  ```lua
  local ReflectionService = game:GetService("ReflectionService")

  -- Create a SecurityCapabilities object with all capabilities
  local allCapabilities = SecurityCapabilities.new(table.unpack(Enum.SecurityCapability:GetEnumItems()))

  -- Get all classes accessible with all capabilities
  local allClasses = ReflectionService:GetClasses({ Security = allCapabilities })
  print("Total classes:", #allClasses)

  -- Get a specific class
  local partClass = ReflectionService:GetClass("Part")
  if partClass then
  	print("\nPart class:")
  	print("  Name:", partClass.Name)
  	print("  Superclass:", partClass.Superclass and tostring(partClass.Superclass) or "none")
  end

  -- Get the first 5 properties of a class
  local properties = ReflectionService:GetPropertiesOfClass("Part", { Security = allCapabilities })
  print("\nPart properties:", #properties)
  for i = 1, math.min(5, #properties) do
  	print("  -", properties[i].Name)
  end
  ```

      Returns information about a class when given its name, assuming that class
      is accessible.

      Given a class name in the Roblox API, returns a `ReflectedClass`
      dictionary with information about the associated class's reflection state.
      If no such class name exists, returns `nil`.

      If you pass in a `ReflectionClassFilter` dictionary, you can adjust the
      set of eligible classes and adjust the output behavior:

      ```lua
      {
      	-- The security context to use; can be more expansive than the current script's security
      	Security: SecurityCapabilities?, -- default: SecurityCapabilities.fromCurrent()
      	-- Require classes to derive from the passed-in class name
      	IsA: string?, -- default: nil
      	-- Whether to exclude Studio display information about the class
      	ExcludeDisplay: boolean?, -- default: false
      }
      ```

      If the class name is valid, you'll get the following `ReflectedClass`
      dictionary as output:

      ```lua
      {
      	-- The name of the class
      	Name: string,
      	-- Whether the class is serialized (able to be saved to disk)
      	Serialized: boolean,
      	-- The class's parent in the instance hierarchy (unless it's the root)
      	Superclass: string?,
      	-- The names of the class's direct children in the instance hierarchy
      	Subclasses: {string},
      	-- Studio display information
      	Display: {
      		-- Always "General" for classes
      		Category: string,
      		-- A message indicating that the class is deprecated, if applicable
      		DeprecationMessage: string?,

      Returns a list of `ReflectedClass` dictionaries for all classes in the
      Roblox API that match the provided filter criteria.

      If you pass in a `ReflectionClassFilter` dictionary, you can adjust the
      set of eligible classes and adjust the output behavior:

      ```lua

      You'll get a list of `ReflectedClass` dictionaries as output, each with
      the same structure as described in the `GetClass` method. If there are no
      classes that match the filter criteria, you'll receive an empty list.
