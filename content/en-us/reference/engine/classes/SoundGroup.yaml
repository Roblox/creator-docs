  A `Class.SoundGroup` is used to manage the volume and effects on multiple
  `Class.Sound|Sounds` at once. Every sound in the sound group will have its
  volume adjusted by the group's `Class.SoundGroup.Volume` property. If the
  SoundGroup has any `Class.SoundEffect|SoundEffects` as children, those effects
  will be applied to all of the `Class.Sound|Sounds` in the group.

  The `Class.SoundGroup.Volume` property acts as a multiplier, and thus sounds
  in a SoundGroup will retain their relative volumes when it is set. This means
  if a sound's volume is 0.5 and it is assigned to a SoundGroup with a volume of
  0.5, its effective volume will be 0.25.

  Grouping sounds of the same category has several uses for developers. One
  common usage of a sound group is to assign all of the music that can play in
  game to a SoundGroup called "music." Players could then easily toggle all
  music on or off.

  ## Setting sound groups

  A `Class.Sound` is added to a `Class.SoundGroup` by setting the
  `Class.Sound.SoundGroup` property of the `Class.Sound`. A `Class.Sound` can
  only be in one `Class.SoundGroup` at a time. Whilst they can be parented
  elsewhere, it is recommended to keep SoundGroups parented to the
  `Class.SoundService`. In the below example, a sound is parented to a
  SoundGroup called 'Music'.

      Sound.SoundGroup = game:GetService("SoundService"):FindFirstChild("Music")
