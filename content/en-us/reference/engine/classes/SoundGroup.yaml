name: SoundGroup
type: class
memory_category: Internal

  A `Class.SoundGroup` is used to manage the volume and sound effects on
  multiple `Class.Sound|Sounds` at once. `Class.Sound|Sounds` in the SoundGroup
  will have their volume and effects adjusted by the SoundGroup.

  A `Class.SoundGroup` is used to manage the volume and effects on multiple
  `Class.Sound|Sounds` at once. Every sound in the sound group will have its
  volume adjusted by the group's `Class.SoundGroup.Volume|Volume` property which
  acts as a multiplier, meaning a `Class.Sound` with volume `0.5` assigned to a
  `Class.SoundGroup` with a volume of `0.5` will have an effective volume of
  `0.25`.

  If the `Class.SoundGroup` has any `Class.SoundEffect|SoundEffects` as
  children, those effects will be applied to all of the `Class.Sound|Sounds` in
  the group.

  Note that a `Class.Sound` must be added to a `Class.SoundGroup` by setting its
  `Class.Sound.SoundGroup|SoundGroup` property, not by simply parenting the
  `Class.Sound` to the `Class.SoundGroup`. A `Class.Sound` can only belong to
  one `Class.SoundGroup` at a time, although you can nest groups as outlined
  [here](../../../sound/groups.md#nesting-soundgroups).

  See [Sound Groups](../../../sound/groups.md) for further details on working
  with the `Class.SoundGroup` class.
