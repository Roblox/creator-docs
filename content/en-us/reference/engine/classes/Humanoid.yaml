  A special object that gives models the functionality of a character.
description: |
  The Humanoid is a special object that gives models the functionality of a
  character. It grants the model with the ability to physically walk around and
  interact with various components of a Roblox experience. Humanoids are always
  parented inside of a `Class.Model`, and the model is expected to be an
  assembly of `Class.BasePart` and `Class.Motor6D`; the root part of the
  assembly is expected to be named `HumanoidRootPart`. It also expects a part
  named `Head` to be connected to the character's torso part, either directly or
  indirectly. By default, there are two official types of character rigs
  supplied by Roblox, each with their own set of rules:

  ## R6

  - A basic character rig that uses 6 parts for limbs.
  - The `Head` part must be attached to a part named `Torso`, or the Humanoid
    will die immediately.
  - BodyPart appearances are applied using `Class.CharacterMesh` objects.
  - Certain properties, such as `Class.Humanoid.LeftLeg` and
    `Class.Humanoid.RightLeg`, only work with R6.

  ## R15

  - More complex than R6, but also far more flexible and robust.
  - Uses 15 parts for limbs.
  - The `Head` part must be attached to a part named `UpperTorso` or the
    Humanoid will die immediately.
  - BodyPart appearances have to be assembled directly.
  - Can be dynamically rescaled by using special `Class.NumberValue` objects
    parented inside of the Humanoid.
  - The Humanoid will automatically create `Class.Vector3Value` objects named
    `OriginalSize` inside of each limb.
  - If a NumberValue is parented inside of the Humanoid and is named one of the
    following, it will be used to control the scaling functionality:
    - BodyDepthScale
    - BodyHeightScale
    - BodyWidthScale
    - HeadScale

    summary: |
      Sets whether the character will automatically jump when they hit an
      obstacle as a player on a mobile device.
    description: |
      AutoJumpEnabled sets whether or not the `Class.Humanoid` will attempt to
      automatically jump over an obstacle it is walking towards.

      Currently, this property only works when the following conditions are
      true:

      - The Humanoid's character model is the `Class.Player.Character` of a
        `Class.Player`.
      - The Player in question is using touch controls.

      When a player's character spawns, the property's value matches the
      player's `Class.Player.AutoJumpEnabled` property - which in turn matches
      the `Class.StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled` property.

      The Humanoid has six child scale values including `BodyDepthScale`,
      `BodyHeightScale`, `BodyProportionScale`, `BodyTypeScale`,
      `BodyWidthScale`, `HeadScale`. Changing the value of any of these causes
      the character's body parts and accessories to change size, but only if
      `AutomaticScalingEnabled` is true.

    summary: |
      AutoRotate sets whether or not the Humanoid will automatically rotate to
      face in the direction they are moving in.
    description: |
      The AutoRotate property describes whether or not the Humanoid will
      automatically rotate to face in the direction they are moving. When set to
      true, the character model will gradually turn to face their movement
      direction as the Humanoid walks around. When set to false, the character
      model will remain fixated in its current rotation, unless a rotating force
      is applied to the _HumanoidRootPart_.

      If the character model happens to be the character of a player, then the
      behavior of the Humanoid's rotation is influenced by the UserGameSetting's
      RotateType property.

      When the AutoRotate property is set to true, the RotateType property has
      the following effects on the Humanoid's rotation:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>RotationType</th>
      			<th>Behavior</th>
      			<th>Context</th>

      The CameraOffset property specifies an offset to the camera's subject
      position when its `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` is set to this
      `Class.Humanoid`.

      The offset is applied in object-space, relative to the orientation of the
      Humanoid's _HumanoidRootPart_. For example, an offset `Datatype.Vector3`
      value of _(0, 10, 0)_ offsets the player's camera to 10 studs above the
      player's humanoid.

      Controls the distance behavior of the humanoid's name and health display.
    description: |
      The **DisplayDistanceType** property controls the distance behavior of the
      humanoid's name and health display. This property is set using the
      `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType` enum with three available values, each
      with their own set of rules:

      - When set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|Viewer`, the humanoid sees
        the name/health of other humanoids within range of its own
        `NameDisplayDistance` and `HealthDisplayDistance`.
      - When set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|Subject`, the humanoid
        takes **full control** over its own name and health display through its
        `NameDisplayDistance` and `HealthDisplayDistance` values.
      - When set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|None`, the humanoid's name
        and health bar do not appear under any circumstances.

      See
      [Character Name/Health Display](../../../characters/name-health-display.md)
      for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and
      health bars.

    summary: |
      Sets the text of a Humanoid, displayed above their head.
    description: |
      `DisplayName` is a property that determines the Humanoid's name display
      when visible. By default, a new Humanoid will have the value of an empty
      string. If `DisplayName` is an empty string, the humanoid's name display
      will default to the humanoid's parent's name property.

      #### Player Character Loading

      When players load their character, either automatically or through the use
      of `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()|LoadCharacterAsync()`, the Humanoid
      that is created by the engine will have its `DisplayName` property set to
      the player's `DisplayName` property.

      #### StarterCharacter and StarterHumanoid

      When a `Class.Humanoid` named `StarterHumanoid` is parented to
      `Class.StarterPlayer`, or when a Humanoid is present in a Model named
      `StarterCharacter`, the DisplayName property will be respected when
      Characters are loaded by Players in the game. The engine will only
      override the `DisplayName` property of the Humanoid with the `DisplayName`
      property of the player if the `Class.Humanoid.DisplayName` of
      `StarterHumanoid` is an empty string.

      #### What does turning this off do?

      - **No forces** - The humanoid will not apply forces to any of its parts.
        The humanoid will not move the character in any way.
      - **No sensors** - The humanoid will not run any spatial queries to detect
        floors, ladders, or other obstacles (such as auto-jump).
      - **No collision changes** - The humanoid will not alter the collision
        state of any of the character parts. By default, only the torso and head
        have `Class.Part.CanCollide` enabled.
      - **No state transitions or replication** - The humanoid will not
        automatically update its state. You can still set humanoid state with a
        script, but it will not automatically replicate.

      #### What does turning this off **not** do?

      - **State events** - If manually setting humanoid states, the events for
        each of the humanoid's states and
        `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged|StateChanged` will still fire, which means
        the Animate script will still receive them and animate the character
        based on its current humanoid state.
      - **Appearance** - `Class.HumanoidDescription`, clothes, accessories and
        other humanoid rendering behavior.
      - **Camera and player scripts** - The humanoid is still linked to
        `Class.Players` and camera scripts, which ensures the camera will
        continue to follow the `Class.Humanoid.RootPart`.
      - **Player input handling** - The `Class.Humanoid.MoveDirection` property
        will still be updated via the `Class.Humanoid:Move()` function and
        `Class.PlayerScripts` for input.

    summary: |
      Describes the `Enum.Material` that the `Class.Humanoid` is currently
      standing on. If the `Class.Humanoid` isn't standing on anything, the value
      of this property will be _Air_.
    description: |
      This is a read-only property that describes the `Enum.Material` the
      `Class.Humanoid` is currently standing on. It works with both regular
      `Class.BasePart|Parts` and `Class.Terrain` voxels.

      The code sample below demonstrates how to listen to when this property
      changes using `Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()`. When the material
      the humanoid is standing on changes, it will print a message indicating
      the new material being stood on.

      ```lua
      local Humanoid = route.to.humanoid

      Humanoid:GetPropertyChangedSignal("FloorMaterial"):Connect(function()
      	print("New value for FloorMaterial: " .. tostring(Humanoid.FloorMaterial))
      end)
      ```

      #### Caveats

      - When the `Class.Humanoid` is not standing on a floor, the value of this
        property will be set to _Air_.
        - This occurs because Enum properties cannot have an empty value.
        - This can cause some confusion if a part has its material is set to
          Air, though in practice, parts are not supposed to use that material
          in the first place.
      - The character model of the `Class.Humanoid` must be able to collide with
        the floor, or else it will not be detected.
        - You cannot test if the `Class.Humanoid` is swimming with this
          property. You should instead use its `Class.Humanoid:GetState()`
          function.

    summary: |
      Describes the current health of the Humanoid on the range [0,
      `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth`].
    description: |
      This property represents the current health of the `Class.Humanoid`. The
      value is restricted to the range between 0 and
      `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth`. If the humanoid is dead, this
      property is continually set to 0.

      Note that the `Class.Humanoid:TakeDamage()|TakeDamage()` function may be
      used to subtract from `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` instead of setting
      the property directly.

      #### Health Regeneration

      By default, a passive health regeneration script is automatically inserted
      into humanoids. This causes non-dead player characters to regenerate 1% of
      `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth` each second. To disable this
      regeneration behavior, add an empty `Class.Script` named **Health** to
      `Class.StarterCharacterScripts`.

      #### Health Bar Display

      When `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` is less than
      `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth`, a health bar is displayed
      in-experience. The display behavior of the health bar is dependent on the
      `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance` and
      `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType`.

      See
      [Character Name/Health Display](../../../characters/name-health-display.md)
      for an in-depth guide on controlling the appearance of character names and
      health bars.

      #### Death

      When the value of the character's health reaches 0, the `Class.Humanoid`
      automatically transitions to the `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Dead` state. In
      this state, `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` is locked to 0; however, there
      is no error or warning for setting the `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` of a
      dead humanoid to a positive nonzero value.

    description: |
      This property controls when a humanoid's health bar is allowed to be
      displayed. By default, this property is set to
      `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|DisplayWhenDamaged`, which makes the
      health bar only display when a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health`
      is less than its `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth`. It can also be set
      to `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|AlwaysOn`, which makes the health bar
      always display, or `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|AlwaysOff`, which
      prevents it from ever displaying.

      Note that this property functions independently of the humanoid's
      `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance` property
      which is responsible for making the health bar fade out at certain
      distances. If `Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType` is set to

      Although setting this property to 0 will effectively prevent the humanoid

      Determines how much upwards force is applied to the `Class.Humanoid` when
      jumping. The starting value of this property is determined by the value of
      `Class.StarterPlayer.CharacterJumpPower` which defaults to 50 and is
      constrained between 0 and 1000. Note that jumps are also influenced by the
      `Class.Workspace.Gravity` property which determines the acceleration due
      to gravity.

      Although setting this property to 0 will effectively prevent the humanoid
      from jumping, it's recommended to disable jumping by disabling the
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Jumping` state through
      `Class.Humanoid:SetStateEnabled()`.

      This property is only visible in the
      [Properties](../../../studio/properties.md) window if
      `Class.Humanoid.UseJumpPower` is set to **true**, as it is not relevant
      otherwise (instead, `Class.Humanoid.JumpHeight` is used).

      This property describes how quickly the `Class.Humanoid` is able to walk,
      in studs per second. It defaults to the value of
      `Class.StarterPlayer.CharacterWalkSpeed` (`16`), meaning a player
      character can move 16 studs in any direction each second.

      #### Notes

      - When controlled on a mobile device or a gamepad, a humanoid can walk
        slower than its `Class.Humanoid.WalkSpeed|WalkSpeed` if the controlling
        thumbstick is moved just a gradual degree from center.
      - You can freeze a humanoid in place by setting
        `Class.Humanoid.WalkSpeed|WalkSpeed` to `0`, effectively preventing the
        controlling player from moving it through the default movement
        mechanisms. Note, however, that `Class.Humanoid.WalkSpeed|WalkSpeed` is
        a client‑replicated property which can be modified locally, so it should
        **not** be used as a security mechanism or as the sole method for
        preventing humanoid movement.
      - The default animation script scales a humanoid's movement animations
        based on how fast it is moving relative to the default speed of 16
        studs/second.
      - The speed at which the `Class.Humanoid` is currently walking can be
        obtained using the `Class.Humanoid.Running|Running` event.

      When `WalkToPart` is set and a humanoid is actively trying to reach the

      described in Luau as:

      ```lua
      goal = humanoid.WalkToPart.CFrame:PointToObjectSpace(humanoid.WalkToPoint)
      ```

      Note that simply setting the value of `WalkToPart` is not sufficient to

      This method attaches the specified `Class.Accessory` to the humanoid's

      When this method is called, an `Class.Accessory` is attached to the
      character by searching for an `Class.Attachment` in the humanoid's parent
      that shares the same name as an `Class.Attachment` in the accessory's
      **Handle** `Class.Part`. If one is found, the **Handle** part will be
      connected to the parent of the `Class.Attachment` using a `Class.Weld`,
      and the weld will be configured so the `Class.Attachment|Attachments`
      occupy the same space.

      If the required `Class.Attachment` can not be found, then the
      `Class.Accessory` will remain parented to the humanoid's parent but it
      will be unattached.

      Typically, accessory welds are created on the server, but they can be

    description: |
      This yielding method makes the character's look match that of the passed
      in `Class.HumanoidDescription`. A copy of the passed
      `Class.HumanoidDescription` is cached as the `Class.HumanoidDescription`
      for the `Class.Humanoid`.

      This method is optimized through making the assumption that only this
      method is used to change the appearance of the character, and no changes
      are made through other means between calls. If changes are made to the
      character between calls, then this method may not make the character
      reflect the passed in `Class.HumanoidDescription` accurately. If you want
      to use this method in conjunction with other means of updating the
      character, `Class.Humanoid:ApplyDescriptionResetAsync()` will always
      ensure the character reflects the passed in `Class.HumanoidDescription`.

      Starting from the humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.RootPart|RootPart`, this

    description: |
      This method causes the `Class.Humanoid` to enter the given
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType`, describing the activity the `Class.Humanoid` is
      currently doing.

      Please review the `Enum.HumanoidStateType` page for more information on
      the particular states, as some have unintuitive names. For example,
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Running` describes a state where the humanoid's
      legs are on the ground, including when stationary.

      Due to the default behavior of the `Class.Humanoid`, some states will
      automatically be changed when set. For example:

      - Setting the state to `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Swimming` when the humanoid
        is not in the water will cause it to be automatically set to
        `Enum.HumanoidStateType.GettingUp`.
      - As it is unused, setting the state to
        `Enum.HumanoidStateType.PlatformStanding` will cause the humanoid state
        to be automatically set to `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Running`.

      Note that in order to set the `Class.Humanoid` state using this method,
      you must do so from a `Class.LocalScript` and the client must have
      [network ownership](../../../physics/network-ownership.md) of the
      `Class.Player.Character`. Alternatively, you can call this method from a
      server-side `Class.Script`, but the server must have network ownership of
      the player character.

      See also `Class.Humanoid:SetStateEnabled()` to enable or disable a
      particular state, and `Class.Humanoid:GetState()` to get the current
      humanoid state.

      This method returns what `Enum.BodyPartR15` a `Class.Part` is, or
      `Enum.BodyPartR15.Unknown` if the part is not an R15 body part. This
      method allows developers to retrieve player body parts independent of what
      the actual body part names are, instead returning an enum.

      It can be used in conjunction with `Class.Humanoid:ReplaceBodyPartR15()`.
      For example, if a player's body part touches something, this function will
      return get a part instance. Developers can then look up what part of the
      body that was, like head or arm. Then depending on what that part was,
      developers can either perform some gameplay action or replace that part
      with some other part - perhaps showing damage.

      This method can be useful for games where hit location is important. For
      example, it can be used to determine if a player is hit in the leg and
      then slow them down based on the injury.

      Causes the `Class.Humanoid` to walk in the given direction.
    description: |
      This method causes the `Class.Humanoid` to walk in the given
      `Datatype.Vector3` direction.

      By default, the direction is in world terms, but if the `relativeToCamera`
      parameter is `true`, the direction is relative to the `Datatype.CFrame` of
      the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera`. As the negative **Z**
      direction is considered "forwards" in Roblox, the following code will make
      the humanoid walk in the direction of the
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera`.

      ```lua
      humanoid:Move(Vector3.new(0, 0, -1), true)
      ```

      When this method is called, the `Class.Humanoid` will move until the
      method is called again. However, this method will be overwritten in the
      next frame by Roblox's default character control script. This can be
      avoided by either calling this function every frame using
      `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` (see example), or overwriting the
      control scripts in `Class.StarterPlayerScripts`.

      This method can be called on the server, but this should only be done when
      the server has [network ownership](../../../physics/network-ownership.md)
      of the humanoid's assembly.

      See also `Class.Humanoid:MoveTo()` which makes a`Class.Humanoid` walk to a
      point, and `Class.Player:Move()` which effectively calls this function.

      Causes the `Class.Humanoid` to attempt to walk to the given location by

    description: |
      This method causes the `Class.Humanoid` to attempt to walk to a given
      location by setting the `Class.Humanoid.WalkToPoint|WalkToPoint` and
      `Class.Humanoid.WalkToPart|WalkToPart` properties, corresponding to the
      `location` and `part` parameters.

      If the `part` parameter is specified, the `Class.Humanoid` will still
      attempt to walk to the `location` parameter's point. However, if the
      `part` moves, the point will move to be at the same position **relative to
      the part**.

      Note that the movement operation will time out after 8 seconds if the
      humanoid doesn't reach its goal (this timeout exists so that humanoids do
      not get stuck waiting for `Class.Humanoid.MoveToFinished|MoveToFinished`
      to fire). If you don't want this to happen, call `MoveTo()` at a repeated
      interval so that the timeout keeps resetting.

      `Class.Humanoid:MoveTo()|MoveTo()` ends if any of the following conditions
      apply:

      - The character arrives at its destination, assuming a ~1 stud threshold
        to account for various humanoid speeds and framerates.

      - The character gets stuck and the timer expires.

      - The value of either `Class.Humanoid.WalkToPoint|WalkToPoint` or
        `Class.Humanoid.WalkToPart|WalkToPart` changes.

      - A script calls `Class.Humanoid:Move()|Move()` with a new `moveDirection`
        parameter.

      - A script changes the `Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame` property of the
        humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.RootPart|RootPart`.

    description: |
      This method lowers the `Class.Humanoid.Health` of the `Class.Humanoid` by
      the given _amount_ if it is not protected by a `Class.ForceField`

      This method accepts negative values for the _amount_ parameter. This will
      increase the humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.Health`. However this will only
      have an effect if no `Class.ForceField` is present.

      #### How do ForceFields protect against TakeDamage

      A `Class.Humanoid` is considered protected by a `Class.ForceField` if a
      `Class.ForceField` meets one of the following criteria:

      - The `Class.ForceField` shares the same `Class.Instance.Parent` as the
        `Class.Humanoid`
      - The `Class.ForceField` is parented to the `Class.Humanoid.RootPart` of
        the `Class.Humanoid`
      - The `Class.ForceField` is parented to an ancestor of the
        `Class.Humanoid` other than the `Class.Workspace`

      To do damage to a `Class.Humanoid` irrespective of any
      `Class.ForceField|ForceFields` present, set `Class.Humanoid.Health`
      directly.

      For more information on how `Class.ForceField|ForceFields` protect
      `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` see the `Class.ForceField` page.

    description: |
      This event fires when the `Class.Humanoid` dies, usually when
      `Class.Humanoid.Health` reaches 0. This could be caused either by
      disconnecting their head from their `Class.Humanoid.Torso`, or directly
      setting the health property.

      This event only fires if the `Class.Humanoid` is a descendant of the
      `Class.Workspace`. If the `Dead` `Enum.HumanoidStateType` is disabled it
      will not fire.

      The FallingDown event fires when the `Class.Humanoid` enters and leaves
      the `FallingDown` `Enum.HumanoidStateType`.

      The `Class.Humanoid` will enter the `GettingUp` state 3 seconds after the
      `FallingDown` state is enabled. When this happens this event will fire
      with an _active_ value of _false_, and `Class.Humanoid.GettingUp` will
      fire with an _active_ value of _true_.

      The _active_ parameter represents whether the `Class.Humanoid` is entering
      or leaving the `Freefall` state.

      Although the `Freefall` state generally ends when the `Class.Humanoid`
      reaches the ground, this event may fire with _active_ equal to _false_ if
      the state is changed while the `Class.Humanoid` is falling. For this
      reason, you should use `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged` and listen for the
      `Landed` state to work out when a `Class.Humanoid` has landed.

      This event fires when the `Class.Humanoid` enters or leaves the
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType.GettingUp` state, a transition state that is
      activated shortly after the `Class.Humanoid` enters the
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType.FallingDown|FallingDown` (3 seconds) or
      `Enum.HumanoidStateType.Ragdoll|Ragdoll` (1 second) states.

      When a `Class.Humanoid` attempts to get back up, this event will first
      fire with an `active` parameter of `true` before shortly after firing
      again with an `active` parameter of `false`.

      To force a `Class.Humanoid` to fall over, use the

    description: |
      This event fires when one of the humanoid's limbs comes in contact with
      another `Class.BasePart`. The `Class.BasePart` which the limb is touching,
      along with the limb itself, is given.

      This event will not fire when limbs belonging to the `Class.Humanoid` come
      into contact with themselves.

      #### Alternatives

      Although the `Class.Humanoid.Touched` event is useful, you should consider
      if there are alternatives that better suit your needs.

      - In most cases, it's advised to connect a `Class.BasePart.Touched` event
        for `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` of interest instead, as the
        `Class.Humanoid.Touched` event will constantly fire when the humanoid is
        moving. For example, in a dodgeball game, it would be more practical to
        connect a `Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched` event for the balls rather
        than use `Class.Humanoid.Touched`.
      - When trying to work out when the `Class.Humanoid` has landed on the
        ground, the `Class.Humanoid.StateChanged` event is more suitable.
        Alternatively, you can check `Class.Humanoid.FloorMaterial` to see if
        the humanoid is standing on any non-air material.

      #### Notes

      - Connecting to this event will cause a `Class.TouchTransmitter` to be
        created in every limb.
      - There is currently no equivalent of `Class.BasePart.TouchEnded` for
        `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids`.
