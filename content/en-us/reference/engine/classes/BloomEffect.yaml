name: BloomEffect
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Simulates the camera viewing a very bright light.
description: |
  The **BloomEffect** simulates the camera viewing a very bright light. It
  causes brighter colors to glow, similar to applying the neon
  `Class.BasePart.Material|Material` to everything, including the `Class.Sky`.
  Multiple **BloomEffect** objects can be applied at once and they will compose
  their effects together.

  Like other post-processing effects, **BloomEffect** will only work while
  `Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled` and when parented to `Class.Lighting` or
  `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. Also, it may render differently depending on
  your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level** settings in **Rendering**
  &rarr; **Performance**).

  For more details on this effect and others, see
  [Post-Processing Effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md).

      Determines the additive blending intensity.
    description: |
      Intensity determines how intensely the colors that bloom (determined by
      the `Class.BloomEffect.Threshold|Threshold`) will additively blend with
      themselves. Higher values will produce brighter colors.

    description: |
      Size determines the radius of the bloom effect in pixels in a similar
      manner to `Class.BlurEffect.Size`. Larger values create a wider bloom
      effect, and a value of 0 will disable the bleed (but not the color
      adjustment).

      Threshold determines how bright a color can be before it blooms. If set to
      1, only pure white colors will bloom. If set to 0, all colors will bloom.
