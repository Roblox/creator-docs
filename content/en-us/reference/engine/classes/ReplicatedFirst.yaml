  A container whose contents are replicated to all clients (but not back to the
  server) first before anything else.
description: |
  `ReplicatedFirst` is a container whose contents are replicated to all clients
  (but not back to the server) before anything else. It's most commonly used to
  store `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` and other elements that are essential
  for the experience's start such as
  [loading screens](../../../players/loading-screens.md).

  For objects that do **not** need to be replicated before anything else, use
  the `Class.ReplicatedStorage` container instead.

  There are some key considerations for running `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`
  in `ReplicatedFirst`:

  - Since its contents replicate before anything else in the experience,
    `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` running in `ReplicatedFirst` will need to
    wait for any objects they require to replicate using
    `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()`
  - Any objects that are to be used by a `Class.LocalScript` in
    `ReplicatedFirst` should also be parented to `ReplicatedFirst`. Otherwise,
    they may replicate to the client late, yielding the script and negating the
    benefit of initial replication.

      Immediately removes the default Roblox loading screen.
    description: |
      Immediately removes the default Roblox loading screen. Note that if any
      object has been placed in `ReplicatedFirst`, the default loading screen
      will be removed after a few seconds regardless if this method has been
      called or not.

      You should **not** remove the default loading screen unless you want to
      display your own. If you remove the default screen without a replacement,
      players will be able to see geometry loading in the background.
