  ## What is ReplicatedFirst for?

  ReplicatedFirst is most commonly used to store
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` and other objects that are essential for the
  game's start. As the contents of ReplicatedFirst replicate to the client
  before anything else in the game, it is ideal for creating loading GUIs or
  tutorials.

  For objects that do not need to be replicated first, use the
  `Class.ReplicatedStorage` container instead.

  ## How can I use ReplicatedFirst?

  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` placed within ReplicatedFirst will run. This
  means code for custom loading screens or other ReplicatedFirst uses can be ran
  at the earliest possible point.

  There are a number of key considerations to remember when running
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` in ReplicatedFirst.

  - Its contents replicate before anything else in the game, meaning
    `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` running in ReplicatedFirst will need to
    wait for any objects they require to replicate using
    `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()`
  - Any objects that are to be used by a `Class.LocalScript` in ReplicatedFirst
    should also be parented to ReplicatedFirst. Otherwise, they may replicate to
    the client late, yielding the script and negating the benefit of
    ReplicatedFirst.

  ReplicatedFirst also includes the function
  `Class.ReplicatedFirst:RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen()`, which can be used to
  immediately remove the default Roblox loading screen. Note if any object has
  been placed in ReplicatedFirst, the default loading screen will remove after 5
  seconds regardless if this function has been called or not.

      has been placed in `Class.ReplicatedFirst`, the default loading screen
      will remove after 5 seconds regardless if this function has been called or
      not.

      Run this function from a `Class.LocalScript` in `Class.ReplicatedFirst`,
      as scripts in `Class.ReplicatedFirst` will execute before anything else.

      Don't remove the default loading screen unless you want to display your
      own. If you remove the default screen without a replacement, users will be
      able to see geometry loading in the background.
