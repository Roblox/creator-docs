name: BodyGyro
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a torque to maintain a constant orientation.
description: |
  The `BodyGyro` object applies a torque (rotational force) on an assembly such
  that it maintains a constant angular displacement, or orientation. This allows
  for the creation of assemblies that point in a certain direction, as if a real
  gyroscope were acting upon it. Essentially, it's the rotational counterpart to
  a `Class.BodyPosition`.

  If you would like to maintain a constant angular velocity, use a
  `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` instead.

  The `Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame` property controls the goal orientation.
  Only the angular components of the `Datatype.CFrame` are used; position will
  make no difference. `Class.BodyGyro.MaxTorque|MaxTorque` limits the amount of
  angular force that may be applied, `Class.BodyGyro.P|P` controls the power
  used in achieving the goal orientation, and `Class.BodyGyro.D|D` controls
  dampening behavior.

      Determines the target orientation (translational component ignored).
    description: |
      This property (not to be confused with `Class.BasePart.CFrame`) determines
      the target orientation towards which torque will be exerted. Since
      `Class.BodyGyro` does not apply translational force, the
      translational/positional component of the `Datatype.CFrame` is ignored.
      Consider using one of the following CFrame constructors in setting this
      property: `Datatype.CFrame.fromAxisAngle()`,
      `Datatype.CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ()`, or
      `Datatype.CFrame.fromEulerAnglesYXZ()`.

    summary: |
      Determines the amount of dampening to use in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame`.
    description: |
      This property defines how much dampening will be applied to the torque
      used to reach the goal `Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame`. When the assembly
      approaches the goal orientation, it needs to decelerate, otherwise it will
      rotate past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate back toward the
      goal. This often creates an undesirable "rubber‑banding" effect, avoided
      by applying dampening. The higher this value is set, the greater the
      dampening curve becomes, or the slower the assembly will approach the goal
      orientation.

    description: |
      This property determines the limit on the amount of torque that may be
      applied on each axis in reaching the goal orientation
      (`Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame`). If an assembly isn't moving, consider
      increasing this value and also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored assemblies.

      This property determines how much power is used while applying torque in
      order to reach the goal `Class.BodyGyro.CFrame|CFrame`. The higher this
      value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
