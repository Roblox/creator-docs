  Lays out sibling UI elements and their child UI elements as rows/columns and
  cells in a table.
description: |
  A UITableLayout lays out sibling UI elements as rows in a table. Child UI
  elements (the table cells) of these rows are then arranged in columns (within
  rows). Each cell within a row has the same height, and each cell within a
  column has the same width. The hierarchy in the explorer should look like this
  (`Class.Frame|Frames` are yellow rows; `Class.TextLabel|TextLabels` are
  cells).

  <img src="../../../assets/legacy/UITableLayout_Padding.png" alt="UITableLayout result" />

  By changing the `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection`, sibling UI elements
  can act as columns instead.

  When applied, a UITableLayout will take control of sibling and cell elements'
  `Class.GuiObject.Size` and `Class.GuiObject.Position`. Changing these in the
  Properties window is still possible will not produce any effect.

  Dimensions of the cells in the resulting table are controlled by the parent UI
  element's dimensions. Unless `Class.UITableLayout.FillEmptySpaceColumns` or
  `Class.UITableLayout.FillEmptySpaceRows` is enabled, the cell dimensions will
  be that of the parent UI element (and thus tables with more than one cell
  extend outside of their parent).

  Cells will continue to respect `Class.UISizeConstraint` objects within them.
  In other words, setting `Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize` on
  `Class.UISizeConstraint|UISizeConstraints` within the header cells can
  determine the size of the rest of the cells. If
  `Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize` restricts a cell's size from filling the
  allotted space (i.e. another row/column is wider than it), it will align to
  the top-left.

    summary: |
      Determines whether cells are sized such that they occupy the horizontal
      space of the parent UI element.
    description: |
      FillEmptySpaceColumns determines whether cells' X size are set such that
      the entire horizontal space of the parent UI element is used. Enabling
      this is useful for making sure your table takes up a more easily
      predictable amount of horizontal space (the X-axis size of the parent UI
      element). It is still possible that a `Class.UISizeConstraint` applied to
      cells will cause underflow/overflow.

      When enabling this property, the column widths will be approximately equal
      to the parent's `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize`.X component divided by the
      number of columns (not accounting for padding or other factors).

      FillEmptySpaceRows determines whether cells' Y size are set such that the

      MajorAxis determines whether sibling UI elements are treated as rows or
      columns. Below, the left uses a `Enum.TableMajorAxis` of RowMajor, and the
      right uses ColumnMajor.

    summary: |
      Determines the empty space between cells.
    description: |
      Padding will position elements with extra space between them. This can be
      done using Scale or Offset components of UDim2. Negative values can bring
      elements closer together. When non-zero, the sibling UI elements may be
      visible between the cells contained within them. In the image below, you
      can see the padding of 5 pixels applied between the cells (and the sibling
      UI elements acting as rows in yellow).
