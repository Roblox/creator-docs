description: |
  An object used to hold two objects together in a relative position, regardless
  of whether they're touching. This object is placed inside of a
  `Class.BasePart` and the `Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1` property determines
  which other part should be welded to the original part. Two
  `Datatype.CFrame|CFrames`, `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0` and
  `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1`, then determine how the parts should be placed.

  See also `Class.RigidConstraint` for a newer alternative using the constraints
  system that does not require `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0` or
  `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1`, but instead uses `Class.Attachment` to control
  offsets, through `Class.Constraint.Attachment0` and
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1`.

  While the weld is `Class.JointInstance.Active|Active`, it maintains the part
  positions such that: `part1.CFrame * C1 == Part0.CFrame * C0`

  ## Root part

  Every Assembly has a root part, see `Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()`. When a
  Weld's `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0`/`Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` is modified the
  root part will stay where it was.

  ## Directionality

  Welds do not have any directionality. `Class.JointInstance.Part0|Part0` or
  `Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1`, doesn't matter. You can imagine rigid
  joints forming a tree branching down from the root part. All the parts down
  the tree from root will move, and their welded "children" in this tree will
  move with them.
