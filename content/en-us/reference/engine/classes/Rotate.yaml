description: |
  The **Rotate** object is used to allow rotation between two parts. Most
  commonly created through the `Enum.SurfaceType.Hinge` on a `Class.BasePart`.
  If created like this, the rotation will be about the normal vector from the
  face of the part the hinge is placed on. If created through a script, the axis
  and point of rotation can be defined arbitrarily.

deprecation_message: |
  This class works alongside the deprecated `Enum.SurfaceType` and should not be
  used for future work; use `Class.HingeConstraint` instead.
