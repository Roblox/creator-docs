description: |
  The Rotate object is used to allow rotation between two parts. Most commonly
  created through the Hinge SurfaceType on a `Class.BasePart`. If created like
  this, the rotation will be about the normal vector from the face of the part
  the hinge is placed on. If created through a script the axis and point of
  rotation can be defined arbitrarily.
