name: Rotate
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: ''
description: |
  The **Rotate** object is used to allow rotation between two parts. Most
  commonly created through the `Enum.SurfaceType.Hinge` on a `Class.BasePart`.
  If created like this, the rotation will be about the normal vector from the
  face of the part the hinge is placed on. If created through a script, the axis
  and point of rotation can be defined arbitrarily.
