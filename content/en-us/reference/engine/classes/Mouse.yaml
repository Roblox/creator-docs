  Legacy object that contains members useful for pointer input.
description: |
  **Mouse** has been superseded by `Class.UserInputService` and
  `Class.ContextActionService`, which cover a broader scope, are more feature
  rich, and support **cross-platform** patterns better. It remains supported
  because of its widespread use, but you should strongly consider using these
  alternatives.

  The **Mouse** object houses various API for pointers, primarily for buttons
  and raycasting. It can be accessed through `Class.Player:GetMouse()` called on
  the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer` in a `Class.LocalScript`. It is also passed by
  the `Class.Tool.Equipped` event.

  - It is most notable for the `Class.Mouse.Icon|Icon` property, which changes
    the cursor's appearance.
  - It continually raycasts the screen mouse position into the 3D world using
    the `Class.Mouse.TargetFilter|TargetFilter` property, storing the results of
    the raycast in the `Class.Mouse.Hit|Hit`, `Class.Mouse.Target|Target`, and
    `Class.Mouse.TargetSurface|TargetSurface` properties. These can be useful
    for simple cases, but `Class.WorldRoot:Raycast()` should be used in more
    complicated [raycasting](../../../workspace/raycasting.md) scenarios.
  - `Class.Plugin|Plugins` can use `Class.Plugin:GetMouse()` to get a
    `Class.PluginMouse`, which behaves similarly.

  ```lua
  -- From a LocalScript:
  local Players = game:GetService("Players")
  local player = Players.LocalPlayer
  local mouse = player:GetMouse()
  -- Setting the mouse icon
  mouse.Icon = "rbxasset://SystemCursors/Wait"
  ```

  Note:

  - This object does not control/restrict pointer movement. For this, see
    `Class.UserInputService.MouseBehavior` and
    `Class.UserInputService.MouseDeltaSensitivity`.
  - If two functions are connected to same input event, such as
    `Class.Mouse.Button1Down|Button1Down`, **both** functions will run when the
    event fires. There is no concept of sinking/passing input, as events don't
    support this behavior. However, `Class.ContextActionService` does have this
    behavior through `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction`.
  - While a mouse may not be available on all platforms, Mouse will still
    function on mobile (touch) and console (gamepad), which don't typically have
    mice or pointer hardware. For explicit cross-platform behaviors, use
    `Class.UserInputService` and `Class.ContextActionService`.

    See [Input and Camera](../../../input/index.md) for more information on
    customizing inputs in your experience.

    summary: |
      The `Datatype.CFrame` of the mouse's position in 3D space.
    description: |
      This property indicates `Datatype.CFrame` of the mouse's position in 3D
      space. Note that `Class.Mouse.TargetFilter` and its descendants will be
      ignored.

      Developers can get obtain the position of Hit like so:

      ```
      local position = mouse.Hit.p
      ```

      Hit is often used by `Class.Tool|Tools` to fire a weapon towards the mouse
      in third person.

      Developers looking for the `Class.BasePart` the mouse is pointing at
      should use `Class.Mouse.Target`.

      #### How is Mouse.Hit calculated?

      The position of the Hit CFrame is calculated as the point of intersection
      between the mouse's internal `Datatype.Ray` (an extended version of
      `Class.Mouse.UnitRay`) and an object in 3D space (such as a part).

      The orientation of the Hit CFrame corresponds with the direction of the
      `Class.Mouse.UnitRay`.

      ```
      local unitRayDirection = mouse.UnitRay.Direction
      local mouseHitDirection = mouse.Hit.lookVector
      -- unitRayDirection ≈ mouseHitDirection
      -- the vectors are approximately equal
      ```

      Note, the roll of the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` is not used when
      calculating the orientation of the Hit `Datatype.CFrame`.

      The mouse's internal ray extends for 1000 studs. If the mouse is not
      pointing at an object in 3D space (for example when pointing at the sky),
      this property will be 1000 studs away from the
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.

    summary: |
      The content ID of the image used as the `Class.Mouse` icon.
    description: |
      **Icon** is a property that determines the image used as the pointer. If
      blank, a default arrow is used. While the cursor hovers over a
      `Class.GuiButton`, this property is temporarily ignored.

      To hide the cursor entirely, **do not** use a transparent image &ndash;
      instead, set `Class.UserInputService.MouseIconEnabled` to false.

      For getting/setting the user mouse icon in experiences, you should use
      `Class.UserInputService.MouseIcon`. `Class.Mouse.Icon` will be deprecated
      after the new API for plugins to set the mouse cursor is released.

      #### Designing a Cursor

      The following guidelines may prove useful when creating your own mouse
      cursors:

      - The dimensions of the image used determines the size of the cursor.
      - The **center** of the image is where mouse inputs are issued.
      - The default mouse image is 64x64 pixels, with the mouse taking up 17x24
        pixels of space.

      #### System Cursors for `Class.PluginMouse`

      When using a `Class.PluginMouse` retrieved from `Class.Plugin:GetMouse()`,
      you can use the following icons similar to your system's default cursors,
      such as hands, arrows, I-beams, etc. You can use these with GUI events
      like `Class.GuiObject.MouseEnter|MouseEnter`,
      `Class.GuiObject.MouseLeave|MouseLeave`, and
      `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton1Down|MouseButton1Down` to provide a
      consistent studio experience when interacting with certain kinds of GUI
      components. Note that these only work for studio plugins; they will not
      work for other `Class.Mouse` objects.

      Fired when the left mouse button is pressed.
    description: |
      The Button1Down even fires when the player presses their left mouse
      button.

      This can also be accessed from a `Class.Tool`. For example, when placed in
      a `Class.LocalScript`, the code below prints Button1Down whenever the left
      mouse button is pressed:

      ```lua
      local Tool = script.Parent --make sure this is a Tool object

      Tool.Equipped:Connect(function(Mouse)
      	Mouse.Button1Down:Connect(function()
      		print("Button1Down")
      	end)
      end)
      ```

      Developers can find out the position of the mouse in world-space, and if
      it is pointing at any `Class.BasePart`, using the `Class.Mouse.Hit` and
      `Class.Mouse.Target` properties.

      For information on how to obtain the mouse object, please see the
      `Class.Mouse` page.

      Note, developers are recommended to use `Class.UserInputService` instead
      of the `Class.Mouse` object in new work.
