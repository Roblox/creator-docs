  `Class.EditableImage` allows for the runtime creation and manipulation of
  images.

  To create a blank `Class.EditableImage`, use `Datatype.Instance.new()`. To
  create an `Class.EditableImage` from an existing image, use
  `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync()`.

  `Class.EditableImage` overrides the image or texture displayed when parented
  to certain objects:

  <table size="small">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Object</th>
      <th>Overridden</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.MeshPart</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.MeshPart.TextureID</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.ImageLabel</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.ImageLabel.Image</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.ImageButton</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.ImageButton.Image</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.Decal</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.Decal.Texture</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.Texture</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.Texture.Texture</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.SurfaceAppearance</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.SurfaceAppearance.ColorMap</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  The `Class.EditableImage` coordinate system is relative to the top left of the
  image:

  - Top-left: `(0, 0)`
  - Bottom-right: `(Size.X - 1, Size.Y - 1)`

  When you use `Class.AssetService:PromptCreateAssetAsync()` to publish an
  object that has a property overridden by a child `Class.EditableImage`, the
  editable image is published as an image and the overridden property is set to
  a new asset ID.

properties:
  - name: EditableImage.Size
    summary: |
      Size of the `Class.EditableImage` in pixels.
    description: |
      Size of the `Class.EditableImage` in pixels. The maximum size is
      1024&times;1024. Attempting to set this property to a larger size will
      cause it to be clamped at 1024.

      Setting this property changes the **canvas** size of the editable image
      but does not resize the contents. If changing to a larger size, new pixels
      will be set to an RGBA value of `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. If changing to a smaller
      size, existing pixels will be cropped. Consider using
      `Class.EditableImage:Resize()|Resize()` to update the contents while
      changing the size.
