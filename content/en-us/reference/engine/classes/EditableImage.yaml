  `EditableImage` allows for the runtime creation and manipulation of images.

  To create a blank `EditableImage`, use
  `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImage()`. To create an `EditableImage` from
  an existing image, use `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync()`.

  `EditableImage` can be used in any `Datatype.Content` property which takes an
  image, such as `Class.ImageLabel.ImageContent` or
  `Class.MeshPart.TextureContent`. This is done by setting the content property
  to `Datatype.Content.fromObject(editableImage)`.

  The `EditableImage` coordinate system is relative to the top left of the
  image:

  - Top-left: `(0, 0)`
  - Bottom-right: `(Size.X - 1, Size.Y - 1)`

  When you use `Class.AssetService:PromptCreateAssetAsync()` to publish an
  object that has a `Datatype.Content` property which references an
  `EditableImage`, the editable image is published as an image and the property
  is set to a new asset ID.

  #### Update Limitations

  Only a single `EditableImage` can be updated per frame on the display side.
  For example, if you update three `EditableImage` objects which are currently
  being displayed, it will take three frames for all of them to be updated.

  #### Enabling for Published Experiences

  For security purposes, using `EditableImage` fails by default for published
  experiences. To enable usage, you must be 13+ age verified and ID verified.
  After you are verified, open Studio's
  [Experience Settings](../../../studio/experience-settings.md), select
  **Security**, and enable the **Allow Mesh&nbsp;&#47; Image APIs** toggle.

  #### Permissions

  To prevent misuse, `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync()` only allows
  you to load and edit image assets:

  - That are owned by the creator of the experience (if the experience is owned
    by an individual).
  - That are owned by a group (if the experience is owned by the group).
  - That are owned by the logged in Studio user (if the place file has not yet
    been saved or published to Roblox).

  The APIs throw an error if they are used to load an asset that does not meet
  the criteria above.

  #### Memory Limits

  Editable assets are currently expensive for memory usage. To minimize its
  impact on client performance, `EditableImage` has strict client-side memory
  budgets, although the server, Studio, and plugins operate with unlimited
  memory. Linking one `Class.EditableImage` to multiple image-related
  `Datatype.Content` data types (multi-referencing) can help with memory
  optimization.

            degrees and an angle of 90 means no fading but instead a hard edge
