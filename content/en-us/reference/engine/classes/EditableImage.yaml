description: |
  `Class.EditableImage` allows for the runtime creation and manipulation of
  images. It can be created from an existing image using
  `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableImageAsync()`, or a blank
  `Class.EditableImage` can be created with `Datatype.Instance.new()`.
  `Class.EditableImage` overrides the image/texture displayed when parented to
  certain objects as follows:

  <table size="small">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Object</th>
      <th>Overridden</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.MeshPart</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.MeshPart.TextureID</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.ImageLabel</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.ImageLabel.Image</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.ImageButton</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.ImageButton.Image</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>Class.Decal</code></td>
      <td><code>Class.Decal.Texture</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  The `Class.EditableImage` coordinate system is relative to the top left of the
  image:

  - Top-left: `(0, 0)`
  - Bottom-right: `(Size.X - 1, Size.Y - 1)`

  When publishing an object via `Class.AssetService:PromptCreateAssetAsync()`
  that has a property overridden by a child `Class.EditableImage`, the editable
  image will be published as an image and the overridden property will be set to
  the new asset ID.

properties:
  - name: EditableImage.Size
    summary: |
      Size of the `Class.EditableImage` in pixels.
    description: |
      Size of the `Class.EditableImage` in pixels. The maximum size is
      1024&times;1024 and attempting to set this property to a larger size will
      cause it to be clamped at 1024.

      Setting this property changes the **canvas** size of the editable image
      but does not resize the contents. If changing to a larger size, new pixels
      will be set to an RGBA value of `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. If changing to a smaller
      size, existing pixels will be cropped. Consider using
      `Class.EditableImage:Resize()|Resize()` to update the contents while
      changing the size.
