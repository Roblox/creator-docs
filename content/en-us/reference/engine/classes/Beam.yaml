description: |
  A **Beam** object connects two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` by drawing a
  texture between them.

  To display, a beam must be a descendant of the `Class.Workspace` with its
  `Class.Beam.Attachment0|Attachment0` and `Class.Beam.Attachment1|Attachment1`
  properties set to `Class.Attachment|Attachments` also descending from the
  `Class.Workspace`.

  The beam's appearance can be customized using the range of properties outlined
  below. Also see the [Beams](../../../effects/beams.md) guide for visual
  examples.

  #### Beam Curvature

  Beams are configured to use a cubic Bézier curve formed by four control
  points. This means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve
  of the beam can be modified by changing `Class.Beam.CurveSize0|CurveSize0`,
  `Class.Beam.CurveSize1|CurveSize1`, and the orientation of the beam's
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`.

  - **P0**: The start of the beam; position of `Class.Beam.Attachment0`.
  - **P1**: `Class.Beam.CurveSize0` studs away from `Class.Beam.Attachment0`, in
    `Class.Beam.Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
  - **P2**: `Class.Beam.CurveSize1` studs away from `Class.Beam.Attachment1`, in
    `Class.Beam.Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
  - **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Class.Beam.Attachment1`

      Determines the color of the `Class.Beam`.

      If the `Class.Beam`'s `Class.Beam.Texture` is set, this color will be
      applied to the `Class.Beam`'s texture. If no `Class.Beam.Texture` has been
      set then the `Class.Beam` will appear as a solid bar colored in accordance
      with this property.

      #### Beams and ColorSequences

      This property is a `Datatype.ColorSequence`, allowing the color to be
      configured to vary across the length of the `Class.Beam`. Take for example
      the following `Datatype.ColorSequence`.

      ```lua
      local colorSequence = ColorSequence.new({
      	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)), -- red
      	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)), -- green
      	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)), -- blue
      	}
      )
      ```

      Applying this `Datatype.ColorSequence` to a `Class.Beam` would yield the
      following result:

      ![enter image description here](/assets/legacy/BeamColor.png)

      Note the `Class.Beam`'s coloration also depends on the number of
      `Class.Beam.Segments` the `Class.Beam` has. Each segment of the beam can
      only show a transition between two colors. Therefore a `Class.Beam` will
      need to have at least n-1 segments in order for the color to display
      correctly, where n is the number of `Datatype.ColorSequenceKeypoint`s in
      the `Datatype.ColorSequence`

      local controlPoint1 = Beam.Attachment0.WorldPosition + (Beam.Attachment0.CFrame.rightVector * Beam.CurveSize0)
      ```

      #### Beam Curvature

      Beams are configured to use a cubic
      [Bézier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve). This
      means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve of the
      beam can be modified by changing CurveSize0, `Class.Beam.CurveSize1` and
      the orientation of the beam's `Class.Attachment`s.

      Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined
      as follows:

      - **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of `Class.Beam.Attachment0`
      - **P1**: CurveSize0 studs away from `Class.Beam.Attachment0`, in
        `Class.Beam.Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
      - **P2**: `Class.Beam.CurveSize1` studs away from
        `Class.Beam.Attachment1`, in `Class.Beam.Attachment1`'s negative X
        direction.
      - **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Class.Beam.Attachment1`

      The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the
      direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

      See the images below for a visual demonstration.

        `Class.Beam.Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
      - **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Class.Beam.Attachment1`

      A `Class.Beam` has no depth, and is hence a two dimensional projection
      existing in three dimensional space. This means that, by default, a
      `Class.Beam` is not visible from every angle.

      When FaceCamera is set to true, the `Class.Beam` will always be orientated
      towards the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.

      Determines to what degree the colors of the `Class.Beam` are blended with
      the colors behind it.

      The LightEmission property determines the blending of the `Class.Beam`
      with the colors behind it. It should be set in the range [0, 1]. A value
      of 0 uses normal blending modes, and a value of 1 will use additive
      blending. The value of the additive blending is determined by this
      property.

      Pictured below are two sets of overlapping `Class.Beam`s. The right one
      has its LightEmission set to 1, so the texture appears brighter due to the
      additive blending on the overlaps.

      ![](/assets/legacy/BeamLightEmission.png)

      This property should not be confused with `Class.Beam.LightInfluence`,
      which determines how particles are affected by environment light. This
      property does not cause the `Class.Beam` to light the environment. To do
      that, consider using a `Class.SurfaceLight`.

      LightInfluence is clamped between 0 and 1. When LightInfluence is 0, the
      `Class.Beam` will be unaffected by the environment's lighting. When
      LightInfluence is 1 however, it will be fully affected by lighting (as a
      `Class.BasePart` would be).

      This value can be any integer greater than 0. The default value is 10.

      #### Beam Segments and curvature

      Rather than being a perfect curve, a beam is made up of straight segments.
      The more segments, the higher the resolution of the curve. See the image
      below for a demonstration of this:

      ![Beam Segments](/assets/legacy/Beam.Segments.jpg)

      For more information on how a `Class.Beam` is configured to curve, see the
      page for `Class.Beam.CurveSize0`.

      #### Beam Segments with Color and Transparency

      The `Class.Beam.Color` and `Class.Beam.Transparency` properties require a
      certain number of segments to display correctly. This is because each
      segment can only show a transition between two colors or transparencies.
      Therefore a `Class.Beam` requires at least n-1 segments to display
      correctly, where n is the number of keypoint associated with the
      `Class.Beam`'s `Class.Beam.Color` and `Class.Beam.Transparency`.

      Determines the manner in which the `Class.Beam.Texture` scales and

      #### Beam Texture Behavior

      How a `Class.Beam`'s texture scales or repeats is dependent on the
      TextureMode property.

      When TextureMode is 'Wrap' the size of the repeating texture corresponds
      to `Class.Beam.TextureLength` in studs. For an example of this see the
      image below:

      <img src="/assets/legacy/textureMode_wrap.jpg" class = "half-sized" />

      Note, the 'Static' `Enum.TextureMode` type is not used for `Class.Beam`s
      and therefore behaves identically to 'Wrap'.

      When `Class.Beam.TextureMode` is set to 'Stretch' however the texture will
      be stretched relative to the beam's length. The size of the texture
      relative to the `Class.Beam`'s length will be one over the
      `Class.Beam.TextureLength`. In practice, this means the texture will
      repeat `Class.Beam.TextureLength` times. For an example of this see the
      image below:

      <img src="/assets/legacy/textureMode_strech.jpg" class = "half-sized" />

      When TextureSpeed is positive, the beam's texture will move from
      `Class.Beam.Attachment0` to `Class.Beam.Attachment1`. This direction can
      be inverted by setting TextureSpeed to a negative number.

      Note the speed at which the texture moves is relative to the length of the
      texture. Meaning the more stretched the beam's `Class.Beam.Texture` is,
      the faster it will move at the same TextureSpeed.

      #### Beams and Transparency

      This property is a `Datatype.NumberSequence`, allowing the transparency to
      be configured to vary across the length of the `Class.Beam`. Take for
      example the following `Datatype.NumberSequence`.

      ```lua
      local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new({
      	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 1), -- transparent
      	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 0), -- opaque
      	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 1), -- transparent
      	}
      )
      ```

      Applying this `Datatype.NumberSequence` to a `Class.Beam` would yield the
      following result:

      ![enter image description here](/assets/legacy/BeamTransparency.png)

      Note the `Class.Beam|Beam's` transparency also depends on the number of
      `Class.Beam.Segments` the `Class.Beam` has. Each segment of the beam can
      only show a transition between two transparencies. Therefore a
      `Class.Beam` will need to have at least n-1 segments in order to display
      correctly, where n is the number of `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint`s in
      the `Datatype.NumberSequence`

      The width in studs of the `Class.Beam` at its end.

      The beam will be `Class.Beam.Width0` studs wide at
      `Class.Beam.Attachment0` and the width will change linearly to Width1
      studs at `Class.Beam.Attachment1`.

      The distance, in studs, the `Class.Beam`s display is offset by relative to
      the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.

      When ZOffset is 0, the `Class.Beam` will be displayed in its standard
      position between `Class.Beam.Attachment0` and `Class.Beam.Attachment1`.
      ZOffset can be both positive and negative.

      This property can be particularly useful when using multiple
      `Class.Beam|Beams` between the same `Class.Attachment`s. It can be used to
      layer the `Class.Beam`s and avoid

      Sets the current offset of the `Class.Beam`'s texture cycle.

      Sets the current offset of the `Class.Beam`'s texture cycle.

      The offset of a `Class.Beam`s texture cycle represents the progress of the
      `Class.Beam`s texture animation. Hence, a `Class.Beam`'s texture cycle can
      be reset as follows:

      ```lua
      beam:SetTextureOffset(0)
      ```

      Where manual control is not required over the `Class.Beam`'s texture
      cycle, `Class.Beam.TextureSpeed` can be used instead to animate the
      `Class.Beam`. Although, for illustrative purposes, a similar function can
      be achieved with SetTextureOffset.

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
      while true do
      	for i = 1, 0, -0.01 do
      		RunService.RenderStepped:Wait()
      		beam:SetTextureOffset(i)
      	end
      end
      ```

      Note:

      - The given offset parameter is expected to be a value between 0 and 1,
        but greater values can still be used
      - The texture cycle wraps at 0 and 1, meaning the texture is in the same
        position when the offset is 0 or at 1
      - If the `Class.Beam.Texture` property is not set, this function will do
        nothing
      - Increasing the offset will act in the inverse direction to the
        `Class.Beam.TextureSpeed` property. Meaning, it will move the texture in
        the opposite direction to the direction the texture animates when
        `Class.Beam.TextureSpeed` is more than 0
