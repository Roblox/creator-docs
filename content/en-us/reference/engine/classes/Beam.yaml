  Connects two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` by drawing a texture between them.
description: |
  A **Beam** object connects two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` by drawing a
  texture between them.

  To display, a beam must be a descendant of the `Class.Workspace` with its
  `Class.Beam.Attachment0|Attachment0` and `Class.Beam.Attachment1|Attachment1`
  properties set to `Class.Attachment|Attachments` also descending from the
  `Class.Workspace`.

  The beam's appearance can be customized using the range of properties outlined
  below. Also see the [Beams](../../../effects/beams.md) guide for visual
  examples.

  #### Beam Curvature

  Beams are configured to use a cubic Bézier curve formed by four control
  points. This means they are not constrained to straight lines and the curve of
  the beam can be modified by changing `Class.Beam.CurveSize0|CurveSize0`,
  `Class.Beam.CurveSize1|CurveSize1`, and the orientation of the beam's
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`.

  - **P0** — The start of the beam; position of
    `Class.Beam.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
  - **P1** — `Class.Beam.CurveSize0|CurveSize0` studs away from
    `Class.Beam.Attachment0|Attachment0`, in the positive **X** direction of
    `Class.Beam.Attachment0|Attachment0`.
  - **P2** — `Class.Beam.CurveSize1|CurveSize1` studs away from
    `Class.Beam.Attachment1|Attachment1`, in the negative **X** direction of
    `Class.Beam.Attachment1|Attachment1`.
  - **P3** — The end of the beam; position of
    `Class.Beam.Attachment1|Attachment1`

    description: |
      Determines the color of the beam across its
      `Class.Beam.Segments|Segments`. If `Class.Beam.Texture|Texture` is set,
      this color will be applied to the beam's texture. If no
      `Class.Beam.Texture|Texture` is set, the `Class.Beam` will appear as a
      solid line colored in accordance with this property.

      This property is a `Datatype.ColorSequence`, allowing the color to be
      configured to vary across the length of the beam. Consider the following
      `Datatype.ColorSequence` which, when applied to a beam, would yield the
      pictured result.

      ```lua
      local colorSequence = ColorSequence.new({
      		ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)),  -- Red
      		ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.fromRGB(0, 188, 203)),  -- Cyan
      		ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.fromRGB(196, 0, 255)),  -- Purple
      	}
      )
      ```

      <img src="/assets/lighting-and-effects/beam/ColorSequence-Applied.png" width="800" />

      Note the beam's coloration also depends on the number of
      `Class.Beam.Segments|Segments` the `Class.Beam` has. Each segment of the
      beam can only show a transition between two colors. Therefore a
      `Class.Beam` will need to have at least `n-1` segments in order for the
      color to display correctly, where `n` is the number of
      `Datatype.ColorSequenceKeypoint|ColorSequenceKeypoints` in the
      `Datatype.ColorSequence`.

      Rather than being a perfect curve, a beam is made up of straight segments.
      The more segments, the higher the resolution of the curve. The
      **Segments** property sets how many straight segments the beam is made up
      of, with a default value of 10.

      Note that the `Class.Beam.Color|Color` and
      `Class.Beam.Transparency|Transparency` properties require a certain number
      of segments to display correctly. This is because each segment can only
      show a transition between two colors or transparencies. Therefore a
      `Class.Beam` requires at least `n-1` segments to display correctly, where
      `n` is the number of keypoint associated with the beam's
      `Class.Beam.Color|Color` and `Class.Beam.Transparency|Transparency`.

      Sets the current offset of the beam's texture cycle.
    description: |
      The offset of a beam's texture cycle represents the progress of its
      texture animation. This method sets the current offset of the beam's
      texture cycle; hence, it can be used to reset the cycle by passing `0` as
      the `offset` parameter.

      #### Notes

      - The given `offset` parameter is expected to be a value between 0 and 1,
        but greater values can be used.
      - The texture cycle wraps at 0 and 1, meaning the texture is in the same
        position when the offset is at 0 or 1.
      - If the `Class.Beam.Texture|Texture` property is not set, this method
        does nothing.
      - Increasing the offset will act in the inverse direction to the
        `Class.Beam.TextureSpeed|TextureSpeed` property, meaning it will move
        the texture in the opposite direction to the direction the texture
        animates when `Class.Beam.TextureSpeed|TextureSpeed` is greater than 0.
