description: |
  A **RotateP** object joins two parts together and allows rotation about a set
  axis. The joint will attempt to rotate the two parts until a desired
  rotational position is reached. This object is most commonly created by the
  `Enum.SurfaceType.SteppingMotor` on a `Class.BasePart`. If created through a script, behavior is still governed by the surface input of `Class.JointInstance.Part0`.

  The three inputs of note are as follows:

  - `NoInput` &mdash; The joint will not rotate under its own power. It can
  still be rotated by external forces (such as from a character pushing one of
  the parts).
 
  - `Constant` &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the `ParamB` property of
  `Class.JointInstance.Part0`. This rotation is measured in radians per physics
  frame (which is approximately 1/60th of a second).
  
  - `Sin` &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the `ParamA` and `ParamB` properties of `Class.JointInstance.Part0`.

  This class works alongside the deprecated `Enum.SurfaceType` and should not be
  used for future work; use `Class.HingeConstraint` instead.
