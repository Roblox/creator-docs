  `Class.AudioPitchShifter` adjusts the perceived pitch of audio streams. It
  provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be connected
  to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`. `Class.AudioPitchShifter` performs its
  modifications in the frequency domain and may introduce artifacts with extreme
  pitch changes.
