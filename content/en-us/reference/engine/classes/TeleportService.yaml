  Enables transporting `Class.Player|Players` between places and servers.
description: |
  TeleportService is responsible for transporting `Class.Player|Players` between
  different places and servers.

  All teleporting functionality is consolidated into a single
  `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()` function, which is used to:

  - Teleport players to a different place
  - Teleport players to a specific server
  - Teleport players to a reserved server

  For more information on how to teleport players between servers, see
  [Teleporting Between Places](../../../projects/teleporting.md).

      This function returns the _customLoadingScreen_ the
      `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` arrived into the place with.

      Note, the _customLoadingScreen_ will not be used if the destination place
      is in a different game.

      #### Loading screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      If you wish to preserve the _customLoadingScreen_ and perform your own
      transitions, you will need to parent it to the
      `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's` `Class.PlayerGui`. For an
      example of this, see the code sample below.

      #### Studio limitation

    description: |
      This function retrieves a teleport setting saved using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` using the given key.

      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used
      on the server.

      Teleport settings are preserved across teleportations within the same
      game. This means data can be saved using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` in one place and retrieved
      using GetTeleportSetting in another place the user has been teleported to.

      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the
      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting.
      This could then be retrieved in the destination place after the
      teleportation:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

      local isCrouching =  TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting("isCrouching")
      ```

      If no teleport setting exists under the given key, this function will
      return _nil_.

      #### Differences from GlobalDataStores

      Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences
      between teleport settings and datastores:

      - `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()` stores the data on Roblox servers
        whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
      - Data stored in a `Class.GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user
        leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the
        server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas
        teleport settings do not

      In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side
      information within a single play session across different places in a
      game. `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save
      important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

      #### Teleport settings and security

      As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be
      manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing
      server side validation.

    description: |
      This function sets the custom `Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI` that will be
      shown to the local user during teleportation, prior to the teleport being
      invoked.

      Note, the `Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI` will not be used if the
      destination place is in a different game. It will also not persist across
      multiple teleports and will need to be set prior to each one.

      This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation
      function is called from the server (as is the case with
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`) then this function should be
      called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to
      a `Class.RemoteEvent` that fires several seconds before teleportation.

      #### Loading screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      This `Class.ScreenGui` can be fetched at the destination place using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()`, allowing you to parent
      it to the `Class.PlayerGui` and perform your own transitions.

      You are advised to also `Class.Instance.Parent|parent` the
      `Class.ScreenGui` to the `Class.PlayerGui` in the start place while the
      teleport is initiating.

      This function stores a value under a given key that persists across all
      teleportations in the same game.

      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used
      on the server.

      The stored value can later be retrieved using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting()`. This will work in the
      current place and any subsequent places the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`
      teleports to, provided they are in the same game.

      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the
      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

      local isCrouching = false
      TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting("isCrouching", isCrouching)
      ```

      The stored value can take one of the following forms:

      - A table without mixed keys (all strings or all integers)
      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      If data is already stored under the given key, the previous value will be
      overwritten by the new value.

      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas

      Teleports a `Class.Player` to the place associated with the given
      _placeId_.
    description: |
      The numerous teleport functions have been combined into a single method,
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()|TeleportAsync`, which should be
      used instead and may be used to:

      - Teleport any number of players to a Public Server
      - Follow a Friend to a Different Place
      - Teleport any number of Players to a Reserved Server

      This function teleports a `Class.Player` to the place associated with the
      given _placeId_.

      Teleport can be called both from the client and the server (see examples
      below).

      When teleporting from the client, as only the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`
      can be teleported, no _player_ argument is required.

      You may only teleport players to places within the same game or active
      start places for other games.

      #### Teleport data

      A _teleportData_ parameter can be specified. This is data the client will
      transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`.

      The _teleportData_ can take any of the following forms:

      - A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      As the _teleportData_ is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For
      this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive
      items (such as the users' score or in-game currency).

      If you need teleport data to persist across multiple teleports, you can
      use `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` and
      `Class.TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting()`.

      #### Loading screen

      A _customLoadingScreen_ argument can be specified. This is a
      `Class.ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the
      `Class.CoreGui` of the destination place.

      Note, `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportGui()` is the preferred
      alternative to the _customLoadingScreen_ argument as it can be called
      prior to the teleport.

      The loading `Class.ScreenGui` can be obtained in the destination place
      using `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()`, where developers
      can parent it to the `Class.PlayerGui`. It will not be used if the
      destination place is in a different game.

      #### Teleport failure

      In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the
      developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox's
      servers.

      - If a teleportation request is rejected the
        `Class.TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error
        message and a `Enum.TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue
      - Teleports can fail 'in transit', after the user has left the server, due
        to issues with Roblox's servers. In this case the user will be shown an
        error message and be required to rejoin the game

      The numerous teleport functions have been combined into a single method,
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()|TeleportAsync`, which should be

      - Teleport any number of players to a Public Server
      - Follow a Friend to a Different Place
      - Teleport any number of Players to a Reserved Server

      This function teleports a `Class.Player` to the place instance associated
      with the given _placeId_ and _instanceId_. It can only be used to teleport
      to places in the same game.

      The _placeId_ is the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId` of the server and the
      _instanceId_ is the `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId`.

      This function can not be used to teleport `Class.Player|Players` to
      servers created using `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServer()` (reserved
      servers). For this, see `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer()`.

      #### Spawn name

      An optional _spawnName_ parameter can be provided, which will cause the
      `Class.Player` to initially spawn at the `Class.SpawnLocation` of that
      name in the destination place. The `Class.SpawnLocation` must be valid for
      the `Class.Player` to spawn on. For example, it must be
      `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral|neutral` or set to the same
      `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor|TeamColor` as the `Class.Team` the
      `Class.Player` will be assigned to upon joining the game.

      #### Teleport data

      A _teleportData_ parameter can be specified. This is data the client will
      transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`.

      The _teleportData_ can take any of the following forms:

      - A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      As the _teleportData_ is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For
      this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive

      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      As the _teleportData_ is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For
      this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive
      items (such as the users' score or in-game currency).

      If you need teleport data to persist across multiple teleports, you can
      use `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` and
      `Class.TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting()`.

      #### Loading screen

      A _customLoadingScreen_ argument can be specified. This is a
      `Class.ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the
      `Class.CoreGui` of the destination place.

      You are advised to instead set the loading screen on the client using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportGui()`. The loading `Class.ScreenGui`
      should also be parented to the `Class.Player|Player's` `Class.PlayerGui` a
      few seconds before the teleport to ensure a smooth transition using a
      `Class.RemoteEvent`. For an example of this see
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportGui()|SetTeleportGui`

      The loading `Class.ScreenGui` can be obtained in the destination place
      using `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()`, where developers
      can parent it to the `Class.PlayerGui`.

      #### Teleport failure

      In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the
      developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox's
      servers.

      - If a teleportation request is rejected the
        `Class.TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error
        message and a `Enum.TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue
      - Teleports can fail 'in transit', after the user has left the server, due
        to issues with Roblox's servers. In this case the user will be shown an
        error message and be required to rejoin the game

      #### Studio limitation

    summary: |
      A variant of `Class.TeleportService:Teleport()` that causes the
      `Class.Player` to spawn at a `Class.SpawnLocation` of the given name at
      the destination place.
    description: |
      The numerous teleport functions have been combined into a single method,
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()|TeleportAsync`, which should be
      used instead and may be used to:

      - Teleport any number of players to a Public Server
      - Follow a Friend to a Different Place
      - Teleport any number of Players to a Reserved Server

      This function behaves the same as `Class.TeleportService:Teleport()` with
      the exception that it includes a _spawnName_ parameter, causing the
      `Class.Player` to spawn at the `Class.SpawnLocation` of that name at the
      destination place.

      The `Class.SpawnLocation` must be valid for the `Class.Player` to spawn
      on. For example, it must be `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral|neutral` or set
      to the same `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor|TeamColor` as the `Class.Team`
      the `Class.Player` will be assigned to upon joining the game.

      The `Class.Player` will still spawn at the correct `Class.SpawnLocation`
      even the teleport is to a place in a different universe. The spawn will
      also be correct if `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is false in the
      destination place and the `Class.Player.Character|Character` is loaded
      manually using `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()|LoadCharacter`.

      The teleportation will only affect the `Class.SpawnLocation` used
      initially. If the `Class.Player` respawns again subsequently it will not
      necessarily be at this `Class.SpawnLocation`.

      This function returns the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId|PlaceId` and
      `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId` of the server the user with the given
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` is in, provided it is in the same game as the
      current place.

      Then, `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPlaceInstance()` can be called with
      this information to allow a user to join the target user's server.

      Upon a successful lookup, the function returns the following values:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>#</th>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Type</th>

      			<td>The JobId of the server the user is in</td>
      		</tr>
      	</tbody>
      </table>

      If there is a problem during lookup, such as the user being offline, an
      error is thrown. It is recommended that you wrap calls to this function in
      `pcall`.

      #### Limitations

      You should be aware of the following limitations when using this function:

      - This function can only be called by the server.
      - This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is
        teleporting.
      - It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers
        should wrap it in a `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` (see example below)
      - As this function returns the JobId of the server and not the access code
        returned by `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServer()`, the id returned is
        not appropriate for use with reserved servers.

      #### Studio limitation

      This service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio &mdash; To
      test aspects of your game using it, you must publish the game and play it
      in the Roblox application.

    description: |
      This function returns an access code that can be used to teleport players
      to a reserved server, along with the `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId` for
      it.

      ReserveServer can only be called on the server.

      #### Reserved Servers

      You can access reserved servers using:

      - `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()` with the
        `Class.TeleportOptions.ReservedServerAccessCode` parameter.
      - `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer()`, with the access code
        `ReserveServer` returns.
        - A server is started when the access code is first used.
        - Access codes remain valid indefinitely, meaning reserved servers can
          still be joined if no game server is running (in this case a new
          server will be started).

      You can see if the current server is a reserved server by using the
      following code:

      ```lua
      local isReserved = game.PrivateServerId ~= "" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId == 0
      ```

      The `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId` is constant across all server
      instances associated with the server access code, the
      `Class.DataModel.JobId` is not.

      #### Studio limitation

      This service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio &mdash; To
      test aspects of your game using it, you must publish the game and play it
      in the Roblox application.

      #### Cross-Platform Play

      Players on Xbox One with cross-platform play disabled will arrive in a
      different server with players with cross-platform play enabled. This can
      cause multiple game servers with the same PrivateServerId to exist."

    description: |
      This function serves as the all-encompassing method to teleport a player
      or group of players from one server to another.

      All forms of player teleportation are consolidated into this single
      function, which is used to:

      - Teleport players to a different place
      - Teleport players to a specific server
      - Teleport players to a reserved server

      **Group Teleport Limitations**

      - Groups of players can only be teleported within a single experience.
      - No more than 50 players can be teleported with a single
        `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()` call.

      #### Potential Errors

      This is a list of potential reasons a teleport may fail, ranging from
      invalid teleports to network issues.

    description: |
      The numerous teleport functions have been combined into a single method,
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()|TeleportAsync`, which should be
      used instead and may be used to:

      - Teleport any number of players to a Public Server
      - Follow a Friend to a Different Place
      - Teleport any number of Players to a Reserved Server

      This function teleports a group of `Class.Player|Players` to the same
      server instance in the given place. It returns the `Class.DataModel.JobId`
      of the server instance the players were teleported to.

      This function can only be called from the server.

      You may only use this function to teleport to a place in the same game.
      This function can not teleport more than 50 `Class.Player|Players` in a
      single party.

      Currently this function may not work reliably when teleporting
      `Class.Player|Players` to the same place they are currently in.

      #### Teleport data

      A _teleportData_ parameter can be specified. This is data the clients will
      transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`.

      The _teleportData_ can take any of the following forms:

      - A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      As the _teleportData_ is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For
      this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive
      items (such as the users' score or in-game currency).

      #### Loading screen

      A _customLoadingScreen_ argument can be specified. This is a
      `Class.ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the
      `Class.CoreGui` of the destination place. It can be retrieved at the
      destination place using `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()`
      and will not be used if the destination place is in a different game.

      You are advised to instead set the loading screen on the client using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportGui()`. The loading `Class.ScreenGui`
      should also be parented to the `Class.Player|Players'`
      `Class.PlayerGui|PlayerGuis` a few seconds before the teleport to ensure a
      smooth transition using a `Class.RemoteEvent`. For an example of this see
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportGui()|SetTeleportGui`.

      #### Teleport failure

      In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the
      developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox's
      servers.

      - If a teleportation request is rejected the
        `Class.TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error
        message and a `Enum.TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue
      - Teleports can fail 'in transit', after the user has left the server, due
        to issues with Roblox's servers. In this case the user will be shown an
        error message and be required to rejoin the game

      #### Studio limitation

      This service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio &mdash; To
      test aspects of your game using it, you must publish the game and play it
      in the Roblox application.

      This function fires when the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer` enters the place
      following a teleport. The _teleportData_ and _customLoadingScreen_ are
      provided as arguments.

      When fetching _teleportData_ and the _customLoadingScreen_ you are advised
      to use `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()` and
      `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()` instead. This is because
      these functions can be called immediately without having to wait for this
      event to fire.

      This event should be connected immediately in a `Class.LocalScript`
      parented to `Class.ReplicatedFirst`. Otherwise, when the connection is
      made the event may have already fired.

      #### Loading screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      If you wish to preserve the _customLoadingScreen_ and perform your own
      transitions, you will need to parent it to the
      `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's` `Class.PlayerGui`. For example,
      using the following code inside a `Class.LocalScript` in
      `Class.ReplicatedFirst`:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")

      TeleportService.LocalPlayerArrivedFromTeleport:Connect(function(customLoadingScreen, teleportData)
          local playerGui = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
          ReplicatedFirst:RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen()

          customLoadingScreen.Parent = playerGui
          -- animate screen here
          wait(5)
          -- destroy screen
          customLoadingScreen:Destroy()
      end)
      ```

      The _customLoadingScreen_ will not be used if the destination place is in
      a different game.

      #### Studio limitation

      This service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio &mdash; To
      test aspects of your game using it, you must publish the game and play it
      in the Roblox application.

  - name: TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed
    summary: |
      Fires when a teleport fails to start, leaving the player in their current
      server.
    description: |
      This event fires on both the client and the server when a request to
      teleport from a function such as `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`
      fails and the player does not leave the current server. It provides a
      reason for the failure, as well as all of the information necessary to
      retry the teleport. If a group teleport fails, the event will fire once
      per player.

      #### TeleportOptions

      The `Class.TeleportOptions` object provided by this event is not identical
      to the one passed to the original `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`
      call. It is a new object populated with the necessary parameters to retry
      the teleport and send the player to the exact same destination. This is
      especially important for facilitating group teleports when they fail.
