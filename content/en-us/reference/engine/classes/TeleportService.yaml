    description: |
      This function returns the _customLoadingScreen_ the
      `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` arrived into the place with.

      Note, the _customLoadingScreen_ will not be used if the destination place
      is in a different game.

      #### Loading Screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      If you wish to preserve the _customLoadingScreen_ and perform your own
      transitions, you will need to parent it to the local player's
      `Class.PlayerGui`. For an example of this, see the code sample below.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

      This function returns the teleport data the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`
      arrived with. It can only be called from the client.

      Exploiters can spoof teleport data. Send secure data such as player
      currency through a server-side service such as `Class.DataStoreService` to
      prevent tampering.

    summary: |
      Returns the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId|PlaceId` and
      `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId` of the server the user with the given
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` is in provided it is in the same game as the
      current place.
    description: |
      This function returns the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId|PlaceId` and
      `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId` of the server the user with the given
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` is in, provided it is in the same game as the
      current place.

      Then, `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPlaceInstance()` can be called with
      this information to allow a user to join the target user's server.

      Upon a successful lookup, the function returns the following values:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>#</th>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Type</th>
      			<th>Description</th>
      		</tr>
      	</thead>
      	<tbody>
      		<tr>
      			<td><b>1</b></td>
         			<td> currentInstance</td>
      			<td>bool</td>
      			<td>A bool indicating if the user was found in the current instance</td>
      		</tr>
      		<tr>
      			<td><b>2</b></td>
         			<td>error</td>
      			<td>string</td>
      			<td>An error message in the event of the lookup failing</td>
      		</tr>
      		<tr>
      			<td><b>3</b></td>
         			<td>placeId</td>
      			<td>int64</td>
      			<td>The PlaceId of the server the user is in</td>
      		</tr>
      		<tr>
      			<td><b>4</b></td>
         			<td>instanceId</td>
      			<td>string</td>
      			<td>The JobId of the server the user is in</td>
      		</tr>
      	</tbody>
      </table>

      If there is a problem during lookup, such as the user being offline, an
      error is thrown. It is recommended that you wrap calls to this function in
      `pcall`.

      #### Limitations

      You should be aware of the following limitations when using this function:

      - This function can only be called by the server.
      - This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is
        teleporting.
      - It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers
        should wrap it in a `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` (see example below)
      - As this function returns the JobId of the server and not the access code
        returned by `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServerAsync()`, the ID
        returned is not appropriate for use with reserved servers.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

      Retrieves a teleport setting saved using

    description: |
      This function retrieves a teleport setting saved using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` using the given key.

      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used
      on the server.

      Teleport settings are preserved across teleportations within the same
      game. This means data can be saved using
      `Class.TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting()` in one place and retrieved
      using GetTeleportSetting in another place the user has been teleported to.

      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the
      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting.
      This could then be retrieved in the destination place after the
      teleportation:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

      local isCrouching = TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting("isCrouching")
      ```

      If no teleport setting exists under the given key, this function will
      return _nil_.

      #### Differences from GlobalDataStores

      Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences
      between teleport settings and datastores:

      - `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()` stores the data on Roblox servers
        whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
      - Data stored in a `Class.GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user
        leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the
        server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas
        teleport settings do not

      In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side
      information within a single play session across different places in a
      game. `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save
      important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

      #### Teleport settings and security

      As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be
      manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing
      server side validation.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

      The player can choose to teleport to the target experience through the
      prompt.
    description: |
      Prompts the specified `Class.Player` with information of the specified
      experience. The prompt includes the experience name, creator name,
      maturity rating, etc. The prompt also includes a **Join** button which the
      player can use to be teleported to the target experience. If the player is
      ineligible to join the target experience, the button will be disabled.

      Any teleport failures after the player clicks the **Join** button will
      also fire `Class.TeleportService.TeleportInitFailed` providing a reason
      for the failure.

      #### Limitations

      - For security purposes, teleporting a user from your experience to
        another experience owned by others fails by default. See
        [here](../../../projects/teleport.md#enable-cross-experience-teleportation)
        for steps to enable cross-experience teleportation.
      - This function currently can only be called from the client with
        `Class.Players.LocalPlayer` as the `player` parameter.
      - The join button will always be disabled during Studio playtesting; to
        test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
        experience and play it in the Roblox application.

      Returns an access code that can be used to teleport players to a reserved
      server, along with the `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId` for it.
    description: |
      This function returns an access code that can be used to teleport players
      to a reserved server, along with the server's
      `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId`. It can only be called on the server.

      #### Reserved Servers

      You can access reserved servers using:

      - `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()` with the
        `Class.TeleportOptions.ReservedServerAccessCode` parameter.
      - `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToPrivateServer()`, with the access code
        `ReserveServerAsync` returns.
        - A server is started when the access code is first used.
        - Access codes remain valid indefinitely, meaning reserved servers can
          still be joined if no game server is running (in this case a new
          server will be started).

      You can see if the current server is a reserved server by using the
      following code:

      ```lua
      local isReserved = game.PrivateServerId ~= "" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId == 0
      ```

      The `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId` is constant across all server
      instances associated with the server access code, the
      `Class.DataModel.JobId` is not.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

      #### Cross-Platform Play

      Players on Xbox and PlayStation with cross‑play disabled will arrive in a
      different server than players with cross‑play enabled. This can cause
      multiple game servers with the same
      `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerId|PrivateServerId` to exist. You can use
      `Class.DataModel.MatchmakingType` to differentiate these game servers.
    code_samples:
      - TeleportService-ReserveServer1

      Sets the custom `Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI` that will be shown to the

    description: |
      This function sets the custom `Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI` that will be
      shown to the local user during teleportation, prior to the teleport being
      invoked.

      Note, the `Class.ScreenGui|teleport GUI` will not be used if the
      destination place is in a different game. It will also not persist across
      multiple teleports and will need to be set prior to each one.

      This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation
      function is called from the server (as is the case with
      `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`) then this function should be
      called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to
      a `Class.RemoteEvent` that fires several seconds before teleportation.

      #### Loading screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      This `Class.ScreenGui` can be fetched at the destination place using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()`, allowing you to parent
      it to the `Class.PlayerGui` and perform your own transitions.

      You are advised to also `Class.Instance.Parent|parent` the
      `Class.ScreenGui` to the `Class.PlayerGui` in the start place while the
      teleport is initiating.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

    description: |
      This function stores a value under a given key that persists across all
      teleportations in the same game.

      This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used
      on the server.

      The stored value can later be retrieved using
      `Class.TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting()`. This will work in the
      current place and any subsequent places the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`
      teleports to, provided they are in the same game.

      For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the
      user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

      local isCrouching = false
      TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting("isCrouching", isCrouching)
      ```

      The stored value can take one of the following forms:

      - A table without mixed keys (all strings or all integers)
      - A string
      - A number
      - A bool

      If data is already stored under the given key, the previous value will be
      overwritten by the new value.

      #### Differences from GlobalDataStores

      Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences
      between teleport settings and datastores:

      - `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()` stores the data on Roblox servers
        whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
      - Data stored in a `Class.GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user
        leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the
        server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
      - `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas
        teleport settings do not

      In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side
      information within a single play session across different places in a
      game. `Class.GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save
      important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

      one server to another.
    description: |
      This function serves as the all-encompassing method to teleport a player
      or group of players from one server to another. It can be used to:

      - Teleport players to a different place.
      - Teleport players to a specific server.
      - Teleport players to a reserved server.

      #### Group Teleport Limitations

      - Groups of players can only be teleported within a single experience.
      - No more than 50 players can be teleported with a single
        `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()` call.

      #### Potential Errors

      This is a list of potential reasons a teleport may fail, ranging from
      invalid teleports to network issues.

    summary: |
      Fires when the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` enters the place
      following a teleport.
    description: |
      This function fires when the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer` enters the place
      following a teleport. The `teleportData` and `customLoadingScreen` are
      provided as arguments.

      When fetching _teleportData_ and the _customLoadingScreen_ you are advised
      to use `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()` and
      `Class.TeleportService:GetArrivingTeleportGui()` instead. This is because
      these functions can be called immediately without having to wait for this
      event to fire.

      This event should be connected immediately in a `Class.LocalScript`
      parented to `Class.ReplicatedFirst`. Otherwise, when the connection is
      made the event may have already fired.

      #### Loading Screen

      During a teleport, while the destination place is loading, the
      _customLoadingScreen_ is parented to the `Class.CoreGui`. Once the place
      has loaded the `Class.ScreenGui|loading screen` is
      `Class.Instance.Parent|parented` to _nil_.

      If you wish to preserve the _customLoadingScreen_ and perform your own
      transitions, you will need to parent it to the local player's
      `Class.PlayerGui`. For example, using the following code inside a
      `Class.LocalScript` in `Class.ReplicatedFirst`:

      ```lua
      local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")

      TeleportService.LocalPlayerArrivedFromTeleport:Connect(function(customLoadingScreen, teleportData)
      	local playerGui = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
      	ReplicatedFirst:RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen()

      	customLoadingScreen.Parent = playerGui
      	-- animate screen here
      	wait(5)
      	-- destroy screen
      	customLoadingScreen:Destroy()
      end)
      ```

      The _customLoadingScreen_ will not be used if the destination place is in
      a different game.

      #### Studio Limitation

      Note that this service does not work during playtesting in Roblox Studio;
      to test aspects of your experience using it, you must publish the
      experience and play it in the Roblox application.

    summary: |
      Fires when a teleport fails to start, leaving the player in their current
      server.
    description: |
      This event fires on both the client and the server when a request to
      teleport from a function such as `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`
      fails and the player does not leave the current server. It provides a
      reason for the failure, as well as all of the information necessary to
      retry the teleport. If a group teleport fails, the event will fire once
      per player.

      #### TeleportOptions

      The `Class.TeleportOptions` object provided by this event is not identical
      to the one passed to the original `Class.TeleportService:TeleportAsync()`
      call. It is a new object populated with the necessary parameters to retry
      the teleport and send the player to the exact same destination. This is
      especially important for facilitating group teleports when they fail.
