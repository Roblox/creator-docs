description: |
  A **PlaneConstraint** moves its `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` and
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` into a position/orientation along a
  plane whose normal vector is the primary axis of
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. Both parent assemblies remain free
  to translate and rotate unless otherwise constrained.
