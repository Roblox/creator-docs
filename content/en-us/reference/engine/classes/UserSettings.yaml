  UserSettings is a singleton object that is used to house basic user settings,
  which persist across all games. Currently, it only stores the
  `Class.UserGameSettings` object.

  You can retrieve a reference to this object via the
  `Class.UserSettings|UserSettings()` function, which returns it.

      Returns true if the specified user feature is enabled. This will throw an
      error if the user feature does not exist.

      This function checks against a list of FFlags, whose name starts with
      "User". The function is intended to be used by Roblox-created scripts, and
      functions similarly to `Class.GlobalSettings:GetFFlag()`.

      Erases the saved state of the UserSettings, and restores its values back
      to default. This function will fail to run correctly from a LocalScript,
      as it does not have permission to restore all of the properties in the
      `Class.UserGameSettings` class.
