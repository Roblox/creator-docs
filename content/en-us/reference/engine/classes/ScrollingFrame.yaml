      This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the
      size of its descendants. You can use this property to dynamically add text
      and other content to a `ScrollingFrame` at edit or run time and the size
      will adjust to fit that content.

      When this property is set to an `Enum.AutomaticSize` value other than
      `Enum.AutomaticSize|None`,
      `Class.ScrollingFrame.AbsoluteCanvasSize|AbsoluteCanvasSize` may resize
      depending on its child content.
