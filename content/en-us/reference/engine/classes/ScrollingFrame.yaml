      child content.
    description: |
      This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the
      size of its descendants. Developers can use this property to dynamically
      add text and other content to a UI object at edit or run time, and the
      size will adjust to fit that content.

      When AutomaticCanvasSize is set to an
      `Enum.AutomaticSize|Enum.AutomaticSize` value to anything other than None,
      `Class.ScrollingFrame.CanvasSize` may resize depending on its child
      content.

      Determines how a scrolling bar image is colorized. When set to white, no
      colorization occurs. This property is very useful for reusing image
      assets: If the source image is completely white with transparency, you can
      set the entire color of the image at once with this property.
