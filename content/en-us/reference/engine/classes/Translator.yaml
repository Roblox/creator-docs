description: |
  The role of a Translator is to manufacture/return strings localized for the
  viewing player. It can be used to retrieve display-ready localized text from a
  `Class.LocalizationTable`. The source of the `Class.Translator.LocaleId`
  property, the set of tables it will search, and the order it will search them
  in depends on which method was used to create the Translator instance.

  The input for a Translator is the original development language string and a
  context, where all or part of the context can be used to find a more
  precise/situational translation for the source string.

  The Translator can also be used to manufacture translated strings with inserts
  (data replacements) which may change order based on the target language.

      Returns the localized text string in a `Class.LocalizationTable` based on
      its `Class.Translator` locale, by key. The optional **args** table is used
      for filling format parameters in the matching text entry.

      Note that this method will throw an error in the following cases:

      - If none of the `Class.LocalizationTable|LocalizationTables` available to
        this `Class.Translator` include a value for the given key.
      - If the
        [format string](../../../production/localization/translate-dynamic-content.md)
        for the key uses numbered parameters and **args** is not an array.
      - If the
        [format string](../../../production/localization/translate-dynamic-content.md)
        uses named parameters and **args** is not a table of key-value pairs.
      - If **args** is missing values for parameters that are used in the
        matching
        [format string](../../../production/localization/translate-dynamic-content.md).

      #### Context Overrides

      In some cases, duplicate **Source** strings may have completely different
      translations in other languages. For example, the English noun "Screen"
      can indicate both a computer screen and a window screen, but the Spanish
      translations are completely different:

      <table>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="12%">A</td>
            <td width="16%">B</td>
            <td width="18%">C</td>
            <td width="12%">D</td>
            <td width="18%">E</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Key</td>
            <td>Context</td>
            <td><b>Source</b></td>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td><b>es</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Screen</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Pantalla</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Screen</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Mosquitero</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> </td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      In these cases, the first argument to this function &mdash; a valid
      in-game `Class.Instance` &mdash; can be used as a "tie breaker" when
      multiple GUI objects use the same source string. To implement this,
      specify the "path" to the `Class.Instance` you'd like to override as the
      **Context** value of the translation data:

      <table>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td width="12%">A</td>
            <td width="36%">B</td>
            <td width="18%">C</td>
            <td width="12%">D</td>
            <td width="18%">E</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Key</td>
            <td><b>Context</b></td>
            <td>Source</td>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>es</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>workspace.ComputerScreen.SurfaceGui.TextLabel</td>
            <td>Screen</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Pantalla</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Screen</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>Mosquitero</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> </td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      Then, when calling this function in a script, pass the same
      `Class.Instance` as the first argument, followed by the **Source** lookup
      text as the second argument:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local LocalizationService = game:GetService("LocalizationService")

      local success, translator = pcall(function()
      	return LocalizationService:GetTranslatorForPlayerAsync(Players.LocalPlayer)
      end)

      if success then
      	local trans = translator:Translate(workspace.ComputerScreen.SurfaceGui.TextLabel, "Screen")
      	print(trans)
      else
      	warn("Cannot load translator for player!")
      end
      ```

        summary: |
          A valid in-game `Class.Instance` to use for context override as
          outlined above. Note that this argument can be arbitrary, for example
          `game`, if you don't require a context override.
