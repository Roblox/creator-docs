    summary: |
      Angle of cylindrical sector (pie-slice).
    description: |
      If `Angle` is `<360`, a cylindrical sector (aka a pie-slice) of that angle
      is rendered instead of a full cylinder. The `Angle` property can be
      combined with `InnerRadius` to render a sector of a hollow cylinder.
