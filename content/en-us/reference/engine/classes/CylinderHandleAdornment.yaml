  A cylinder-shaped handle that can be adorned to a `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  `CylinderHandleAdornment` is a cylinder-shaped handle that can be adorned to a
  `Class.BasePart`. If parented to a player's `Class.PlayerGui` or the
  `Class.CoreGui`, handles can listen to input events for purposes such as
  making dragger tools.

    summary: |
      Angle of the cylinder handle as in a "pie slice" sector.
    description: |
      The angle of the cylinder handle as in a "pie slice" sector. For example,
      if set to `90`, a quarter cylinder will render instead of a full cylinder.
      This property can be combined with
      `Class.CylinderHandleAdornment.InnerRadius|InnerRadius` to render a sector
      of a hollow cylinder.

    summary: |
      Inner radius with which to render a hollow cylinder.
    description: |
      The inner radius with which to render a hollow cylinder, in studs. For
      example, if `Class.CylinderHandleAdornment.Radius|Radius` is `2` and
      `InnerRadius` is `1`, the adornment will be a hollow cylinder with a "wall
      thickness" of 1 stud. This property can be combined with
      `Class.CylinderHandleAdornment.Angle|Angle` to render a sector of a hollow
      cylinder.
