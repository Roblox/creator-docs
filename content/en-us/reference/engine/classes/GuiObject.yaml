  An abstract class for all 2D user interface objects.
description: |
  **GuiObject** is an abstract class (much like `Class.BasePart`) for a 2D user
  interface object. It defines all the properties relating to the display of a
  graphical user interface (GUI) object such as `Class.GuiObject.Size|Size` and
  `Class.GuiObject.Position|Position`. It also has some useful readâ€‘only
  properties like `Class.GuiObject.AbsolutePosition|AbsolutePosition`,
  `Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize`, and
  `Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteRotation|AbsoluteRotation`.

  To manipulate the layout of GUI objects in special ways, you can use a layout
  structure such as [list/flex](../../../ui/list-flex-layouts.md) or
  [grid](../../../ui/grid-table-layouts.md), and you can style them beyond their
  core properties through [appearance
  modifiers](../../../ui/appearance-modifiers.md).

  Although it's possible to detect mouse button events on any GUI object using
  `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan|InputBegan` and
  `Class.GuiObject.InputEnded|InputEnded`, only `Class.ImageButton` and
  `Class.TextButton` have convenient dedicated events such as
  `Class.TextButton.Activated|Activated` to detect click/press.

      Determines whether this UI element sinks input.
    description: |
      This property determines whether this `Class.GuiObject` will sink input to
      3D space, such as underlying models with a `Class.ClickDetector` class
      such as `Class.DragDetector`. In other words, if the player attempts to
      click the detector with the mouse hovering over an active UI element, the
      UI will block the input from reaching the detector.

      For `Class.GuiButton` objects (`Class.ImageButton` and
      `Class.TextButton`), this property determines whether
      `Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated` fires
      (`Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor|AutoButtonColor` will still work for
      those as well). The events `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan|InputBegan`,
      `Class.GuiObject.InputChanged|InputChanged`, and
      `Class.GuiObject.InputEnded|InputEnded` work as normal no matter the value
      of this property.

    description: |
      The **AnchorPoint** property determines the origin point of a
      `Class.GuiObject`, relative to its absolute size. The origin point
      determines from where the element is positioned (through
      `Class.GuiObject.Position`) and from which the rendered
      `Class.GuiObject.Size` expands.

    description: |
      This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the
      size of its descendants. You can use this property to dynamically add text
      and other content to a UI object at edit or run time, and the size will
      adjust to fit that content.

      When **AutomaticSize** is set to an `Enum.AutomaticSize` value to anything
      other than `Enum.AutomaticSize|None`, this UI object may resize depending
      on its child content.

      For more information on how to use this property and how it works, please

      This property controls the sorting order of the `Class.GuiObject` when
      using a `Class.UIGridStyleLayout` (such as `Class.UIListLayout` or
      `Class.UIPageLayout`) with `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder|SortOrder`
      set to `Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder`. It has no functionality if the object
      does not have a sibling UI layout structure.

      `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` are sorted in ascending order where lower
      values take priority over higher values. Objects with equal values fall
      back to the order they were added in.

      If you are unsure if you'll need to add an element between two existing
      elements in the future, it's a good practice to use multiples of `100`
      (`0`, `100`, `200`, etc.). This ensures a large gap of layout order values
      which you can use for elements ordered in-between other elements.

      See also `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex` which determines the object's
      **rendering** order instead of sorting order.

    description: |
      This property determines whether the `Class.GuiObject` can be selected
      when navigating GUIs using a gamepad.

      If this property is true, a GUI can be selected. Selecting a GUI also sets
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property to that object.

      When this is false, the GUI cannot be selected. However, setting this to
      false when a GUI is selected will not deselect it nor change the value of
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property.

      Add `Class.GuiObject.SelectionGained` and `Class.GuiObject.SelectionLost`
      will not fire for the element. To deselect a GuiObject, you must change
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property.

      This property is useful if a GUI is connected to several GUIs via
      properties such as this `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionUp`,
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionDown`, `Class.GuiObject|NextSelectionRight`,
      or `Class.GuiObject|NextSelectionLeft`. Rather than change all of the
      properties so that the Gamepad cannot select the GUI, you can disable its
      Selectable property to temporarily prevent it from being selected. Then,
      when you want the gamepad selector to be able to select the GUI, simply
      re-enable its selectable property.

      affects that element. To affect all of a user's GUI elements, set the
      `Class.PlayerGui.SelectionImageObject` property.

      To determine or set which GUI element is selected by the user, you can use
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property. The player uses the
      gamepad to select different GUI elements, invoking the
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionUp|NextSelectionUp`,
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionDown|NextSelectionDown`,
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionLeft|NextSelectionLeft`, and
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionRight|NextSelectionRight` events.

      This property determines the `Class.GuiObject` scalar and pixel size using
      a `Datatype.UDim2`.

      The scalar size is relative to the size of the parent GUI element, if any.

      The pixel portions of the `Datatype.UDim2` value are the same regardless
      of the parent GUI's size. The values represent the size of the object in
      pixels. An object's actual pixel size can be read from the
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize` property.

      If the `Class.GuiObject` has a parent, its size along each axis is also
      influenced by the parent's
      `Class.GuiObject.SizeConstraint|SizeConstraint`.

      The rendering of individual components of a `Class.GuiObject` can be

      otherwise occupy in the layout is used by other elements instead.

    description: |
      This property determines the order in which a `Class.GuiObject` renders
      relative to others.

      By default, `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` render in ascending priority
      order where those with lower **ZIndex** values are rendered under those
      with higher values. You can change the render order within a
      `Class.ScreenGui`, `Class.SurfaceGui`, or `Class.BillboardGui` by changing
      the value of its `Class.LayerCollector.ZIndexBehavior|ZIndexBehavior`.

      If you are unsure if you'll need to add an element between two existing
      elements in the future, it's a good practice to use multiples of `100`
      (`0`, `100`, `200`, etc.). This ensures a large gap of render order values
      which you can use for elements layered in-between other elements.

      See also `Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder|LayoutOrder` which controls the
      **sorting** order of a `Class.GuiObject` when used with a layout structure
      such as `Class.UIListLayout` or `Class.UIGridLayout`.

      GUI. These coordinates may vary even when the mouse enters the GUI via the
      same edge - particularly when the mouse enters the element quickly. This

      Please do not rely on the `x` and `y` arguments passed by this event as a
      fool-proof way to determine where the user's mouse is when it leaves a
      GUI. These coordinates may vary even when the mouse leaves the GUI via the
      same edge - particularly when the mouse leaves the element quickly. This
      is due to the fact the coordinates indicate the position of the mouse when
      the event fires rather than the exact moment the mouse leaves the GUI.

      This event fires even when the GUI element renders beneath another
      element.

      Fires whenever a user moves their mouse while it is inside a GUI element.
    description: |
      Fires whenever a user moves their mouse while it is inside a
      `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element. It is similar to `Class.Mouse.Move`, which
      fires regardless whether the user's mouse is over a GUI element.

      Note, this event fires when the mouse's position is updated, therefore it
      will fire repeatedly while being moved.

      The `x` and `y` arguments indicate the updated screen coordinates of the
      user's mouse in pixels. These can be useful to determine the mouse's
      location on the GUI, screen, and delta since the mouse's previous position
      if it is being tracked in a global variable.

      The code below demonstrates how to determine the `Datatype.Vector2` offset
      of the user's mouse relative to a GUI element:

      ```lua
      local CustomScrollingFrame = script.Parent
      local SubFrame = CustomScrollingFrame:FindFirstChild("SubFrame")

      local mouse = game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetMouse()
      function getPosition(X, Y)
      	local gui_X = CustomScrollingFrame.AbsolutePosition.X
      	local gui_Y = CustomScrollingFrame.AbsolutePosition.Y


      	local pos = Vector2.new(math.abs(X - gui_X), math.abs(Y - gui_Y - 36))
      	print(pos)
      end

      CustomScrollingFrame.MouseMoved:Connect(getPosition)
      ```

      Note that this event may not fire exactly when the user's mouse enters or
      exits a GUI element. Therefore, the `x` and `y` arguments may not match up
      perfectly to the coordinates of the GUI's edges.

    description: |
      The WheelBackward event fires when a user scrolls their mouse wheel back
      when the mouse is over a `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element. It is similar to
      `Class.Mouse.WheelBackward`, which fires regardless whether the user's
      mouse is over a GUI element.

      This event fires merely as an indicator of the wheel's backward movement.
      This means that the x and y mouse coordinate arguments don't change as a
      result of this event. These coordinates only change when the mouse moves,
      which can be tracked by the `Class.GuiObject.MouseMoved` event.

      mouse is over a GUI element.

      This event fires merely as an indicator of the wheel's forward movement.

      multiple times: `Enum.UserInputState.Begin` after a brief delay,
      `Enum.UserInputState.Change` if the player moves their finger during the
      gesture, and finally `Enum.UserInputState.End`. The delay is platform

    description: |
      The **TouchPinch** event fires when the player uses two fingers to make a
      pinch or pull gesture on the UI element using a touch-enabled device. A
      **pinch** happens when two or more fingers move closer together, and a
      **pull** happens when they move apart. This event fires in conjunction
      with `Class.GuiObject.TouchPan`. This event is useful for allowing the
      player to manipulate the scale (size) of UI elements on the screen, and is
      most often used for zooming features.

      This event fires with a table of `Datatype.Vector2` that describe the
      relative screen positions of the fingers involved in the gesture. In
