  An abstract class for all 2D user interface objects.
description: |
  GuiObject is an abstract class (much like `Class.BasePart`) for a 2D user
  interface object. It defines all the properties relating to the display of a
  graphical user interface (GUI) object such as `Class.GuiObject.Size` and
  `Class.GuiObject.Position`. It also has some useful read-only properties like
  `Class.GuiObject.AbsolutePosition`, `Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteSize`, and
  `Class.GuiObject.AbsoluteRotation`. It should be noted that `Class.GuiObject`
  can have negative sizes and render normally, though
  `Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint` ought to be used to better control rendering.

  To manipulate the layout of a GuiObject in special ways, you can use a
  `Class.UIComponent` class such as `Class.UIListLayout`, `Class.UIPadding` or
  `Class.UIScale`.

  This class defines very simple animation methods:
  `Class.GuiObject:TweenPosition()`, `Class.GuiObject:TweenSize()` and
  `Class.GuiObject:TweenSizeAndPosition()` are good alternatives to
  `Class.TweenService` for beginners.

  GuiObject also defines events for user input like
  `Class.GuiObject.MouseEnter`, `Class.GuiObject.TouchTap`,
  `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan`, `Class.GuiObject.InputChanged` and
  `Class.GuiObject.InputEnded`. The last three of these mimic the events of
  `UserInputService` of the same name. Although it is possible to detect mouse
  button events on any GuiObject using `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan`, only
  `Class.ImageButton` and `Class.TextButton` have dedicated events for these
  (e.g. `Class.TextButton.MouseButton1Down`). This event ought not be used for
  general button activation since not all platforms use a mouse; see
  `Class.TextButton.Activated`.

      Determines whether a UI element sinks input.
    description: |
      This property determines whether a `Class.GuiObject` will sink input to 3D
      space, such as underlying models with a `Class.ClickDetector`. In other
      words, if the player attempts to click a ClickDetector with the mouse
      hovering over an Active UI element, the UI will block the input from
      reaching the ClickDetector.

      For `Class.GuiButton` objects (`Class.ImageButton` and
      `Class.TextButton`), this property determines whether
      `Class.GuiButton.Activated` fires (`Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor` will
      still work for those as well). The events
      `Class.GuiObject.InputBegan|InputBegan`,
      `Class.GuiObject.InputChanged|InputChanged`, and
      `Class.GuiObject.InputEnded|InputEnded` work as normal no matter the value
      of this property.

      Determines whether resizing occurs based on child content.
    description: |
      This property is used to automatically size parent UI objects based on the
      size of its descendants. Developers can use this property to dynamically
      add text and other content to a UI object at edit or run time, and the
      size will adjust to fit that content.

      When AutomaticSize is set to an `Enum.AutomaticSize|Enum.AutomaticSize`
      value to anything other than None, this UI object may resize depending on
      its child content.

      Another property that determines the visual properties of the background
      is `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency`. If an element's
      BackgroundTransparency is set to 1, neither the background nor the border
      will render and the element will be transparent.

      If your element contains text, such as a `Class.TextBox`,
      `Class.TextButton`, or `Class.TextLabel`, make sure the color of your
      background contrasts the text's color.

      determined `Class.TextBox.TextTransparency`,
      `Class.TextButton.TextTransparency`, and
      `Class.TextLabel.TextTransparency` respectively.

      If the property is set to 1, neither the background nor the border will

      The `Class.UIStroke` component allows for more advanced border effects.

      BorderColor3 determines the color of a `Class.GuiObject|UI` element's
      rectangular border (also known as the stroke color).

      This is separate from the UI element's `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3`.
      If you set a UI element's border and background colors to the same color,
      you will be unable to distinguish the two.

      Other properties that determine the visual properties of the border
      include `Class.GuiObject.BorderSizePixel` and
      `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency`.

      Note that you will not be able to see an element's border if its
      BorderSizePixel property is set to 0.

      This property controls the sorting order of a `Class.GuiObject|GUI` when

      `Class.UIPageLayout`) with `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.SortOrder` set to
      `Enum.SortOrder|Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder`. It has no functionality if
      the GUI does not have a sibling UI Layout.

      It is a signed 32-bit int, so it can be set to any value from
      -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive). GUIs are placed in ascending
      order where lower values take more priority over, and are ordered before,
      higher values. Values that are equal will fall back to the order they were
      added in.

      If you are unsure if you will need to add an element between two
      already-existing elements in the future, it can be a good idea to use
      multiples of 100, i.e. 0, 100, 200. This ensures a large gap of
      LayoutOrder values you can use for elements ordered in-between other
      elements.

    summary: |
      Determines the pixel and scalar position of a `GUI`.
    description: |
      This property determines a `Class.GuiObject|GUI's` pixel and scalar size
      using a `Datatype.UDim2`. Its value can be expressed as
      `UDim2.new(ScalarX, PixelX, ScalarY, PixelY)` or
      `({ScalarX, PixelX}, {ScalarY, PixelY})`. Position is centered around a
      GUI's `Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint`.

      An element's position can also be set by modifying both its scalar and
      pixel positions at the same time. For instance, its position can be set to
      `({0.25, 100}, {0.25, 100})`.

      The scalar position is relative to the size of the parent GUI element. For
      example, if AnchorPoint is set to `0, 0` and Position is set to
      `{0, 0}, {0, 0}`, the element's top left corner renders at the top left
      corner of the parent element. Similarly, if AnchorPoint is set to `0, 0`
      and Position is set to `{0.5, 0}, {0.5, 0}`, the element's top left corner
      will render at the direct center of the parent element.

      The pixel portions of the `Datatype.UDim2` value are the same regardless
      of the parent GUI's size. The values represent the position of the object
      in pixels. For example, if set to `{0, 100}, {0, 150}` the element's
      AnchorPoint will render with on the screen 100 pixels from the left and
      150 pixels from the top.

      An object's actual pixel position can be read from the
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsolutePosition` property.

    description: |
      This property determines the number of degrees by which a

      A GUI's `Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint` does not influence it's rotation.
      This means that you cannot change the center of rotation since it will
      always be in the center of the object.

      Additionally, this property is **not compatible** with
      `Class.GuiObject.ClipsDescendants`. If an ancestor (parent) object has
      ClipsDescendants enabled and this property is nonzero, then descendant GUI
      elements will not be clipped.

    description: |
      This property determines whether a ~GuiObject|GUI` can be selected when
      navigating GUIs using a gamepad.

      If this property is true, a GUI can be selected. Selecting a GUI also sets
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property to that object.

      When this is false, the GUI cannot be selected. However, setting this to
      false when a GUI is selected will not deselect it nor change the value of
      the GuiService's SelectedObject property.

      Add `Class.GuiObject.SelectionGained` and `Class.GuiObject.SelectionLost`
      will not fire for the element. To deselect a GuiObject, you must change
      `Class.GuiService|GuiService's` SelectedObject property.

      This property is useful if a GUI is connected to several GUIs via
      properties such as this `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionUp`,
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionDown`, `Class.GuiObject|NextSelectionRight`,
      or `Class.GuiObject|NextSelectionLeft`. Rather than change all of the
      properties so that the Gamepad cannot select the GUI, you can disable its
      Selectable property to temporarily prevent it from being selected. Then,
      when you want the gamepad selector to be able to select the GUI, simply
      re-enable its selectable property.

      This property overrides the default selection adornment (used for
      gamepads). For best results, this should point to a `Class.GuiObject|GUI`.

      Note that the SelectionImageObject overlays the selected GUI with the
      `Class.GuiObject.Size` of the image. For best results when using a
      non-default SelectionImageObject, you should size the SelectionImageObject
      via the scale `Datatype.UDim2` values. This helps ensure that the object
      scales properly over the selected element.

      The default SelectionImageObject is a blue and white square outline around
      the selected GUI element. In the image below, the selected GUI is a white
      `Class.Frame`.

      ![Default SelectionImageObject](/assets/legacy/Screen_Shot_2018-09-13_at_9.57.14_PM.png)

      For instance, changing the SelectionImageObject to a `Class.ImageLabel`
      with red and white square outline
      [image](https://www.roblox.com/library/2347505468/SelectionImage-Red),
      `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency` of 1, `Class.GuiObject.Size` of
      _UDim2(1.1, 0, 1.1, 0)_, and `Class.GuiObject.Position` of _UDim2(-0.05,
      0, -0.05, 0)_ results in the image below:

      ![Custom SelectionImageObject](/assets/legacy/Screen_Shot_2018-09-13_at_9.53.54_PM.png)

      Changing the SelectionImageObject for a GUI element only affects that
      element. To change the SelectionImageObject for all of a user's GUI
      elements, you can set the `Class.PlayerGui.SelectionImageObject` property.

      To determine or set which GUI element is selected by the user, you can use
      the `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject` property. The user uses the gamepad
      to select different GUI elements, invoking the
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionUp`, `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionDown`,
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionLeft`, and
      `Class.GuiObject.NextSelectionRight` events.

      Determine the pixel and scalar size of a `Class.GuiObject|GUI`.
    description: |
      This property determines a `Class.GuiObject|GUI's` scalar and pixel size
      using a `Datatype.UDim2`. Its value can be expressed as
      `UDim2.new(ScalarX, PixelX, ScalarY, PixelY)` or
      `({ScalarX, PixelX}, {ScalarY, PixelY})`.

      The scalar size is relative to the scalar size of parent GUI elements, if
      any. For example, if the GUI's scalar size is `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)`
      and it is not the descendant of a GUI, then it will occupy half of the
      screen horizontally and vertically. However, if the GUI is the child of a
      GUI with a scalar size of `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)`, then the GUI's
      scalar size will render to be half the scalar size of its parent both
      horizontally and vertically and will occupy a quarter of the screen in
      both dimensions.

      The pixel portions of the `Datatype.UDim2` value are the same regardless
      of the parent GUI's size. The values represent the size of the object in
      pixels. For example, if Position is set to `{0, 100}, {0, 150}` the
      element will render with a width of 100 pixels and height of 150 pixels.

      If the GUI has a parent, its size of each axis is also influenced by the
      parent's `Class.GuiObject.SizeConstraint|SizeConstraint`.

      Using negative sizes may result in undefined behavior in some cases, such
      as with `Class.UIConstraint`. It is preferable to change
      `Class.GuiObject.AnchorPoint|AnchorPoint` instead of using negative sizes.

      An object's actual pixel size can be read from the
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize` property.

      The `Enum.SizeConstraint` enum will determine the axes that influence the

      This property is useful for creating onscreen controls that are meant to
      scale with either the width or height of a parent object, but not both.
      This preserves the aspect ratio of the GUI element in question. For
      example, setting to RelativeYY with a Size of `{1, 0}, {1, 0}` will make
      the UI element square, with both the X and Y sizes equal to the parent
      element's Y size.

    description: |
      This property determines the order in which a `Class.GuiObject|GUI`
      renders to the screen relative to other GUIs.

      By default, GUIs render in ascending priority order where lower values are
      rendered first. As a result, GUIs with lower ZIndex values appear under
      higher values. You can change the render order by changing the value of
      `Class.ScreenGui.ZIndexBehavior`.

      The range of valid values is -MAX_INT to MAX_INT, inclusive (2,147,483,647
      or (2^31 - 1)). If you are unsure if you will need to layer an element
      between two already-existing elements in the future, it can be a good idea
      to use multiples of 100, i.e. 0, 100, 200. This ensures a large gap of
      ZIndex values you can use for elements rendered in-between other elements.

      The MouseEnter event fires when a user moves their mouse into a
      `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element.

      Please do not rely on the `x` and `y` arguments passed by this event as a
      fool-proof way to determine where the user's mouse is when it enters a
      GUI. These coordinates may vary even when the mouse enters the GUI via the
      same edge - particularly when the mouse enters the element quickly. This
      is due to the fact the coordinates indicate the position of the mouse when
      the event fires rather than the exact moment the mouse enters the GUI.

      This event fires even when the GUI element renders beneath another
      element.

      If you would like to track when a user's mouse leaves a GUI element, you
      can use the `Class.GuiObject.MouseLeave` event.

      Fires whenever a user moves their mouse while it is inside a GUI element.
    description: |
      Fires whenever a user moves their mouse while it is inside a
      `Class.GuiObject|GUI` element. It is similar to `Class.Mouse.Move`, which
      fires regardless whether the user's mouse is over a GUI element.

      Note, this event fires when the mouse's position is updated, therefore it
      will fire repeatedly while being moved.

      The `x` and `y` arguments indicate the updated screen coordinates of the
      user's mouse in pixels. These can be useful to determine the mouse's
      location on the GUI, screen, and delta since the mouse's previous position
      if it is being tracked in a global variable.

      The code below demonstrates how to determine the `Datatype.Vector2` offset
      of the user's mouse relative to a GUI element:

      ```lua
      local CustomScrollingFrame = script.Parent
      local SubFrame = CustomScrollingFrame:FindFirstChild("SubFrame")

      local mouse = game.Players.LocalPlayer:GetMouse()
      function getPosition(X, Y)
      	local gui_X = CustomScrollingFrame.AbsolutePosition.X
      	local gui_Y = CustomScrollingFrame.AbsolutePosition.Y


      	local pos = Vector2.new(math.abs(X - gui_X), math.abs(Y - gui_Y - 36))
      	print(pos)
      end

      CustomScrollingFrame.MouseMoved:Connect(getPosition)
      ```

      Note that this event may not fire exactly when the user's mouse enters or
      exits a GUI element. Therefore, the `x` and `y` arguments may not match up
      perfectly to the coordinates of the GUI's edges.

      mouse is over a GUI element.

      This event fires merely as an indicator of the wheel's backward movement.
      This means that the x and y mouse coordinate arguments don't change as a

    description: |
      The TouchTap event fires when the player performs a tap gesture on the UI
      element using a touch-enabled device. A tap is a quick single touch
      without any movement involved (a longer press would fire
      `Class.GuiObject.TouchLongPress`, and moving during the touch would fire
      `Class.GuiObject.TouchPan` and/or `Class.GuiObject.TouchSwipe`). It fires
      with a table of `Datatype.Vector2`s that describe the relative positions
      of the fingers involved in the gesture.

      Since this event only requires one finger, it can be simulated in Studio
      using the emulator and a mouse.
