      #### Exceptions

      Like any async call, this needs to be wrapped in a `pcall` and
      error-handled properly. A full list of possible error messages and their
      reasons is as below:

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Message</th>
      <th>Reason</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
       <tr>
      <td>Instance was not a player</td>
      <td>Dev's usage - The parameter is not a Player instance</td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
      <td>Players not found</td>
        <td>Internal error - Players object missing</td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
      <td>This method cannot be called on the client for a non-local player</td>
      <td>Dev's usage - This method cannot be called on the client for a non-local player</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync is called too many times</td>
      <td>Internal error - GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync is called more than 100(current setting) times before http response coming back</td>
      </tr>
       	</tbody>
      </table>
