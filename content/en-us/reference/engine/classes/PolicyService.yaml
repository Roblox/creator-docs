      ##### Exceptions

      Like any async call, this method needs to be wrapped in
      `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` and error-handled properly. A full list of
      possible error messages and their reasons is:

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Message</th>
      <th>Reason</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td>Instance was not a player</td>
      <td>The <code>player</code> parameter is not a <code>Class.Player</code> instance.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Players not found</td>
      <td>Internal error that the <code>Class.Players</code> object is missing.</td>
      </tr>
       <tr>
      <td>This method cannot be called on the client for a non-local player</td>
      <td>This method cannot be called on the client for a non-local <code>Class.Player</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync is called too many times</td>
      <td>Internal error that <code>GetPolicyInfoForPlayerAsync()</code> is called more than 100 (current setting) times before an HTTP response comes back.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

      See also `Class.LocalizationService:GetCountryRegionForPlayerAsync()`
      which returns a country/region code string according to the player's
      client IP geolocation.
