  The TremoloSoundEffect creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying the
  volume of the sound up and down.

  Like all other `Class.SoundEffect|SoundEffects`, a TremoloSoundEffect can be
  applied either to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being parented to
  either.

      Controls how much the volume will raise and lower.
    description: |
      Range: 0 to 1 (default 1) Controls how much the volume will raise and
      lower. This value ranges between 0 (minimum volume) and 1 (maximum
      volume). If set to its minimum, the volume will not oscillate at all.
