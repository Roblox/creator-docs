name: HttpService
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Allows sending HTTP requests and provides various web-related and JSON
  methods.
description: |
  `HttpService` allows HTTP requests to be sent from experience servers using
  `Class.HttpService:RequestAsync()|RequestAsync`,
  `Class.HttpService:GetAsync()|GetAsync` and
  `Class.HttpService:PostAsync()|PostAsync`. This service allows experiences to
  be integrated with third-party web services such as analytics, data storage,
  remote server configuration, error reporting, advanced calculations, or
  real-time communication. Additionally, it can call a subset of the Open Cloud
  APIs.

  For more information about these use cases, see
  [In-experience HTTP requests](../../../cloud-services/http-service.md).

  `HttpService` also houses the `Class.HttpService:JSONEncode()|JSONEncode` and
  `Class.HttpService:JSONDecode()|JSONDecode` methods, which are useful for
  communicating with services that use the [JSON](https://json.org) format. In
  addition, the `Class.HttpService:GenerateGUID()|GenerateGUID` method provides
  random 128‑bit labels which can be treated as probabilistically unique in a
  variety of scenarios.

  Within Studio, use
  `Class.HttpService:CreateWebStreamClient()|CreateWebStreamClient()` to process
  data in real time from servers that support streaming protocols such as
  [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events),
  [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding),
  and [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). You can connect
  callback functions to stream events, allowing you to process data immediately
  as it arrives instead of waiting for the entire response to complete.

  Only send HTTP requests to trusted third-party platforms to avoid introducing
  unnecessary security risks to your experience.

    summary: |
      Creates a client that opens a persistent connection to stream data.
    description: |
      This method creates a client that establishes a long-lived connection to
      servers utilizing various streaming technologies, such as
      [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).
      After the connection is established, the client fires signals that you can
      connect callback functions to with `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection`. Use
      these callbacks to process messages as soon as they arrive, as well as
      respond to open, close, and error events.

      There is a limit of six total clients allowed at one time. Close streams
      that you no longer need with `Class.WebStreamClient:Close()`. When the
      stream is no longer needed, you should disconnect any associated
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection|RBXScriptConnections` to avoid memory leaks.

      This method is available in Studio only. If you use it inside scripts,
      make sure to remove any references before publishing the experience. We
      encourage you to create plugins with this feature for reusability and ease
      of use.

    summary: |
      Generates a UUID/GUID random string, optionally with curly braces.
    description: |
      This method generates a **random universally unique identifier**
      ([UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))
      string. The sixteen octets of a UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal
      (base&nbsp;16) digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens in
      the form `8-4-4-4-12` for a total of 36 characters, for example
      `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000`.

      The UUID specification used is
      [Version 4 (random)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>),
      variant 1 (DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996). UUIDs of this version are the
      most commonly used due to their simplicity, as they are entirely randomly
      generated. Note that this version does not have certain features that
      other UUID versions have, such as encoded timestamps, MAC addresses, or
      time-based sorting like [UUIDv7](https://uuid7.com/) or
      [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec).

      There are over 5.3&times;10<sup>36</sup> unique v4 UUIDs, in which the
      probability of finding a duplicate within 103 trillion UUIDs is one in a
      billion.

      The `wrapInCurlyBraces` argument determines whether the returned string is
      wrapped in curly braces (`{}`). For instance:

      - `true`: `{94b717b2-d54f-4340-a504-bd809ef5bf5c}`

    summary: |
      Sends an HTTP `GET` request.
    description: |
      This method sends an HTTP `GET` request. It functions similarly to
      `Class.HttpService:RequestAsync()|RequestAsync()` except that it accepts
      HTTP request parameters as method parameters instead of a single
      dictionary and returns only the body of the HTTP response. Generally, this
      method is useful only as a shorthand and
      `Class.HttpService:RequestAsync()|RequestAsync()` should be used in most
      cases.

      When `true`, the `nocache` parameter prevents this method from caching
      results from previous calls with the same `url`.

      This method transforms a JSON object or array into a Luau
      [table](../../../luau/tables.md) with the following characteristics:

      - Keys of the table are strings or numbers but not both. If a JSON object
        contains both, string keys are ignored.
      - An empty JSON object generates an empty Luau table (`{}`).
      - If the `input` string is not a valid JSON object, this method will throw
        an error.

      To encode a Luau table into a JSON object, use the
      `Class.HttpService:JSONEncode()` method.

      This method can be used regardless of whether HTTP requests are enabled.

      Generate a JSON string from a Luau table.
    description: |
      This method transforms a Luau [table](../../../luau/tables.md) into a JSON
      object or array based on the following guidelines:

      - Keys of the table must be either strings or numbers. If a table contains
        both, an array takes priority (string keys are ignored).
      - An empty Luau table (`{}`) generates an empty JSON array (e.g. `[]`).
      - The value `nil` is never generated.
      - Cyclic table references cause an error.

      This method allows values such as `inf` and `nan` which are not valid
      JSON. This may cause problems if you want to use the outputted JSON
      elsewhere.

      This method also accepts `Library.buffer|buffers` up to 50 MiB, which it
      encodes to base64 (and often compresses) before converting to a JSON
      object.

      To reverse the encoding process and decode a JSON object, use the
      `Class.HttpService:JSONDecode()` method.

      This method can be used regardless of whether HTTP requests are enabled.

      method is useful only as a shorthand and
      `Class.HttpService:RequestAsync()|RequestAsync()` should be used in most

      ##### Supported HTTP methods

      The HTTP request methods specify the purpose of the request being made and
      what is expected if the request is successful. For instance, the `GET`
      request method tells the server at the requested address that a resource
      is being requested and, if it succeeds, the resource at that address will
      be returned. Similarly, the `HEAD` request method does the same except the
      server knows to return a response without a `Body` element.

          </tbody>
      </table>

      ##### HTTP headers

      In the request dictionary, you can specify custom HTTP headers to use in
      the request. However, some headers cannot be specified. For example,
      `Content-Length` is determined from the request body. `User-Agent` and
      `Roblox-Id` are locked by Roblox. Other headers like `Accept` or
      `Cache-Control` use default values but can be overridden. More commonly,
      some REST APIs may require API keys or other service authentication to be
      specified in request headers.

      The `RequestAsync()` method does not detect the format of body content.
      Many web servers require the `Content-Type` header be set appropriately
      when sending certain formats. Other methods of `Class.HttpService` use the
      `Enum.HttpContentType` enum; for this method set the `Content-Type` header
      appropriately: `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `application/xml`,
      `application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` are replacement
      `Content-Type` header values for the respective enum values.

      ##### Response dictionary fields

      `RequestAsync()` returns a dictionary containing the following fields:

      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Name</th>
                  <th>Type</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td><code>Success</code></td>
                  <td>Boolean</td>
                  <td>The success status of the request. This is true if and only if the <code>StatusCode</code> lies within the range <code>200</code>-<code>299</code>.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td><code>StatusCode</code></td>
                  <td>Integer</td>
                  <td>The HTTP response code identifying the status of the response.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td><code>StatusMessage</code></td>
                  <td>String</td>
                  <td>The status message that was sent back.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td><code>Headers</code></td>
                  <td>Dictionary</td>
                  <td>A dictionary of headers that were set in this response.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td><code>Body</code></td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>The request body (content) received in the response.</td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>

      ##### Error Cases

      `RequestAsync()` raises an error if the response times out or if the
      target server rejects the request. If a web service goes down for some
      reason, it can cause scripts that use this method to stop functioning
      altogether. It is often a good idea to wrap calls to this method in
      `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` and gracefully handle failure cases if the
      required information isn't available.

      ##### Limitations

      The current limitation for sending and receiving **external** HTTP
      requests is 500 requests per minute. There is also a separate limit of
      2500 requests per minute for
      [Open Cloud requests](../../../cloud-services/http-service.md#use-with-open-cloud).
      Requests over these thresholds will fail.

      This method
      [percent-encodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) a given
      string so that reserved characters properly encoded with `%` and two
      hexadecimal characters.

      This is useful when formatting URLs for use with
      `Class.HttpService:GetAsync()`/`Class.HttpService:PostAsync()`, or `POST`
      data of the media type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
      (`Enum.HttpContentType|Enum.HttpContentType.ApplicationUrlEncoded`).

      For instance, when you encode the URL `https://www.roblox.com/discover#/`,
      this method returns `https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eroblox%2Ecom%2Fdiscover%23%2F`.
