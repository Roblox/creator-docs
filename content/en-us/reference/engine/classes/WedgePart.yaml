description: |
  A type of `Class.BasePart` that has a wedge shape. WedgeParts are great for
  building slopes because of their slanted surface. They can even be rotated
  onto their slant so that they can be used at an angle to make a triangular
  ramp. WedgeParts can be adjusted to any size a regular brick can so that they
  can be aligned with the rest of your building work. WedgeParts, when used next
  to each other at different angles, can also make great curved ramps without
  the need for CFrame too.
