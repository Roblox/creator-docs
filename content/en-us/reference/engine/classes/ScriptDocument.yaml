memory_category: Instances
summary: ''
description: |
  A `Class.ScriptDocument` instance is a proxy of the document of a Studio
  Script Editor. It's different from the `Class.LuaSourceContainer` open in the
  editor in that it represents the ephemeral state of an open document, and its
  representation is in a format that's more suited for reading and editing code
  than executing it. In particular, `Class.ScriptDocument` reflects any changes
  that have been made to the open script in Drafts Mode, which the source
  property doesn't.

  The Script Editor itself exists and changes on a different thread than any
  `Class.DataModel`, so the `Class.ScriptDocument` replicates the open Script
  Editor, but it isn't the open editor. Because of the replication, there's
  sometimes a slight delay between changing the text in the editor and updating
  the `Class.ScriptDocument`. The delay usually occurs because the
  `Class.DataModel` is busy, and it's almost always extremely small, but it
  still exists.

  The existence of a `Class.ScriptDocument` indicates that a document is open in
  the Script Editor. All `Class.ScriptDocument` instances have
  `Class.ScriptEditorService` as its parent. Each instance adheres to the
  following encoding conventions:

  - All text in `Class.ScriptDocument` is UTF-8 encoded.
  - All line indices are 1-indexed.
  - All character indices are 1-indexed and count UTF-8 bytes, not graphemes, so
    the same warning from `Class.TextBox.CursorPosition` applies: many Unicode
    characters take more than one byte.
  - All ranges are inclusive of their start position and exclusive of their end
    position, so start == end implies an empty range.

  All APIs for `Class.ScriptDocument` are at **Plugin** level security.

      Requests that the editor associated with this document close. Yields the
      current thread until the editor responds to the request. If the function
      succeeds, it returns (true, nil). If the function fails, it returns
      (false, string) as a description of the problem.

      This function can't close the command bar.

    summary: |
      Replaces the text in the specified range from (`startLine`, `startColumn`)
      to (`endLine`, `endColumn`) with newText.
    description: |
      Replaces the text in the specified range from (`startLine`, `startColumn`)
      to (`endLine`, `endColumn`) with `newText`. If the range is empty, then
      the function inserts the text at (`startLine`, `startColumn`). If the text
      cursor is within the specified range, the cursor moves to the end position
      of the edit. Otherwise, the text cursor doesn't move. This function yields
      the current thread until it receives a reply from the editor about the
      edit.

      If the function succeeds, it returns (`true`, `nil`).

      The function throws an error if:

      - The range is invalid.
      - The range would slice a unicode character, for example replace only some
        of the bytes of the unicode character.
      - The `newText` itself contains invalid UTF-8.

      If the function fails, it returns (false, string). The string is a
      description of the problem. The most common failure type is a version
      mismatch. This occurs when you try to call `EditTextAsync` during the time
      when the `Class.ScriptDocument` is out of sync with the contents of the
      editor. If this happens, you can retry the edit.

      Asks the editor to set its cursor selection to the argument values. Both
      anchor arguments must be passed, or neither. If neither is passed, then
      they each default to being the same as the corresponding cursor argument.
      The editor might decline to update its cursor if the text content of the
      document has changed. Unlike
      `Class.ScriptDocument:RequestSetSelectionAsync()`, the editor will not
      decline to move its cursor if the cursor has moved since the request was
      made. Returns (true, nil) if the cursor was updated, and (false, string)
      with an explanation string if it was not. Yields the current thread until
      the editor replies.
