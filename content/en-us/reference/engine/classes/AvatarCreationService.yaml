      Gets data regarding rules that assets must abide by to pass UGC
      validation. Validation is an essential step before creating avatars and
      there are various checks that occur, including mesh triangle limits,
      texture sizes, body part size limits, attachment positions, and more.

      The returned dictionary of validation rules takes the following form:

      Prompts a `Class.Player` to purchase and create an avatar from a
      `Class.HumanoidDescription`.
    description: |
      Prompts a `Class.Player` to purchase and create an avatar from a
      `Class.HumanoidDescription`. The price of the creation is dictated by the
      price attributed to the avatar creation token. This avatar creation token
      is required for the purchasing and creation of the body and can be
      generated by following the
      [token creation](../../../production/monetization/avatar-creation-token.md)
      process.

      For avatar creation, the `Class.HumanoidDescription` is expected to
      include new assets to be created for each of the 6 body parts
      (`Enum.BodyPart.Head|Head`, `Enum.BodyPart.Torso|Torso`,
      `Enum.BodyPart.RightLeg|RightLeg`, `Enum.BodyPart.LeftLeg|LeftLeg`,
      `Enum.BodyPart.RightArm|RightArm`, `Enum.BodyPart.LeftArm|LeftArm`).
      Optionally, it can also include a new `Enum.AccessoryType.Hair|Hair`
      accessory.

      To support this, the `Class.HumanoidDescription` should include 6
      `Class.BodyPartDescription` children (one for each body part). For each,
      the `Class.BodyPartDescription.Instance` property references a
      `Class.Folder` which includes all of the `Class.MeshPart` instances which
      make up the body part, for example a `LeftArm` folder which has
      `LeftHand`, `LeftUpperArm`, and `LeftLowerArm` `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`.
      The `Class.BodyPartDescription.BodyPart` property should also be set to
      the relevant `Enum.BodyPart`.

      Each body part `Class.MeshPart` will also need to include:

      - An `Class.EditableImage`.
      - A `Class.WrapDeformer` with an `Class.EditableMesh`.

      If including an accessory such as hair, the `Class.HumanoidDescription`
      should include a child `Class.AccessoryDescription` where:

      - The `Class.AccessoryDescription.Instance` property references the
        `Class.Accessory` instance.
      - The `Class.AccessoryDescription.AccessoryType` property is set to the
        relevant `Enum.AccessoryType`.

      Finally, the `Class.HumanoidDescription` should include the humanoid
      scales of `Class.HumanoidDescription.BodyTypeScale|BodyTypeScale`,
      `Class.HumanoidDescription.HeadScale|HeadScale`,
      `Class.HumanoidDescription.HeightScale|HeightScale`,
      `Class.HumanoidDescription.WidthScale|WidthScale`, and
      `Class.HumanoidDescription.ProportionScale|ProportionScale`. Be mindful of
      the scales that a base body is imported with so that they match the scales
      provided to the `Class.HumanoidDescription`.

            bundle ID. In the case of any failure enum, this will indicate the
            resultant error message.

          - A secondary optional string result. In the case of
            `Enum.PromptCreateAvatarResult.Success`, this will indicate the
