      Returns a table of `Class.Constraint|Constraints` and
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments` which you may choose to preserve, along
      with their respective parents. Iterating over this table lets you decide
      whether to reparent recommended constraints and attachments to their
      respective parents.

          An original object that the solid modeling operation was performed on,
          for example `part` in

        summary: |
          Options dictionary for the method:

          - `tolerance` — The distance tolerance, in regards to
            `Class.Attachment` preservation, between the attachment and the
            closest point on the original part's surface versus the closest
            point on the resulting part's surface. If the resulting distance
            following the solid modeling operation is greater than this value,
            the `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` of attachments and their
            associated constraints will be `nil` in the returned recommendation
            table.
          - `weldConstraintPreserve` — A `Enum.WeldConstraintPreserve` enum
            value describing how `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints` are
            preserved in the resulting recommendation table.
          - `dropAttachmentsWithoutConstraints` — Boolean with default of
            `true`. If set to `false`, `Class.Attachment|Attachments` that have
            no `Class.Constraint|Constraints` will be preserved.
    returns:

      Creates one or more `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` from the
      intersecting geometry of one part and other parts.
    description: |
      Creates one or more `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` from the
      intersecting geometry of the main part and other parts in the given array.
      Only primitive `Class.Part|Parts` and `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations`
      are supported, not `Class.Terrain` or `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`. Similar
      to `Class.Instance:Clone()|Clone()`, the returned parts have no set
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent`.

      The following properties from the main part (`part`) are applied to the
      resulting `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations`:

      - `Class.BasePart.Color|Color`, `Class.BasePart.Material|Material`,
        `Class.BasePart.MaterialVariant|MaterialVariant`,
        `Class.BasePart.Reflectance|Reflectance`,
        `Class.BasePart.Transparency|Transparency`
      - `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|CanCollide`
      - `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored`, `Class.BasePart.Density|Density`,
        `Class.BasePart.Elasticity|Elasticity`,
        `Class.BasePart.ElasticityWeight|ElasticityWeight`,
        `Class.BasePart.Friction|Friction`,
        `Class.BasePart.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight`

      In the following image comparison,
      `Class.GeometryService:IntersectAsync()|IntersectAsync()` is called using
      the purple block and an array containing the blue block. The resulting
      `Class.PartOperation` resolves into a shape of the intersecting geometry
      of both parts.

      #### Notes

      - Compared to `Class.BasePart:IntersectAsync()`, this method differs as
        follows:

        - The input parts do not need to be parented to the scene, allowing for
          background operations.
        - When the `SplitApart` option is set to `true` (default), each distinct
          body will be returned in its own `Class.PartOperation`.
        - Each of the returned parts are in the coordinate space of the main
          part. This means that the `(0, 0, 0)` of any returned part is not
          necessarily at the center of its body.
        - It's possible to call this method on the client, but with some
          limitations. First, it currently must be done with objects **created**
          on the client. Secondly, there is no replication available from client
          to the server.

      - The original parts remain intact following a successful operation. In
        most cases, you should parent the returned
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` to the same place as the main part,
        then `Class.Instance.Destroy|Destroy()` all of the original parts.

      - By default, the face colors of the resulting
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` are borrowed from the
        `Class.BasePart.Color|Color` property of the original parts, although
        you can enable their `Class.PartOperation.UsePartColor|UsePartColor`
        property to change them to a specific color.

      - If an intersect operation would result in any
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` with more than 20,000 triangles,
        they will be simplified to 20,000. This will result in an error with
        code `-14`.

      - If the main part is moving during the calculation of the operation, you
        can set the resulting parts to the updated `Datatype.CFrame` of the main
        part, since the returned parts are in the same coordinate space as the
        main part.

      - If using this method with a `Class.PartOperation` as the main part, you
        can substitute the geometry of another `Class.PartOperation` via
        `Class.PartOperation:SubstituteGeometry()|SubstituteGeometry()`, making
        it easier to utilize the geometry of the operation but maintain
        properties, attributes, tags, and children of the main part such as
        `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
        `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, light objects, and decals.
        This approach also circumvents the potential "flicker" of completely
        replacing the original `Class.PartOperation` with another.

            `Class.PartOperation.FluidFidelity|FluidFidelity` in the resulting
            parts.
          - `SplitApart` — Boolean controlling whether the objects should all be
            kept together or properly split apart. Default is `true` (split).

        `Class.BasePart.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight`

      In the following image comparison,
      `Class.GeometryService:UnionAsync()|UnionAsync()` is called using the blue
      block and an array containing the purple cylinder. The resulting
      `Class.PartOperation` resolves into a shape of the combined geometry of
      both parts.

      #### Notes

      - Compared to `Class.BasePart:UnionAsync()`, this method differs as
        follows:

        - The input parts do not need to be parented to the scene, allowing for
          background operations.
        - When the `SplitApart` option is set to `true` (default), each distinct
          body will be returned in its own `Class.PartOperation`.
        - Each of the returned parts are in the coordinate space of the main
          part. This means that the `(0, 0, 0)` of any returned part is not
          necessarily at the center of its body.
        - It's possible to call this method on the client, but with some
          limitations. First, it currently must be done with objects **created**
          on the client. Secondly, there is no replication available from client
          to the server.

      - The original parts remain intact following a successful operation. In
        most cases, you should parent the returned
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` to the same place as the main part,
        then `Class.Instance.Destroy|Destroy()` all of the original parts.

      - By default, the colors of the resulting
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` are borrowed from the
        `Class.BasePart.Color|Color` property of the original parts, although
        you can enable their `Class.PartOperation.UsePartColor|UsePartColor`
        property to change them to a specific color.

      - If a union operation would result in any
        `Class.PartOperation|PartOperations` with more than 20,000 triangles,
        they will be simplified to 20,000. This will result in an error with
        code `-14`.

      - If the main part is moving during the calculation of the operation, you
        can set the resulting parts to the updated `Datatype.CFrame` of the main
        part, since the returned parts are in the same coordinate space as the
        main part.

      - If using this method with a `Class.PartOperation` as the main part, you
        can substitute the geometry of another `Class.PartOperation` via
        `Class.PartOperation:SubstituteGeometry()|SubstituteGeometry()`, making
        it easier to utilize the geometry of the operation but maintain
        properties, attributes, tags, and children of the main part such as
        `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
        `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, light objects, and decals.
        This approach also circumvents the potential "flicker" of completely
        replacing the original `Class.PartOperation` with another.
