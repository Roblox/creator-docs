name: RemoteFunction
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object which facilitates synchronous, two-way communication across the
  client-server boundary. Scripts invoking a `Class.RemoteFunction` yield until
  they receive a response from the recipient.
description: |
  The **RemoteFunction** object facilitates synchronous, two-way communication
  across the [client-server](../../../projects/client-server.md) boundary. You
  can use it to define a custom callback function and invoke it manually by
  calling `Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeClient()` or
  `Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeServer()`. The code invoking the function
  **yields** until it receives a response from the recipient.

  In order for both the server and clients to access a `Class.RemoteFunction`
  instance, it must be in a place where both sides can see it, such as
  `Class.ReplicatedStorage`, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it
  in `Class.Workspace` or inside a `Class.Tool`.

  If the result is **not** needed, it is recommended that you use a
  `Class.RemoteEvent` instead, since its call is asynchronous and doesn't need
  to wait for a response to continue execution. See
  [Remote Events and Callbacks](../../../scripting/events/remote.md) for code
  samples and further details on `Class.RemoteFunction`.

  #### Streaming Precautions

  Note that if an invoked `Class.RemoteFunction` creates an instance on the
  server, there is no guarantee that it exists on the client when the function
  returns. This is particularly important in places where instance
  [streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md) is enabled and when the created
  instances are `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` or `Class.Model|Models`, since parts
  that are far away from the player's character may not be streamed to the
  client, and models that are `Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Atomic` depend on whether
  their parts are streamed. Even if a model is
  `Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Persistent`, there may be some delay between the
  creation of the model and when it is replicated to the client.

  #### Parameter Limitations

  Any type of Roblox object such as an `Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, or
  others can be passed as a parameter when a `Class.RemoteFunction` is invoked,
  as well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you
  should carefully explore the
  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/remote.md#argument-limitations).

      #### Warning

      In practice, the server does not often invoke the client, as clients
      typically do not have information that the server doesn't have, and
      actions that only a client can take, such as displaying a GUI, typically
      do not require a callback. As such, `Class.RemoteEvent:FireClient()` is
      recommended as an asynchronous method that doesn't need to wait for a
      response to continue execution.

      If you legitimately need to invoke a client from the server, note the
      following risks:

      - If the client throws an error, the server throws the error too.
      - If the client disconnects while it's being invoked,
        `Class.RemoteFunction:InvokeClient()|InvokeClient()` throws an error.
      - If the client doesn't return a value, the server yields forever.
