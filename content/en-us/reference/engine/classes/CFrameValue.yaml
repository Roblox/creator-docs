      Fired whenever the `Class.CFrameValue.Value` of the CFrameValue is
      changed.
    description: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.CFrameValue.Value` of the `Class.CFrameValue` is
      changed. It will run with the new value being stored in the argument
      object, instead of a string representing the property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      CFrameValue changes and to track the different values that it may change
      to.

      For instance, this even may be useful in games that rely on CFrameValues
      to track game object `Datatype.CFrame` positions and movements.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
