name: SunRaysEffect
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Renders dynamic rays from the sun.
description: |
  The **SunRaysEffect** renders a halo of light around sun. The halo is
  shaped/blocked by world objects between the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`
  and the sun.

  Like other post-processing effects, **SunRaysEffect** will only work while
  `Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled` and when parented to `Class.Lighting` or
  `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. Also, it may not render on low-end devices,
  and it may render differently depending on your Studio settings (see the
  **Quality Level** settings in **Rendering** &rarr; **Performance**).

  For more details on this effect and others, see
  [Post-Processing Effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md).

      value should be set between 0 and 1 as values outside that range have
