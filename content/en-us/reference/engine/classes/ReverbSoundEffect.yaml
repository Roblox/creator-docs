  Reverberates audio, simulating the effect of bouncing off walls in a room.
description: |
  The **ReverbSoundEffect** simulates the effect of sounds bouncing off of
  several surfaces (such as walls in a room), which causes several overlapping
  echoes that arrive at the listener at slightly offset times.

  Like all other `Class.SoundEffect|SoundEffects`, a `Class.ReverbSoundEffect`
  can be applied either to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being
  parented to either.

      Range: 0.1 to 20 (default 1.5) Sets how long it takes for the
      reverberating echoes to fade out completely. Larger decay times simulate
      larger (empty) spaces

      Range: 0 to 1 (default 1) Controls how smooth and reflective the simulated
      surfaces are. The lower this value, the more discrete the echoes are. At
      higher levels the echos will blend more.
