summary: |
  The WrapLayer object defines a 3D accessory's inner and outer surfaces and
  other properties related to layering accessories. These surfaces, or the Inner
  Cage and Outer Cage, are similar to collision boxes, and describe the surfaces
  of which other 3D accessories can be placed without clipping or breaking.

  other properties related to layering accessories. These surfaces, or the Inner
  Cage and Outer Cage, are similar to collision boxes, and describe the surfaces
  of which other 3D accessories can be placed without clipping or breaking.

  Internally, WrapLayer also uses the UV layout of the Inner and Outer cages to
  match coordinates to another 3D object's cage. This powers the deformation of
  objects around differently shaped avatars and underlying accessories.

      `Datatype.CFrame` to adjust a binding point for a clothing item mesh.
      Allows for fine-tuning of clothing items (slight adjustment of
      position/rotation to get a unique look) in contexts such as community-made
      avatar editors.

      Controls the composition order for layered clothing. Clothing items with
      higher order will appear on top of clothing items with lower order. If two
      items have the same order, the deformer composition order is ambiguous and
      depends on serialization order. Default value is 1.

      Controls how much underlying clothing items inflate the current clothing
      item.

      Valid range is -1 to 1. A value of -1 compresses the clothing, body, and
      all underlying layers such that the clothing itself takes the shape of the
      body. A value of 0 makes the clothing item fit as if it was the only piece
      of clothing being worn, compressing all underlying layers. A value of 1
      (default) never compresses anything and infinitely inflates over
      underlying clothing items.

      AssetID for reference mesh used to define Inner Cage of a 3D object

      Reference mesh is used to define standard topology and UV coordinates for
      index matching. It is expected that for all catalog avatars, this will
      point to one of 15 standard reference meshes provided by Roblox. But for
      some NPCs or a custom avatar system, this might point to other meshes.

      This property is intended for fine-tuning purposes and is highly optional.

      Allows slight shrinking/expanding of the resulting render mesh, without
      affecting any other layers. This is useful in rare cases when the clothing
      mesh does not precisely fit the underlying clothing layers (the cage is
      usually slightly overestimated atop the real shape to avoid layer
      interpenetration). Even slight overestimation has the tendency to
      accumulate, especially when there are a lot of layers. While this is
      usually not critical, some items like backpacks may be problematic.

      Valid range is -1 to 1. A value of -1 will maximally expand while a value
      of 1 will maximally shrink. A value of 0 (default) has no effect.
