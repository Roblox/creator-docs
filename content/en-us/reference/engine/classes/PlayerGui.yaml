name: PlayerGui
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container for a player's currently rendered `Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis`.
description: |
  `Class.PlayerGui` is a container that holds a player's UI. If a
  `Class.ScreenGui` is a descendant, then any `Class.GuiObject` inside of the
  `Class.ScreenGui` will be drawn to the player's screen. Any
  `Class.LocalScript` will also run if it is inserted into a `Class.PlayerGui`.

  When a player first joins the experience, their `Class.PlayerGui` is
  automatically inserted into their `Class.Player` object. When the player's
  `Class.Player.Character` spawns for the first time, all of the contents of
  `Class.StarterGui` are automatically copied into the player's
  `Class.PlayerGui`. Note that if `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is set to
  `false`, the character will not spawn and `Class.StarterGui` contents will not
  be copied until `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()` is called. If
  `Class.StarterGui.ResetPlayerGuiOnSpawn` is set to `true`, then every time the
  player's character respawns, all of the contents of that player's
  `Class.PlayerGui` are cleared and replaced with the contents of
  `Class.StarterGui`.

  If you need to control a player's UI container during playtime, for example to
  show/hide a specific `Class.ScreenGui` or any of its children, access it as
  follows from a `Class.LocalScript`:

  ```lua
  local Players = game:GetService("Players")

  local player = Players.LocalPlayer
  local playerGui = player.PlayerGui
  ```

    summary: |
      Sets the transparency of the top bar.
    description: |
      This method sets the transparency of the top bar `Class.CoreGui`. A value
      of `0` is completely opaque and a value of `1` is completely transparent.
      Values outside of the range `[0, 1]` are clamped. The default transparency
      of the topbar is `0.5`.

      Using the `Class.StarterGui:SetCore()` method with the `"TopbarEnabled"`
      option allows you to enable/disable the entire topbar and all of its
      features (player list, health, etc). By contrast, this method only affects
      how the top bar is displayed.
