  A container for a Player's currently rendered ScreenGuis.
description: |
  The PlayerGui object is a container that holds a player's user GUI. If a
  `Class.ScreenGui` is a descendant of a PlayerGui, then any `Class.GuiObject`
  inside of the ScreenGui will be drawn to the player's screen. Any
  `Class.LocalScript` will run as soon as it is inserted into a PlayerGui.

  When a player first joins a game, their PlayerGui is automatically inserted
  into their `Class.Player` object. When the player's `Class.Player.Character`
  spawns for the first time all of the contents of `Class.StarterGui` are
  automatically copied into the player's PlayerGui. Note that if
  `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is set to false the character will not
  spawn and StarterGui contents will not be copied until
  `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()` is called. If
  `Class.StarterGui.ResetPlayerGuiOnSpawn` is set to true then every time the
  player's character respawns all of the contents of that player's PlayerGui is
  cleared and replaced with the contents of StarterGui.

    summary: |
      Sets the transparency of the Topbar CoreGui.
    description: |
      SetTopbarTransparency sets the transparency of the Topbar CoreGui. A value
      of 0 is completely opaque, and a value of 1 is completely transparent.
      Values outside of the range [0, 1] are clamped. The default transparency
      of the topbar is 0.5. The current transparency can be retrieved using the
      similarly-named
      `Class.PlayerGui:GetTopbarTransparency()|GetTopbarTransparency` function.

      #### Comparison of Values

      The screenshots below show the topbar at 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0 transparency.
      <img src="../../../assets/legacy/Topbar_Transparency_1.0.png" alt="The TopBar with a transparency of 1.0 (completely hidden)]"  />
      <img src="../../../assets/legacy/Topbar_Transparency_0.5.png" alt="The TopBar with a transparency of 0.5 (50% transparency)]"  />
      <img src="../../../assets/legacy/Topbar_Transparency_0.png" alt="The TopBar with a transparency of 0.0 (completely opaque)"  />

      #### Usage

      This method is often used when re-styling the topbar to match the visual
      aesthetic of a game. By hiding the topbar, you can create your own custom
      topbar. See the code samples for an example.

      #### Alternative

      Using the `Class.StarterGui:SetCore()` method with the `TopbarEnabled`
      option allows you to enable/disable the entire topbar and all of its
      features (player list, health, etc). By contrast, this method only affects
      how the topbar is displayed.
