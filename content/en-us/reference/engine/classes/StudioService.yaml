  Provides access to configuration of Roblox Studio and allows importing files
  from the user's file system.
description: |
  **StudioService** provides access to configuration of Roblox Studio, allows
  importing files from the user's file system, and other miscellaneous
  information. It is intended to be used by `Class.Plugin|Plugins` in order to
  provide a consistent user experience.

  - Plugins that allow the user to move objects may find
    `Class.StudioService.GridSize|GridSize`,
    `Class.StudioService.RotateIncrement|RotateIncrement` and
    `Class.StudioService.UseLocalSpace|UseLocalSpace` useful.
  - Plugins that require the user to import files should use
    `Class.StudioService:PromptImportFileAsync()|PromptImportFileAsync` or
    `Class.StudioService:PromptImportFilesAsync()|PromptImportFilesAsync` in
    order to receive `Class.File` objects.
  - Plugins that display icons of Instance classes can use
    `Class.StudioService:GetClassIcon()|GetClassIcon`.
  - Plugins that care about which script is currently being edited (if any) can
    read this from `Class.StudioService.ActiveScript|ActiveScript`.

    description: |
      **ActiveScript** refers to the `Class.LuaSourceContainer` currently being
      edited by the user. If the user is not editing a script, this will be
      `nil`. Below is an example that shows how you can use this property to
      measure for how long a script was active.

      ```lua
      local StudioService = game:GetService("StudioService")

      local startTime = os.time()
      local activeScript
      local function onActiveScriptChanged()
        local newActiveScript = StudioService.ActiveScript

      	if activeScript and newActiveScript ~= activeScript then
      		local deltaTime = os.time() - startTime
      		print(("You edited %s for %d:%2.d"):format(activeScript.Name, deltaTime // 60, deltaTime % 60))
      	end
      	startTime = os.time()
      	activeScript = newActiveScript
      end

      StudioService:GetPropertyChangedSignal("ActiveScript"):Connect(onActiveScriptChanged)
      ```

      The **StudioLocaleId** property contains the locale currently in-use by
      Studio, e.g. `en_US`. It is useful when localizing plugins.

      Below is a trivial example of localization based on the value returned by
      this function.

      ```lua
      local locale = game:GetService("StudioService").StudioLocaleId
      if locale == "en_US" then
      	print("Howdy, ya'll")
      elseif locale == "en_GB" then
      	print("'Ello, gov'na")
      elseif locale:sub(1, 2) == "en" then
      	print("Hello")
      elseif locale == "fr_FR" then
      	print("Bonjour")
      end

      with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>L</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>. Plugins can
      read from this property if they implement their own object movement tools.

      **GetClassIcon** provides a dictionary that allows the display of a class'
      Explorer window icon, e.g. calling this function with "Part" returns
      property values that display the part icon from the Explorer window.

      Below is a literal table representation of the value returned when this
      function is called with `"Part"`.

      ```
      {
      	Image = "rbxasset://textures/ClassImages.png",
      	ImageRectOffset = Vector2.new(16, 0),
      	ImageRectSize = Vector2.new(16, 16)
      }
      ```

      The utility function below may prove useful when displaying class icons:

      ```lua
      local StudioService = game:GetService("StudioService")
      local imageLabel = script.Parent
      local function displayClassIcon(image, className)
      	for k, v in StudioService:GetClassIcon(className) do
