      When set to `true`, all scene updates will be given an unlimited budget,
      regardless of how computationally expensive it may be. This ensures each
      frame will look as it should, at the cost of a more unstable frame rate.

    description: |
      Determines the mode for the selection of detail levels for mesh parts. For
      a good balance between performance and fidelity, this should be set to
      `Enum.MeshPartDetailLevel.DistanceBased` (default), which is what the
      client uses.

      Note that the `Class.MeshPart.RenderFidelity` needs to be set to
      `Enum.RenderFidelity.Automatic` for this to work. If you set it to
      `Enum.RenderFidelity.Precise`, you will always see the higher resolution
      version and the `Enum.MeshPartDetailLevel` value will be ignored for that
      `Class.MeshPart`.
