  A spotlight emits light of a specified `Class.Light.Color|Color` and
  `Class.Light.Brightness|Brightness` in the shape of a cone with a spherical
  base. This object is ideal for **directional** light sources like flashlights
  and headlights.

  `Class.SpotLight.Range|Range` controls the distance of illumination and
  `Class.SpotLight.Angle|Angle` defines the angle of light emission from the
  cone's apex as illustrated below.

  A spotlight must be a direct child of a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`
  and will exhibit the following behavior:

  - When the spotlight is parented to a `Class.BasePart`, the
    `Class.SpotLight.Face` property determines the face of the part from which
    light emanates.
  - Although `Class.Attachment|Attachments` don't have faces, the
    `Class.SpotLight.Face` property determines the axis of the attachment from
    which light emanates; **-Z** is front, **+X** is right, **+Y** is top, etc.
