  A `TrussPart` is similar to a `Class.Part` but with a different visual
  `Class.TrussPart.Style|Style` and the important distinction that default
  characters are able to climb it.

  This part type has significantly more restrictive size limitations than other
  parts; it must be `2*2*n` studs where `n` is a multiple of `2` with a maximum
  of `512`.

  Additionally, this part type does not support styling through the addition of
  `Class.Decal|Decals` or `Class.Texture|Textures`. If you wish to create a
  textured and "climbable" `Class.BasePart` but also utilize the climbing
  behavior of `TrussPart`, consider setting the
  `Class.BasePart.Transparency|Transparency` of the `TrussPart` to `1` to make
  it invisible, set `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|CanCollide` on the
  `Class.BasePart` to `false`, and then align the climbable surface of the
  mesh/model with that of the `TrussPart`.
