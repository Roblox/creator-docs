  `Class.AudioListener` records an audio stream from its surrounding
  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` in the 3D world. It provides a single
  **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. If
  the parent is an `Class.Attachment`, `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`,
  the parent's world `Datatype.CFrame` will be used for listening. If the parent
  is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioListener` effectively hears
  nothing.
