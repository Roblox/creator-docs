  `Class.AudioListener` records an audio stream from its surrounding
  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` in the 3D world. It provides a single
  **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. If
  the parent is an `Class.Attachment`, `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`,
  the parent's world `Datatype.CFrame` will be used for listening. If the parent
  is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioListener` effectively hears
  nothing.

      Represents how the perceived volume of the emitted sound changes based on

      This property is internal and can't be accessed by scripts; it exists to

    summary: |
      Sets the angle attenuation curve that the `Class.AudioListener` should
      use, or uses a constant curve of volume `1` if none is provided.
    description: |
      Sets a volume-over-angle curve that affects how loudly a
      `Class.AudioListener` will hear the `Class.AudioEmitter`, based on the
      angle between them and the `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector`
      associated with the `Class.AudioListener`.

      The curve is represented by a table mapping angle keys to volume values.
      Keys are expected to be unique numbers between `0` and `180` (inclusive),
      while values are expected to be numbers between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
      Tables containing up to 400 key-value pairs are supported.

      The volume of a `Class.AudioEmitter` from the perspective of the
      `Class.AudioListener` at an angle `a` is determined by linearly
      interpolating between the volume levels for the points on the curve whose
      angle values are directly above and below `a`. If there is either no point
      below `a` or no point above `a`, the volume level of the other point is
      chosen. Essentially, the curve is a sequence of points connected by
      straight lines, and beyond its left and right endpoints the curve extends
      outward at their respective volume levels.

      This volume will be multiplied with the volumes from all other attenuation
      curves (including the ones on the sending `Class.AudioEmitter`) to obtain
      the final audibility.

      If the table is empty or `nil`, the `Class.AudioEmitter` defaults to using
      an angle attenuation curve with the constant volume value of `1`.

      Sets a volume-over-distance curve that affects how loudly the

      The volume of a `Class.AudioEmitter` from the perspective of the
      `Class.AudioListener` at a distance `d` is determined by linearly
      interpolating between the volume levels for the points on the curve whose
      distance values are directly above and below `d`. If there is either no
      point below `d` or no point above `d`, the volume level of the other point
      is chosen. Essentially, the curve is a sequence of points connected by
      straight lines, and beyond its left and right endpoints the curve extends
      outward infinitely at their respective volume levels.

      This volume will be multiplied with the volumes from all other attenuation
      curves (including the ones on the sending `Class.AudioEmitter`) to obtain
      the final audibility.

      If the table is empty or `nil`, the `Class.AudioListener` defaults to
      applying a constant volume of 1 everywhere.
