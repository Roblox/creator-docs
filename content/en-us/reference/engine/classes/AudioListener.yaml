  `Class.AudioListener` records an audio stream from its surrounding
  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` in the 3D world. It provides a single
  **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. If
  the parent is an `Class.Attachment`, `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`,
  the parent's world `Datatype.CFrame` will be used for listening. If the parent
  is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioListener` effectively hears
  nothing.

      Represents a volume-over-distance curve that affects how loudly the

      This property is internal and can't be accessed by scripts; it exists to
      support replication. See

      Returns a table mapping distance to volume. Keys are numbers greater than
      or equal to 0, while values are numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
      describing how volume attenuates over distance. This method returns an
      empty table if the default distance attenuation curve is being used.

    summary: |
      Sets the distance attenuation curve that the `Class.AudioListener` should
      use, or uses an inverse rolloff curve if none is provided.
    description: |
      Sets a volume-over-distance curve that affects how loudly the
      `Class.AudioListener` will hear any `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters`,
      based on the distance between them.

      The curve is represented by a table mapping distance keys to volume
      values. Keys are expected to be unique numbers greater than or equal to 0,
      while values are expected to be numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
      Tables containing up to 400 key-value pairs are supported.

      The volume of a `Class.AudioEmitter` from the perspective of the
      `Class.AudioListener` at a distance `d` is determined by linearly
      interpolating between the volume levels for the points on the curve whose
      distance values are directly above and below `d`. If there is either no
      point below `d` or no point above `d`, the volume level of the other point
      is chosen. Essentially, the curve is a sequence of points connected by
      straight lines, and beyond its left and right endpoints the curve extends
      outward infinitely at their respective volume levels.

      This volume will be multiplied with the volume from the
      `Class.AudioEmitter.DistanceAttenuation` curve of the `Class.AudioEmitter`
      to obtain the final audibility.

      If the table is empty or `nil`, the `Class.AudioListener` defaults to
      applying a constant volume of 1 everywhere.
