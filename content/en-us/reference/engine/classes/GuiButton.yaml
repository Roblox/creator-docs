name: GuiButton
type: class
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  An abstract class for interactive 2D user interface elements.
description: |
  `Class.GuiButton` is an abstract class that inherits from `Class.GuiObject`.
  It is the base class for the interactive, clickable `Class.ImageButton` and
  `Class.TextButton` objects. This class also defines several properties for
  interactive behavior, namely `Class.GuiButton.AutoButtonColor|AutoButtonColor`
  and `Class.GuiButton.Modal|Modal`.

  The most important event of a `Class.GuiButton` is
  `Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated`, a **multi-platform event** that fires
  when the button is activated. When using a mouse, this means clicking the
  button and releasing with the cursor still over the UI object. For touch, the
  same applies but with a touch instead of button press. Finally, for gamepads,
  `Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated` fires if a `Class.GuiButton` is selected
  when the **A** button is pressed and released. In short, this event is very
  useful for multi-platform user interface programming as it provides a nice
  general interface for a single user input.

    summary: |
      Determines whether the button automatically changes color when the mouse
      hovers over or clicks on it.
    description: |
      This property determines whether the button automatically changes color
      when the user's `Class.Mouse` hovers over or clicks on it. If `true`, the
      button will automatically change color when the mouse hovers over or
      clicks on it. If `false`, the button will not change.

      If you would like to customize how a button changes when the user's mouse
      hovers over or clicks on it, consider using an `Class.ImageButton` and
      changing the element's `Class.ImageButton.HoverImage|HoverImage` and
      `Class.ImageButton.PressedImage|PressedImage`.

      Please note that this property will not have an effect on an
      `Class.ImageButton` if its `Class.ImageButton.Image|Image` property is set
      to an image. Additionally, this property will not affect an
      `Class.ImageButton` on mouse hover when its
      `Class.ImageButton.HoverImage|HoverImage` is not `nil`, nor on mouse click
      if its `Class.ImageButton.PressedImage|PressedImage` is not `nil`.

      In regards to clicking, the mouse must be in bounds of the

      before this event fires. If the mouse leaves the bounds of the
      `Class.GuiButton` and is released, the event will not fire. If you would
      like to avoid this limitation, you can use
      `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton1Down|MouseButton1Down` and
      `Class.GuiButton.MouseButton1Up|MouseButton1Up`; these events are similar
      but will fire whenever the user presses their left mouse button down or
      up, respectively.
