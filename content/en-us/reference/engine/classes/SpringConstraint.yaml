name: SpringConstraint
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  Simulates spring and damper behavior between two attachments.
description: |
  A **SpringConstraint** applies a force to its `Class.Attachment|Attachments`
  based on spring and damper behavior. This constraint, along with a
  `Class.CylindricalConstraint`, is ideal for building vehicle suspension.

  Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**)
  that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not
  be locally simulated when interacting with a player.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Free Length

  `Class.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength` defines the natural resting
  length of the spring. If the attachments are further apart than the free
  length, they are forced together; if the attachments are closer together than
  the free length, they are forced apart.

  #### Damping

  The `Class.SpringConstraint.Damping|Damping` value controls how fast the
  spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to oscillate
  endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more quickly.

  #### Stiffness

  `Class.SpringConstraint.Stiffness|Stiffness` sets the strength of the spring.
  Higher values create a spring that responds with more force when its
  attachments are closer together or further apart than
  `Class.SpringConstraint.FreeLength|FreeLength`.

  #### Limits

  Enabling the `Class.SpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property
  exposes the `Class.SpringConstraint.MinLength|MinLength` and
  `Class.SpringConstraint.MaxLength|MaxLength` values for setting the minimum
  and maximum length of the spring. If the spring's attachments reach these
  limits, they stop moving apart from one another without restitution.

      Sets whether the `Class.SpringConstraint` enforces a minimum and maximum
      length. If the constraint's `Class.Attachment|Attachments` reach these
      limits, they will simply stop moving apart from one another without
      restitution. If you need restitution or elasticity at the ends of the
      range of motion, you can combine a `Class.SpringConstraint` with another
      constraint that allows restitution at the end of its range, such as a
      `Class.PrismaticConstraint` or `Class.RopeConstraint`.

      The maximum force the `Class.SpringConstraint` can apply on its
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments`. Some spring systems can give rise to
      forces that grow fast leading to instability. In such cases it is
      recommended to set MaxForce to a reasonable value.
