name: TweenService
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Used to create `Class.Tween|Tweens` which interpolate, or tween, the
  properties of instances.
description: |
  `Class.TweenService` is used to create `Class.Tween|Tweens` which interpolate,
  or tween, the properties of instances. `Class.Tween|Tweens` can be used on any
  object with compatible property types, including:

  - [number](../../../luau/numbers.md)
  - [boolean](../../../luau/booleans.md)
  - `Datatype.CFrame`
  - `Datatype.Rect`
  - `Datatype.Color3`
  - `Datatype.UDim`
  - `Datatype.UDim2`
  - `Datatype.Vector2`
  - `Datatype.Vector2int16`
  - `Datatype.Vector3`
  - `Datatype.EnumItem`

  `Class.TweenService:Create()`, the primary constructor function, takes
  `Datatype.TweenInfo` specifications about the tween and generates the
  `Class.Tween` object which can then be used to play the tween.

  Note that `Class.Tween|Tweens` can interpolate multiple properties at the same
  time, but they must not be interpolating the same property. If two tweens
  attempt to modify the same property, the initial tween will be cancelled and
  overwritten by the most recent tween.

    summary: |
      Creates a new `Class.Tween` given the object whose properties are to be
      tweened, a `Datatype.TweenInfo`, and a dictionary of goal property values.
    description: |
      This constructor creates a new `Class.Tween` from three arguments: the
      object to tween, the `Datatype.TweenInfo` specifications, and a table
      containing the properties to tween and values to tween to.

      The `propertyTable` parameter needs to be a dictionary where the keys are
      the string names of the property (for example `Position`, `Transparency`,
      or `Color`), and the values are the property targets at the end of the
      tween.

      The `Class.Tween` created using this function is unique to the object
      given as the `instance` parameter. To apply the same tween to another
      object, call this function again with the new object.

        default:
        summary: |
          A dictionary of properties, and their target values, to be tweened.

    description: |
      Returns a new alpha value for interpolating using the given alpha value,

      will be clamped between `0` and `1`.

        default:

        default:
        summary: |
          The easing direction to use.
    returns:
      - type: float
        summary: |
          A new alpha value generated from the given easing style and direction.

    summary: |
      Smoothly interpolates a value towards a target, simulating a critically
      damped spring.
    description: |
      Smoothly interpolates a value towards a target, simulating a critically
      damped spring. Returns a tuple with `(newValue, newVelocity`).
      `newVelocity` needs to be fed to the next call of SmoothDamp to ensure
      smooth results. Supports `Datatype.number`, `Datatype.Vector2`,
      `Datatype.Vector3`, and `Datatype.CFrame`.
    code_samples: []
    parameters:
      - name: current
        type: Variant
        default:
        summary: |
          The current value to smooth.
      - name: target
        type: Variant
        default:
        summary: |
          The target value to reach.
      - name: velocity
        type: Variant
        default:
        summary: |
          The current velocity with which the current value should approach the
          target value. You shouldn't modify this value between calls yourself,
          it's used to store the stateful velocity. In most cases, initialize
          this with `0`, `Vector2.zero`, `Vector3.zero`, or `CFrame.identity`
          depending on the type, or if needed, with your initial velocity.
      - name: smoothTime
        type: float
        default:
        summary: |
          The duration over which the total smoothing operation should take
          place. Note that since this is a damped spring, there's no guarantee
          `current` will be exactly `target` after this time, but it will be
          close. Smaller values result in quicker smoothing.
      - name: maxSpeed
        type: float?
        default:
        summary: |
          The maximum speed at which the current value should approach the
          target value. Leaving this nil defaults to `math.huge`, meaning the
          velocity isn't clamped.
      - name: dt
        type: float?
        default:
        summary: |
          The rate at which the smoothing operation should be applied. If left
          nil, the current engine delta time will be used.
    returns:
      - type: Tuple
        summary: |
          The new value and new velocity calculated from the smoothing
          operation.
