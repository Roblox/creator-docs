  Adds delayed repetitions of a sound with diminishing volume.
description: |
  An echo effect causes a sound to repeat on a delay with diminishing volume,
  simulating the real effect of an echo. This effect can be applied to either an
  individual sound or to a sound group by parenting it to the desired instance.

  The effect is controlled by several properties. First, the Delay is how long
  the effect will wait to play the echoed sound. Feedback determines how much
  the original signal is diminished to play as the echoed sound. Note that this
  echoed sound also goes through the echo effect which will wait another delay
  and play another echo. This process will repeat until the volume of the echoed
  sound is negligible.

  You can also adjust the wet/dry mix of the effect. The dry component of the
  sound is the original sound that the effect is being applied to. You can
  adjust the volume of the dry sound by adjusting the DryLevel. The wet sound is
  the echoed effect itself, and its volume can be adjusted with WetLevel.

  It is recommended to only use the EchoSoundEffect with sound groups. If an
  echo effect is applied to a regular Sound, once that sound stops playing the
  echo effect will also be cut off. When applied to a SoundGroup, the echo
  effect will continue playing even if the original source sound has
  stopped.Like all other `Class.SoundEffect`, a EchoSoundEffect can be applied
  either to a `Class.Sound` or `Class.SoundGroup` by being parented to either.

      The amount of time between echoes.
    description: |
      Range: 0.01 to 5 (default 1) The amount of time between echoes. Measured
      in seconds.

      If a EchoSoundEffect is applied to a singular sound instead of a sound
      group, if the sound stops playing before the delay causes an echo, the
      echo will not play. Because of this, it is recommended to apply echo
      effects to SoundGroups and not Sounds.

      Setting this at it's minimum (0) will cause no feedback, meaning the echo
      won't be audible at all. Setting this at the maximum (1) will have no
      decay, meaning the echoed sound will play at the level of the original and
      will not diminish over time.
