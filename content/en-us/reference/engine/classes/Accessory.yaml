name: Accessory
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An item that a Character can wear.
description: |
  The Accessory Instance is the parent Instance of all accessories (regardless
  of their specific accessory type). It typically has a child Handle with a
  child Attachment and a WrapLayer in the case of Layered Clothing.

  The Accessory class is the successor to the legacy Hat system. It's
  cross-compatible with both the legacy R6 character system and the new R15
  character system.

  If you insert an `Class.Attachment` into the Accessory's Handle with the same
  name as an `Class.Attachment` in one of the character's limbs, they connect
  and ignore properties inherited from the `Class.Accoutrement` class.
  Otherwise, the Accessory functions identically to a `Class.Hat`.

  Note: If there are two matching `Attachments`, the resulting `Class.Weld` is a
  child of the Accessory's Handle. This differs from the legacy behavior of Hats
  where the Weld is always a child of the Head of the character.
