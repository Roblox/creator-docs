  Provides functions to load and preview `Class.AnimationClip|AnimationClips`.
  It includes a number of functions that are useful when working with an
  `Class.Animation`.

  The `Class.AnimationClipProvider` replaces the deprecated
  `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider` that was used to download `KeyframeSequences`
  by content ID.

  The AnimationClipProvider has a number of uses.

  - Download the `Class.AnimationClip` associated with an animation content ID
    from the Roblox website, regardless of the underlying type of
    `Class.AnimationClip` (`Class.KeyframeSequence` or `Class.CurveAnimation`).
  - Generate a temporary id to locally preview an animation.
  - Fetch the content IDs of animations owned by a particular user.

      Generates a temporary asset ID from a `Class.AnimationClip` that can be
      used for localized testing of an animation.

      This function performs the same function to
      `Class.AnimationClipProvider:RegisterAnimationClip()|RegisterAnimationClip`
      yet generates an _active://_ URL instead of a hash.

      The ID generated can be used in an `Class.AnimationClip|AnimationClip's`
      `Class.Animation.AnimationId|AnimationId` property for testing.

      The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
      outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
      used online should upload the `Class.AnimationClip` to Roblox.
