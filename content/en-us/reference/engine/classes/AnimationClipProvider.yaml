  Provides functions to load and preview `Class.AnimationClip|AnimationClips`.
  It includes a number of functions that are useful when working with an
  `Class.Animation`.

  The `Class.AnimationClipProvider` replaces the deprecated
  `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider` that was used to download `KeyframeSequences`
  by content ID.

  The AnimationClipProvider has a number of uses.

  - Download the `Class.AnimationClip` associated with an animation content ID
    from the Roblox website, regardless of the underlying type of
    `Class.AnimationClip` (`Class.KeyframeSequence` or `Class.CurveAnimation`).
  - Generate a temporary ID to locally preview an animation.
  - Fetch the content IDs of animations owned by a particular user.

      Fetches an `Class.AnimationClip` based on the specified assetId. The
      assetId must correspond to an animation asset in Roblox. The function will
      yield until the `Class.AnimationClip` is loaded from the website and
      should be wrapped in a `pcall`.

      Generates a temporary asset ID from a `Class.AnimationClip` that can be
      used for localized testing of an animation. This performs the same
      function as
      `Class.AnimationClipProvider:RegisterAnimationClip()|RegisterAnimationClip()`
      but generates an `active://` URL instead of a hash. The generated ID can
      be used as an `Class.Animation.AnimationId|AnimationId` property for
      testing.

      The asset ID generated by this function is temporary and cannot be used
      outside of Studio. Developers wishing to generate an asset ID that can be
      used online should upload the `Class.AnimationClip` to Roblox.
