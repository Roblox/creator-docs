  The WrapTarget object defines a target. A target is the 3D body with only an
  outer surface, or an Outer Cage.

  This target, often an Avatar, is what 3D accessories (using WrapLayer) will be
  applied to, allowing multiple accessories items to naturally layer over the
  source target.

      Defines how much the body mesh can be compressed by clothing.
    description: |
      Defines how much the body mesh can be compressed by clothing. Super tight
      clothing may lead to an intersection between the clothing mesh and body
      mesh. To solve this visual artifact, the deformer can compress the body
      mesh slightly to solve possible intersections.

      Valid range is 0 to 1. A value of 0 will compress the body mesh as much as
      necessary to ensure that the intersections are eliminated (visible body
      parts might look a little bit deformed). A value of 1 will prevent the
      body mesh from being compressed (may lead to visible intersections or
      Z-fighting). A value of 0.9 (default) is a reasonable default that solves
      most of the intersections without introducing any significant body
      deformation.
