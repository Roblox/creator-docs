name: BindableEvent
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object which enables custom events through asynchronous one-way
  communication between scripts on the same side of the client-server boundary.
  Scripts firing a `Class.BindableEvent` do not yield.
description: |
  The **BindableEvent** object enables custom events through asynchronous
  one-way communication between scripts on the same side of the
  [client-server](../../../projects/client-server.md) boundary. When you fire a
  `Class.BindableEvent` through the `Class.BindableEvent:Fire()` method, the
  firing script does **not** yield and the target function receives the passed
  arguments with certain [limitations](#argument-limitations).
  `Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents` create threads of each connected
  function, so even if one firing errors, others continue.

  As an alternative for two-way communication between two scripts on the same
  side of the client-server boundary, consider `Class.BindableFunction`.

  As stated, `Class.BindableEvent|BindableEvents` do not allow for communication
  between the server and clients. If you are looking for this functionality, use
  a `Class.RemoteEvent` as outlined in
  [Remote Events and Callbacks](../../../scripting/events/remote.md).

  See [Bindable events and callbacks](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md) for
  code samples and further details on `Class.BindableEvent`.

  #### Parameter Limitations

  Any type of Roblox object such as an `Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, or
  others can be passed as a parameter when a `Class.BindableEvent` is fired, as
  well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should
  carefully explore the
  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md#argument-limitations).

    description: |
      Fires the `Class.BindableEvent` which in turn fires the
      `Class.BindableEvent.Event|Event` event. This method does not yield, even
      if no script has connected to the event, and even if a connected function
      yields.

      Any type of Roblox object such as an `Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, or
      others can be passed as a parameter to
      `Class.BindableEvent:Fire()|Fire()`, as well as Luau types such as
      numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should carefully explore the
