  The **Players** service contains `Class.Player` objects for presently
  connected clients to a Roblox server. It also contains information about a
  place's configuration. It can fetch information about players not connected to
  the server, such as character appearances, friends, and avatar thumbnail.

      The BubbleChat `Class.Players` property indicates whether or not bubble
      chat is enabled. It is set with the `Class.Players:SetChatStyle()` method
      using the `Enum.ChatStyle` enum.

      When this chat mode is enabled, the game displays chats in the chat user
      interface at the top-left corner of the screen.

      There are two other chat modes, `Class.Players.ClassicChat` and a chat
      mode where both classic and bubble chat are enabled.

      The **CharacterAutoLoads** property indicates whether

      is true.

      If this property is disabled (false), player `Class.Character|Characters`
      will not spawn until the `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()` function is called
      for each `Class.Player`, including when players join the experience.

      This can be useful in experiences where players have finite lives, such as
      competitive games in which players do not respawn until a game round ends.

      **LocalPlayer** is a read-only property which refers to the `Class.Player`
      whose client is running the experience.

      This property is only defined for `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` and
      `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` required by them, since they run on the
      client. For the server, on which `Class.Script` objects run their code,
      this property is `nil`.

      #### Loading GUIs

      When creating loading GUIs using `Class.ReplicatedFirst`, sometimes a
      `Class.LocalScript` can run before the LocalPlayer is available. In this
      case, you should yield until it becomes available by using
      `Class.Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal()`

      The **RespawnTime** property controls the time, in seconds, it takes for a
      player to respawn when `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is true. It
      defaults to 5.0 seconds.

      This is useful when you want to change how long it takes to respawn based
      on the type of your experience but don't want to handle spawning players
      individually.

      Although this property can be set from within a `Class.Script`, you can
      more easily set it directly on the **Players** object in Studio's
      [Explorer](../../../studio/explorer.md) window.

      This function searches each `Class.Player|player` in `Class.Players` for
      one whose `Class.Player.UserId` matches the given UserId. If such a player
      does not exist, it simply returns `nil`. It is equivalent to the following
      function:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local function getPlayerByUserId(userId)
      	for _, player in Players:GetPlayers() do
      		if player.UserId == userId then
      			return player
      		end
      	end
      end
      ```

      This method is useful in finding the purchaser of a developer product
      using `Class.MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt`, which provides a table
      that includes the purchaser's UserId and not a reference to the Player
      object itself. Most games will require a reference to the player in order
      to grant products.

    description: |
      This function returns the `Class.Player` associated with the given
      `Class.Player.Character`, or `nil` if one cannot be found. It is
      equivalent to the following function:

      ```lua
      local function getPlayerFromCharacter(character)

      		if player.Character == character then
      			return player
      		end
      	end
      end
      ```

      This method is often used when some event in player's character fires
      (such as their `Class.Humanoid` `Class.Humanoid.Died|dying`). Such an
      event might not directly reference the Player object, but this method
      provides easy access. The inverse of this function can be described as
      getting the Character of a Player. To do this, simply access the Character
      property.

      This method returns a table of all presently connected `Class.Player`. It

      only returns Player objects. It functions similarly to
      `Class.Instance:GetChildren()` when called on `Class.Players`. When used
      in conjunction with a for-loop, it is useful for iterating over all
      players in a game.

      ```lua
      Players = game:GetService("Players")
      for i, player in Players:GetPlayers() do
          print(player.Name)
      end
      ```

      Scripts that connect to `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` are often trying to
      process every Player that connects to the game. This method is useful for
      iterating over already-connected players that wouldn't fire
      `Class.Players.PlayerAdded|PlayerAdded`. Using this method ensures that no
      player is missed!

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      local function onPlayerAdded(player)
      	print("Player: " .. player.Name)

      #### Assets sub-table

      The assets table is an array of tables containing the following keys that
      describe the assets currently equipped by the player:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Type</th>
      			<th>Description</th>

          <td>string</td>
          <td>The name of the equipped asset</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      #### Scales sub-table

      The scales table has the following keys, each a number corresponding to
      one `Class.Humanoid` scaling property: `bodyType`, `head`, `height`,
      `proportion`, `depth`, `width`.``

      #### Body Colors sub-table

      The body colors table has the following keys, each a number corresponding
      to a `Datatype.BrickColor` ID number which can be used with
      `Datatype.BrickColor.new(id)`: `leftArmColorId`, `torsoColorId`,
      `rightArmColorId`, `headColorId`, `leftLegColorId`, `rightLegColorId`.

      The GetNameFromUserIdAsync `Class.Players` function will send a query to
      the Roblox website asking what the username is of the account with the
      given `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`.

      This method errors if no account exists with the given UserId. If you

events:
  - name: Players.PlayerAdded
    summary: |
      Fires when a player enters the game.
    description: |
      The PlayerAdded event fires when a player enters the game. This is used to
      fire an event when a player joins a game, such as loading the player's
      saved `Class.GlobalDataStore` data.

      This can be used alongside the `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving` event, which
      fires when a player is about to leave the game. For instance, if you would
      like print a message every time a new player joins or leaves the game:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
      	print(player.Name .. " joined the game!")
      end)

      Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)
      	print(player.Name .. " left the game!")
      end)
      ```

      If you want to track when a player's character is added or removed from
      the game, such as when a player respawns or dies, you can use the
      `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` and `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving`
      functions.

      - Up until recently, this event didn't work on the client (in
        `Localscript`s), but this has been changed

      - This event does not work as expected in _solo mode_, because the player
        is created before scripts that connect to PlayerAdded run. To handle
        this case, as well as cases in which the script is added into the game
        after a player enters, create an OnPlayerAdded function that you can
        call to handle a player's entrance.

    description: |
      This event fires when the game server recognizes that a player's
      membership has changed. Note, however, that the server will only attempt
      to check and update the membership **after** the Premium modal has been
      closed. Thus, to account for cases where the user purchases Premium
      **outside** of the game while playing, you must still prompt them to
      purchase Premium; this will then show a message telling them they're
      already upgraded and, once they close the modal, the game server will
      update their membership and trigger this event.

  - name: Players.PlayerRemoving
    summary: |
      Fires when a player is about to leave the game.
    description: |
      The PlayerRemoving event fires right before a `Class.Player` leaves the
      game. This event fires before `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved|ChildRemoved`
      does on `Class.Players`, and behaves somewhat similarly to
      `Class.Instance.DescendantRemoving`. Since it fires before the actual
      removal of a `Class.Player`, this event is useful for storing player data
      using a `Class.GlobalDataStore`.

      This can be used alongside the `Class.Player.PlayerAdded` event, which
      fires when a player joins the game. For instance, to print a message every
      time a new player joins or leaves the game:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
        print(player.Name .. " joined the game!")
      end)

      Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)
        print(player.Name .. " left the game!")
      end)
      ```

      If you want to track when a player's character is added or removed from
      the game, such as when a player respawns or dies, you can use the

      This event fires when the game server recognizes that the user's status

      them to purchase the subscription; the prompt shows a message telling the
