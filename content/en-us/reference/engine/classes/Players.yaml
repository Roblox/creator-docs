  A service that contains presently connected `Class.Player` objects.
description: |
  The `Class.Players` service contains `Class.Player` objects for presently
  connected clients to a Roblox server. It also contains information about a
  place's configuration. It can fetch information about players not connected to
  the server, such as character appearances, connections, and avatar thumbnail.

      individually.

      more easily set it directly on the `Class.Players` object in Studio's
      [Explorer](../../../studio/explorer.md) window.

    summary: |
      Bans users from your experience, with options to specify duration, reason,
      whether the ban applies to the entire universe or just the current place,
      and more. This method is enabled and disabled by the
      `Class.Players.BanningEnabled` property, which you can toggle in Studio.
    description: |
      The `Class.Players:BanAsync()` method allows you to easily ban users who
      violate your experience's guidelines. You can specify the ban duration,
      enable the ban to propagate to suspected alternate accounts, and provide a
      message to the banned user in accordance with the
      [Usage Guidelines](../../../players/index.md#banning-users). You should
      also post your experience rules somewhere accessible to all users and
      provide a way for them to appeal. This method is enabled and disabled by
      the `Class.Players.BanningEnabled` property, which you can toggle in
      Studio.

      ##### Banning and Messaging

      Banned users will be immediately evicted and prevented from rejoining your
      experiences. They will be presented with an error modal displaying the
      time left on their ban and your `DisplayReason`. Roblox's backend systems
      will evict players across all servers from the place(s) that you specify.
      `DisplayReason` can have a maximum length of 400 characters and is subject
      to a text filter. For more information on acceptable modal text, see
      [ban messaging](../../../players/index.md#message-guidelines).

      ##### Places and Universe

      By default, bans extend to any place within that universe. To limit the
      ban to only the place from which this API is called, configure
      `ApplyToUniverse` to `false`. However, if a user is banned in the start
      place of the universe, it effectively results in the user being excluded
      from the entirety of the universe, irrespective of whether a universal ban
      is in place or not.

      ##### Alternative Accounts

      Users often play under multiple different accounts, known as alternate
      accounts or alt accounts, which are sometimes used to circumvent account
      bans. To help you keep banned users out, the default behavior of this API
      will propagate all bans from the source account you banned to any of their
      suspected alt accounts. You can turn off ban propagations to alt accounts
      by configuring `ExcludeAltAccounts` to `true`.

      ##### Ban Duration

      Not all transgressions are the same, so not all bans should be the same
      length. This API lets you configure the duration of the ban, in seconds,
      with the `Duration` field. To specify a permanent ban, set the field to
      `-1`. You may also want to dynamically configure the ban duration based on
      the user's ban history, which you can query for using
      `Class.Players:GetBanHistoryAsync()`. For example, you may want to
      consider the number of bans, the duration of previous bans, or build logic
      off of the notes you save under `PrivateReason` which can be up to 1000
      characters and are not text filtered. `PrivateReason` notes are never
      shared with the client and can be considered safe from attackers.

      ##### Errors and Throttling

      This method invokes an HTTP call to backend services which are subject to
      throttling and may fail. If you're calling this API with more than one
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`, this method will attempt to make the HTTP
      call for each ID. It will then aggregate any error messages and join them
      as a comma separated list. For example, if this method is invoked for five
      users and requests for those with `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` 2 and 4
      fail, the following error message appears:

      `HTTP failure for UserId 2: Timedout, HTTP 504 (Service unavailable) failure for UserId 4: Service exception`

      The message will always include `failure for UserId {}` if it is an HTTP
      error.

      ##### Client-Side Requirement

      Because of the risks associated with banning users, this method may only
      be called on the backend experience server (client-side calls will result
      in an error). You may test this API in Studio, during
      [collaborative](../../../projects/collaboration.md) creation, or in a
      [team test](../../../studio/testing-modes.md#collaborative-testing), but
      the bans will not apply to production.

      This API uses the
      [User Restrictions Open Cloud API](/cloud/reference/UserRestriction). You
      will be able to utilize these APIs to manage your bans in third party
      applications.

      This function returns a `Class.Model` containing the assets which the
      player is wearing, excluding gear.

      If you prefer a Luau table of information about these assets instead of a
      model, use `Class.Players:GetCharacterAppearanceInfoAsync()`.

      This method behaves similar to `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()`, and is
      like using `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset` on the asset
      information returned by `Class.Players:GetCharacterAppearanceInfoAsync()`
      except faster.

      This function returns information about a player's avatar on the Roblox
      website in the form of a dictionary. It is not to be confused with
      `Class.Players:GetCharacterAppearanceAsync()|GetCharacterAppearanceAsync`,
      which actually loads the assets described by this method. You can use
      `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()` to load the assets that are used in the
      player's avatar. The structure of the returned dictionary is as follows:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Type</th>
      			<th>Description</th>

          <td>Describes various body scaling factors</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      ##### Assets Sub-Table

      The `assets` table is an array of tables containing the following keys
      that describe the assets currently equipped by the player:

      <table>
      	<thead>
      		<tr>
      			<th>Name</th>
      			<th>Type</th>
      			<th>Description</th>

      	</thead>
      	<tr>
          <td><code>id</code></td>
          <td>number</td>
          <td>The asset ID of the equipped asset</td>
        </tr>
      	<tr>
          <td><code>assetType</code></td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>A table with <code>name</code> and <code>id</code> fields, each describing the kind of asset equipped ("Hat", "Face", etc.)</td>
        </tr>
      	<tr>
          <td><code>name</code></td>
          <td>string</td>
          <td>The name of the equipped asset</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      ##### Scales Sub-Table

      The `scales` table has the following keys, each a number corresponding to
      one `Class.Humanoid` scaling property: `bodyType`, `head`, `height`,
      `proportion`, `depth`, `width`.

      ##### Body Colors Sub-Table

      The `bodyColors` table has the following keys, each a number corresponding
      to a `Datatype.BrickColor` ID number which can be used with
      `Datatype.BrickColor.new(id)`: `leftArmColorId`, `torsoColorId`,
      `rightArmColorId`, `headColorId`, `leftLegColorId`, `rightLegColorId`.

      The GetNameFromUserIdAsync `Class.Players` function will send a query to

      This method errors if no account exists with the given UserId. If you
      aren't certain such an account exists, it's recommended to wrap calls to
      this function with `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()`. In addition, you can

      This function searches each `Class.Player` in `Class.Players` for one

      This method is useful in finding the purchaser of a developer product
      using `Class.MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt` which provides a table
      that includes the purchaser's `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` and not a
      reference to the `Class.Player` object itself. Most experiences will
      require a reference to the player in order to grant products.

    description: |
      This function returns the `Class.Player` associated with the given
      `Class.Player.Character`, or `nil` if one cannot be found. It is
      equivalent to the following function:

      ```lua
      local function getPlayerFromCharacter(character)
      	for _, player in game:GetService("Players"):GetPlayers() do
      		if player.Character == character then
      			return player
      		end
      	end
      end
      ```

      This method is often used when some event in player's character fires
      (such as their `Class.Humanoid` `Class.Humanoid.Died|dying`). Such an
      event might not directly reference the Player object, but this method
      provides easy access. The inverse of this function can be described as
      getting the Character of a Player. To do this, simply access the Character
      property.

      except that it only returns `Class.Player` objects found under
      `Class.Players`. When used with a `for` loop, it is useful for iterating
      over all players in an experience.

      useful for iterating over already-connected players that wouldn't fire
      `Class.Players.PlayerAdded|PlayerAdded`. Using this method ensures that no
      player is missed!

      ```lua

    summary: |
      Unbans players banned from `Class.Players:BanAsync()` or the User
      Restrictions Open Cloud API. This method is enabled and disabled by the
      `Class.Players.BanningEnabled` property, which you can toggle in Studio.
    description: |
      Unbans players banned from `Class.Players:BanAsync()` or the
      [User Restrictions Open Cloud API](/cloud/reference/UserRestriction). This
      method is enabled and disabled by the `Class.Players.BanningEnabled`
      property, which you can toggle in Studio.

      Like `Class.Players:BanAsync()`, this method takes in a `config`
      dictionary that will let you bulk unban users. This configures the users
      that are unbanned and the scope from which they are unbanned from.

      Unbans will only take effect on bans with the same `ApplyToUniverse`
      scope. For example, an unban with `ApplyToUniverse` set to `true` will not
      invalidate a previous ban with `ApplyToUniverse` set to `false`. In other
      words, a universe level unban will not invalidate a place level ban. The
      opposite also holds true.

      This method invokes a HTTP call to backend services, which are throttled
      and may fail. If you are calling this API with multiple UserIds, this
      method will attempt to make this HTTP call for each UserId. It will then
      aggregate any error messages and join them as a comma separated list. For
      example, if this method is invoked for five `UserIds`: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
      and requests for users 2 and 4 fail then the following error message
      appears:
      `HTTP failure for UserId 2: Timedout, HTTP 504 (Service unavailable) failure for UserId 4: Service exception.`
      The message will always include `failure for UserId {}` if it is an HTTP
      error. It is undefined behavior if you pass in both valid and invalid
      UserIds, i.e. a `UserId` that is not a positive number, as some network
      requests may succeed before all input is validated.

      Because of the risks associated with banning users, this method may only
      be called on the backend server. Client side calls will result in an
      error. You may test this API in Studio, Team Create, and Team Test, but
      the bans will not apply to production. This function call will only
      attempt ban requests on production servers and not in Studio testing.
      However, all input validation steps will still work in Studio.

      This API uses the
      [User Restrictions Open Cloud API](/cloud/reference/UserRestriction). You
      will be able to utilize these APIs to manage your bans in third party
      applications.

      Fires when a player enters the experience.
    description: |
      This event fires when a player enters the experience, such as loading the
      player's saved `Class.GlobalDataStore` data.

      This can be used alongside the `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving` event, which
      fires when a player is about to leave the experience. For instance, if you
      would like print a message every time a new player joins or leaves:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
      	print(player.Name .. " joined the experience!")
      end)

      Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player, reason)
      	print(player.Name .. " left the experience! Reason: " .. tostring(exitReason))
      end)
      ```

      If you want to track when a player's character is added or removed from
      the experience, such as when a player respawns or dies, you can use the
      `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` and `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving`
      functions.

      Note that this event does not work as expected in a solo playtest mode
      because the player is created before scripts run that connect to
      `Class.Players.PlayerAdded|PlayerAdded`. To handle this case, as well as
      cases in which the script is added into the experience after a player
      enters, create an `onPlayerAdded()` function that you can call to handle a
      player's entrance.

      This event fires when the experience server recognizes that a player's
      membership has changed. Note, however, that the server will only attempt
      to check and update the membership **after** the Premium modal has been
      closed. Thus, to account for cases where the user purchases Premium
      **outside** of the experience while playing, you must still prompt them to
      purchase Premium; this will then show a message telling them they're
      already upgraded and, once they close the modal, the server will update
      their membership and trigger this event.

    summary: |
      Fires when a player is about to leave the experience.
    description: |
      This event fires right before a `Class.Player` leaves the experience,
      before `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved|ChildRemoved` fires on
      `Class.Players`, and behaves somewhat similarly to
      `Class.Instance.DescendantRemoving`. Since it fires before the actual
      removal of a `Class.Player`, this event is useful for storing player data
      using a `Class.GlobalDataStore`.

      This can be used alongside the `Class.Player.PlayerAdded` event, which
      fires when a player joins the experience. For instance, to print a message
      every time a new player joins or leaves:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
      	print(player.Name .. " joined the experience!")
      end)

      Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player, exitReason)
      	print(player.Name .. " left the experience! - Reason: " .. tostring(exitReason))
      end)
      ```

      If you want to track when a player's character is added or removed from

      This event fires when the experience server recognizes that the user's

      you must still prompt them to purchase the subscription; the prompt shows
      a message telling the user they're already subscribed, and after they
