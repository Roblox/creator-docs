name: Flag
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  The Flag object helps you make 'capture the flag' style games.
description: |
  The Flag is a unit spawned with a `Class.FlagStand` object, and will respawn
  when captured. When a player touches this object's Handle, which must be a
  child of the Flag object, which is a Part named "Handle", the flag will be
  added to the player's backpack and will appear in their hand. A player cannot
  select other weapons while carrying a flag, and can drop the flag at anytime
  by pressing "Backspace" on the keyboard. If the player carrying a flag steps
  onto another FlagStand of a different team color, the flag will be removed
  from the player's backpack and a point will be added to the user's
  leaderstats, if provided. The flag will then regenerate at the originating
  flag stand.
