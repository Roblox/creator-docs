  The Selection service controls the `Class.Instance|Instances` that are
  selected in Roblox Studio.

  This service is particularly useful when developing `Class.Plugin|Plugins`, as
  it allows the developer to access and manipulate the current selection.

  Currently selected `Class.Instance|Instances` can be obtained and set using
  the `Class.Selection:Get()` and `Class.Selection:Set()` functions. The
  `Class.Selection.SelectionChanged` event fires whenever the current selection
  changes.

  For more information on using `Class.Selection` and `Class.Plugin|Plugins`,
  see `Class.Plugin`.

  Selection is also often used in the command bar, to set hidden properties or
  run functions for selected `Class.Instance|Instances`.

  Note this class only applies to Roblox Studio and has no applicability to
  games.

      Returns an array of currently selected `Class.Instance|Instances` in
      Roblox Studio.

      If no `Class.Instance|Instances` are selected, the array returned be
      empty. This function can be used in conjunction with the
      `Class.Selection.SelectionChanged` event to get the selection whenever it
      changes.

      Note, this function can only be used in `Class.Plugin|Plugins` or the
      command line.

      For changing the current selection, please see `Class.Selection:Set()`.

      Sets the currently selected objects in Roblox Studio to

      Calling this function will cause the `Class.Selection.SelectionChanged`
      event to fire, unless the new selection set is identical to the previous
      selection.

      Note this function overwrites the existing selection. However, using
      `Class.Selection:Get()` an `Class.Instance` can be added to the existing
      selection like so:

      ```
      local selected = Selection:Get()
      table.insert(selected, object)
      Selection:Set(selected)
      ```

      Fires when the `Class.Instance|Instances` selected in Roblox Studio
      changes.

      Note this event does not give the new selection. Developers will need to
      use the `Class.Selection:Get()` function to obtain the current selection.

      Although this event can be used outside of plugins and the command bar, it
      only applies to the selection in Roblox Studio and therefore has no
      functionality outside of Studio.

      To change the selection use the `Class.Selection:Set()` function.
