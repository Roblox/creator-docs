description: |
  A **RotateV** object joins two parts together and allows rotation about a set
  axis. This object is most commonly created by the `Enum.SurfaceType.Motor` on
  a `Class.BasePart`. If created through a script, behavior is still governed by
  the surface input of `Class.JointInstance.Part0`.

  The three inputs of note are as follows:

  - `NoInput` &mdash; The joint will not rotate under its own power. It can
  still be rotated by external forces (such as from a character pushing one of
  the parts).

  - `Constant` &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the ParamB property of
  `Class.JointInstance.Part0`. This rotation is measured in radians per physics
  frame (which is approximately 1/60th of a second).

  - `Sin` &mdash; The joint will rotate based on the `ParamA` and `ParamB`
  properties of `Class.JointInstance.Part0`.

deprecation_message: |
  This class works alongside the deprecated `Enum.SurfaceType` and should not be
  used for future work; use `Class.HingeConstraint` instead.
