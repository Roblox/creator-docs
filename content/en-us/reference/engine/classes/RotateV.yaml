description: |
  A RotateV object joins two parts together and allows rotation about a set
  axis. This object is most commonly created by the Motor `Enum.SurfaceType`. If
  created through a script, a RotateV's behavior is still governed by the
  SurfaceInput of `Class.JointInstance.Part0`.

  The three inputs of note are as follows:

  - NoInput: The joint will not rotate under its own power. It can still be
    rotated by external forces (such as from a character pushing one of the
    parts).
  - Constant: The joint will rotate based on the ParamB property of
    `Class.JointInstance.Part0`. This rotation is measured in radians per
    physics frame (which is approximately 1/60th of a second).
  - Sin: The joint will rotate based on the ParamA and ParamB properties of
    `Class.JointInstance.Part0`. The rotation measured in radians per physics
    frame is calculated by the function: RotationRate = ParamA _
    sin(distributedGameTime _ ParamB). distributedGameTime is the current time
    of the game measured in seconds.
