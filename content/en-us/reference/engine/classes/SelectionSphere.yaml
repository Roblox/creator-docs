  **SelectionSphere** is an object which renders a 3D sphere around its
  `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee|Adornee` when it is a descendant of the
  `Class.Workspace` or anywhere where GUI objects are rendered. The sphere's
  geometry consists of a ring/outline in addition to a surface. By default, only
  the outline is visible.

  <img src="/assets/legacy/SelectionSphere.jpg" alt="A default SelectionSphere adorned to a semi-transparent default Part"  />
  There are a few properties available to configure the appearance of the
  sphere. The outline can modified through the
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Color3|Color3`&dagger; and
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Transparency|Transparency`&dagger; properties. The surface can
  be modified through the `Class.SelectionSphere.SurfaceColor3|SurfaceColor3` and
  `Class.SelectionSphere.SurfaceTransparency|SurfaceTransparency` properties.
  Finally, rendering of the sphere can be toggled with the
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Visible|Visible`&dagger; property.

  &dagger; These properties come from this object's superclass,
  `Class.GuiBase3d`.

  The SelectionSphere object does not capture any form of input; it is solely a
  visual effect. To capture simple pointer input on the adornee, consider using
  a `Class.ClickDetector`.

      See also:

      - `Class.SelectionSphere.SurfaceTransparency|SurfaceTransparency`, which
        controls the transparency of the surface. You may need to adjust this
        property in order to see changes to SurfaceColor3.
      - `Class.GuiBase3d.Color`, a property of the superclass `Class.GuiBase3d`
        which controls the color of the outline rather than the surface faces

    summary: |
      Determines the transparency of the sphere's surface, similar to
      `Class.BasePart.Transparency`.
    description: |
      **SurfaceTransparency** determines the transparency of the
      SelectionSphere's surface, similar to the way
      `Class.BasePart.Transparency` works. By default, this property is 1, which
      causes the surface to not be visible.

      See also:

      - `Class.SelectionSphere.SurfaceColor3|SurfaceColor3`, which controls the
        color of the surface.
      - `Class.GuiBase3d.Transparency`, a property of the superclass
        `Class.GuiBase3d` which controls the transparency of the outline rather
        than the surface
