  Renders a 3D sphere around its `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`.
description: |
  `SelectionSphere` renders a 3D sphere around its
  `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee|Adornee` when it is a descendant of the
  `Class.Workspace` or anywhere where GUI objects are rendered. The sphere's
  geometry consists of a ring/outline in addition to a surface.
  `SelectionSphere` does not capture any form of input; it is solely a visual
  effect.

  For an outline/fill overlay effect which covers nonâ€‘primitive geometry such as
  that of a `Class.MeshPart`, see `Class.Highlight`.

      This property is deprecated in favor of
      `Class.SelectionSphere.SurfaceColor3|SurfaceColor3` which uses the more
      precise `Datatype.Color3` data type instead of a `Datatype.BrickColor`
      used by this property.

      `SurfaceColor3` determines the color of the sphere's surface.

      See also `Class.SelectionSphere.Color3|Color3`, a property of the
      superclass `Class.GuiBase3d` which controls the color of the outline
      rather than the surface faces.

      Determines the transparency of the sphere's surface.
    description: |
      `SurfaceTransparency` determines the transparency of the sphere's surface,
      similar to the way `Class.BasePart.Transparency` works. By default, this
      property is `1` which causes the surfaces to be invisible.

      See also `Class.SelectionSphere.Transparency|Transparency`, a property of
      the superclass `Class.GuiBase3d` which controls the transparency of the
      outline rather than the surface.
