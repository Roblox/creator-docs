name: Player

memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object that represents a presently connected client to the experience.
description: |
  A `Player` object is a client that is currently connected. These objects are
  added to the `Class.Players` service when a new player connects, then removed
  when they eventually disconnect from the server.

  The `Class.Instance.Name` property reflects the player's username. When saving
  information about a player, you should use their `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`
  since it is possible that a player can change their username.

  There are several similar methods in the `Class.Players` service for working
  with Player objects. Use these over their respective `Class.Instance` methods:

  - You can get a table of current `Player` objects using
    `Class.Players:GetPlayers()`; again, use this instead of
    `Class.Instance:GetChildren()`.
  - To detect the addition of `Player` objects, it is recommended to use the
    `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` event (instead of `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` on
    the `Class.Players` service).
  - Similarly, you can detect the removal of `Player` objects using
    `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`, which fires just **before** the `Player` is
    removed (instead of `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved` which fires after). This
    is important if you are saving information about the player that might be
    removed or cleaned up on removal.

    description: |
      This property determines whether the `Class.Player.Character|Character` of
      a `Class.Player` using a mobile device will automatically jump when they
      hit an obstacle. This can make levels more navigable while on a mobile
      device.

      When the player joins the experience, the
      `Class.StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled` value determines the initial state
      of this property. Then, this property determines the value of the
      `Class.Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled` property of the
      `Class.Player.Character|Character` on spawn. In other words, it is
      possible to set the auto-jump behavior on a per-character, per-player, and
      per-experience basis using these three properties.

    description: |
      This property sets the player's camera mode, defaulting to third person.

      #### Third Person

      In the default third person mode (`Enum.CameraMode.Classic`), the
      character can be seen in the camera. While in this mode, the default
      behavior is:

      - Players can right-click and drag (mouse), tap and drag (mobile), use the
        secondary thumbstick (gamepad), or press the left/right arrows
        (keyboard) to rotate the camera around their character.
      - When a player moves their character, it faces in the corresponding
        movement direction.
      - Players can zoom in and out freely, even to first person on full zoom
        in.

      #### First Person

      In first person mode (`Enum.CameraMode.LockFirstPerson`), the player's
      camera is zoomed all the way in. Unless there is a visible GUI present
      with the `Class.GuiButton.Modal` property set to `true`, moving the mouse,
      tap-dragging on mobile, or using the secondary thumbstick on a gamepad
      will rotate the camera around the character.

      - If `false`, the player will spawn with a default appearance.

      A `Class.Model` controlled by the player that contains a `Class.Humanoid`,
      body parts, scripts, and other objects.
    description: |
      This property contains a reference to a `Class.Model` containing a
      `Class.Humanoid`, body parts, scripts, and other objects required for
      simulating the player's avatar in-experience. The model is parented to the
      `Class.Workspace` but it may be moved. It is automatically loaded when
      `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is `true` and it can be manually loaded
      otherwise using `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()|LoadCharacterAsync()`.

      Initially this property is `nil` and it is set when the player's character
      first spawns. Use the `Class.Player.CharacterAdded|CharacterAdded` event
      to detect when a player's character properly loads, and the
      `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving|CharacterRemoving` event to detect when
      the character is about to despawn. Avoid using
      `Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()` on this property.

      Note that `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` that are cloned from
      `Class.StarterGui` or `Class.StarterPack` into a player's
      `Class.PlayerGui` or `Class.Backpack` respectively are often run before
      the old character model is replaced, so `Class.Player.Character` may refer
      to the old model whose `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` property is `nil`.
      Therefore, in a `Class.LocalScript` under `Class.StarterGui` or
      `Class.StarterPack`, it is advisable to make sure the parent of
      `Character` is not `nil` before using it, for example:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local player = Players.LocalPlayer

      local character = player.Character
      if not character or character.Parent == nil then
      	character = player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
      end
      ```

      appearance is used for a player's `Class.Player.Character|Character`. By
      default, this property is the `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`, which uses the
      player's avatar as they have created it on Roblox.

      Changing this property to the user ID of another account will cause the
      player to spawn with that account's appearance.

      You can also toggle whether or not a player's character appearance is
      loaded in experience by changing the
      `Class.StarterPlayer.LoadCharacterAppearance` property.

      This property was once used by an ancient data persistence method to
      indicate the total amount of data currently being stored in the player's

      #### Notes

      - Booleans and numbers cost 1 data complexity unit.
      - Strings cost their length divided by 100 in data complexity units.
      - Instances cost their DataCost in data complexity units.
      - Saving the default value (0 for numbers, false for booleans, "" for
        strings and `nil` for Instances) removes the key from the DataComplexity
        count.
      - If, when using the SaveBoolean, SaveString, SaveNumber or SaveInstance
        functions, the DataComplexity for the player goes over the limit
        (currently 45000 units, defined by DataComplexityLimit), the function
        throws an error, the value is not saved, and any previous value of the
        key that was being saved to is deleted.

      This property contains the display name of the authenticated user
      associated with the `Class.Player` object. Unlike
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`, display names are non-unique names a player
      displays to others.

      #### Usage Notes

      - Since display names are non-unique, it's possible for two players in a
        single instance to have identical names. If you need a globally unique
        identifier for a player, use `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` instead.

      - Characters generated with
        `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()|LoadCharacterAsync()` or by the
        Roblox engine will have their `Class.Humanoid.DisplayName` property
        assigned to the `Class.Player.DisplayName` property.

      - Display names may have unicode characters in the string. See
        `Library.utf8|UTF-8` for more information on how to work with strings
        with unicode characters.

      Different Roblox systems that communicate over the network (such as
      physics, streaming, etc.) replicate at different rates depending on how
      close objects are to the replication focus.

      When this property is `nil`, it reverts to its default behavior which is
      to treat the local player's character's
      `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart` as the replication focus.

      This property should only be set on the server with a `Class.Script`, not
      a `Class.LocalScript`. Note that this property does not change or update
      network ownership of parts.

      It's often a better idea to set `Class.Player.Team` to the respective

      </table>

      If a server initiates the player's teleport, the dictionary that this
      method returns includes the player's teleport data. The
      `Class.Player:GetJoinData()|GetJoinData()` method can only be used to
      fetch teleport data on the server. To fetch the data on the client, use
      `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`.

      Unlike `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`,
      `Class.Player:GetJoinData()|GetJoinData()` only provides teleport data
      that meets the following security criteria:

      - It's guaranteed to have been sent by a Roblox server in the past 48
        hours.
      - It's guaranteed to have been sent with this `Class.Player`.
      - The `SourcePlaceId` and `SourceGameId` are guaranteed to be the place
        and universe the data was sent from. This means you can verify the
        teleport data came from an approved place.

      As this data is transmitted by the client, it can still potentially be
      abused by an exploiter. Sensitive data such as player currency should be
      transmitted via a secure solution like
      [Memory Stores](../../../cloud-services/memory-stores/index.md).

      Returns the round-trip, isolated network latency of the player in seconds.
      "Ping" is a measurement of the time taken for data to be sent from the
      client to the server, then back again. It doesn't involve data
      deserialization or processing.

      For client-side `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, this function can only
      be called on the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`. This function is useful in
      identifying and debugging issues that occur in high network latency
      scenarios. It's also useful for masking latency, such as adjusting the
      speed of throwing animations for projectiles.

      This call may not yield the most up-to-date information. If a player

      Calling the `LoadCharacterAsync()` method on any `Player` fires events in
      the following order:

      1. The character appearance initializes.
      2. The character rig builds and scales.
      3. The character moves to the spawn location.
      4. `Class.Player.Character` sets, automatically removing old character.
      5. `Class.Object.Changed` fires on the `Class.Player` with a value of
         `Character`.
      6. The character's `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` sets to the
         `Class.DataModel`.
      7. `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` fires.
      8. `Class.Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded` fires.

      The LoadCharacterAppearance `Class.Player` function places the given
      instance either in the player's `Class.Player.Character`, head, or
      `Class.StarterGear` based on the instance's class.

      This is useful when giving a player's character an asset from the Roblox
      catalog, such as a hat or piece of gear.

      It is similar to `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()`, except it does not
      reload the entire character instance, StarterGear, or `Class.PlayerGui`.

      Note:

      - `Class.Accessory`, `Class.Shirt`, `Class.ShirtGraphic`,
        `Class.CharacterMesh`, `Class.BodyColors`, and `Class.Accoutrement` are
        parented to the player's character.
      - `Class.Decal`, `Class.FileMesh`, `Class.SpecialMesh`, `Class.BlockMesh`,
        `Class.CylinderMesh`, and `Class.Texture` are parented to the
        character's head.
      - `Class.Tool` is parented to the player's `Class.StarterGear`.
      - All other classes are ignored.

      For experiences where
      [instance streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md) is enabled, requests
      that the server stream to the player regions (parts and terrain) around
      the specified **X**, **Y**, **Z** location in the 3D world. It is useful
      if the experience knows that the player's `Datatype.CFrame` will be set to
      the specified location in the near future. Without providing the location
      with this call, the player may not have streamed in content for the
      destination, resulting in a streaming pause or other undesirable behavior.

      The effect of this call will be temporary and there are no guarantees of
      what will be streamed in around the specified location. Client memory
      limits and network conditions may impact what will be available on the
      client.

      #### Usage Precaution

      Requesting streaming around an area is **not a guarantee** that the
      content will be present when the request completes, as streaming is
      affected by the client's network bandwidth, memory limitations, and other
      factors.

          Optional timeout for the request, the maximum duration that the engine
          attempts to stream regions around the `position` parameter before
          abandoning the request. If you don't specify a value, the timeout is
          effectively infinite. However, if the client is low on memory, the
          engine abandons all streaming requests, even those that are still
          within the timeout duration.

      Sets whether or not the player sees filtered chats, rather than normal
      chats.
    description: |
      This method sets whether or not the player sees chat filtered by
      `Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()` rather than normal chats.

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      local player = Players.LocalPlayer
      player:SetSuperSafeChat(true)
      ```

      Regardless of whether a player has filtered chat enabled, all chat should
      be filtered by `Class.TextService` when broadcast to other players or on
      the player's own screen. `Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()` returns a
      `Class.TextFilterResult` object that can be filtered differently according
      to the message's intended use.

    summary: |
      Fires when a player's character spawns or respawns.
    description: |
      This event fires when a player's character spawns or respawns. It fires
      soon after setting `Class.Player.Character|Character` to a non-`nil` value
      or calling `Class.Player:LoadCharacterAsync()|LoadCharacterAsync()`, which
      is before the character is parented to the `Class.Workspace`.

      This can be used alongside the
      `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving|CharacterRemoving` event which fires right
      before a player's character is about to be removed, typically after death.
      As such, both of these events can potentially fire many times as players
      die then respawn in a place.

      Note that the `Class.Humanoid` and its default body parts (head, torso,
      and limbs) will exist on the server when this event fires, but clothing
      items like `Class.Hat|Hats`, `Class.Shirt|Shirts`, and `Class.Pants` might
      take a few seconds to be added to the character. The parts will also take
      time to replicate to clients. Connect `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` on the
      added character to detect these, or wait for the
      `Class.Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded|CharacterAppearanceLoaded` event
      to be sure the character has everything equipped.

      If you instead need to track when a player joins/leaves the experience,
      use the events `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` and
      `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`.

    description: |
      This event fires when the full appearance of a
      `Class.Player.Character|Character` has been inserted. It only fires on the
      server.

      A `Class.Player.Character|Character` generally has a range of objects
      modifying its appearance, including `Class.Accoutrement|Accoutrements`,
      `Class.Shirt|Shirts`, `Class.Pants` and
      `Class.CharacterMesh|CharacterMeshes`. This event will fire when all such
      objects have been inserted into the character.

      For custom character implementations, such as using a character model
      named `StarterCharacter` inside `Class.StarterPlayer`, use
      `Class.Player.CharacterAdded|CharacterAdded` and handle your own
      accessories.

      One use for this event is to ensure all accessories have loaded before
      destroying them. See below for an example of this.

      This event fires approximately two minutes after the engine classifies the
      player as idle. Time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since that
      point. The event continues to fire every 30 seconds for as long as the
      player remains idle.

      This event only fires in client scripts, not server scripts; use a
      `Class.RemoteEvent` to notify the server of idle players.

      Roblox automatically disconnects players that have been idle for at least
      20 minutes, so this event is useful for warning players that they will be
      disconnected soon, disconnecting players prior to those 20 minutes, or
      other away from keyboard (AFK) features.

      To track how often automatic disconnects occur, try correlating this event
      with occurrences of `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`.
