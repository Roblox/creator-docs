  An object that represents a presently connected client to the game.
description: |
  A **Player** object is a client that is currently connected. These objects are
  added to the `Class.Players` service when a new player connects, then removed
  when they eventually disconnect from the server.

  The `Class.Instance.Name` property reflects the player's username. When saving
  information about a player, you should use their `Class.Player.UserId` since
  it is possible that a player can change their username.

  There are several similar methods in the `Class.Players` service for working
  with Player objects. Use these over their respective `Class.Instance` methods:

  - You can get a table of current Player objects using
    `Class.Players:GetPlayers()`; again, use this instead of
    `Class.Instance:GetChildren()`.
  - To detect the addition of Player objects, it is recommended to use the
    `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` event (instead of `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` on
    the `Class.Players` service).
  - Similarly, you can detect the removal of Player objects using
    `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`, which fires just **before** the Player is
    removed (instead of `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved` which fires after). This
    is important if you are saving information about the player that might be
    removed or cleaned up on-removal.

      The AccountAge is a `Class.Player` property that describes how long ago a
      player's account was registered in days. It is set using the
      `Class.Player:SetAccountAge()` function, which cannot be accessed by
      scripts.

      This property is useful for conditionally showing new Roblox players
      content such as tutorials.

      automatically jump when they hit an obstacle. This can make levels more
      navigable while on a mobile device.

      When the player joins the game, the `Class.StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled`
      value determines the initial state of this property. Then, this property
      determines the value of the `Class.Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled` property of
      the `Class.Player.Character` on spawn. In other words, it is possible to
      set the auto-jump behavior on a per-character, per-player and per-game
      basis using these three properties.

    description: |
      The **CameraMode** property sets the player's camera mode, defaulting to
      third person.

      #### Third Person

      In the default third person mode (`Enum.CameraMode.Classic`), the
      character can be seen in the camera. While in this mode, the default
      behavior is:

      - Players can right-click and drag (mouse), tap and drag (mobile), use the
        secondary thumbstick (gamepad), or press the left/right arrows
        (keyboard) to rotate the camera around their character.
      - When a player moves their character, it faces in the corresponding
        movement direction.
      - Players can zoom in and out freely, even to first person on full zoom
        in.

      #### First Person

      In first person mode (`Enum.CameraMode.LockFirstPerson`), the player's
      camera is zoomed all the way in. Unless there is a visible GUI present
      with the `Class.GuiButton.Modal` property set to `true`, moving the mouse,
      tap-dragging on mobile, or using the secondary thumbstick on a gamepad
      will rotate the camera around the character.

      If _false_, the player will spawn with a default appearance - a grey
      character model without any hats, shirts, pants, etc.

      Attempting to set the property after the character has spawned will not
      change the character, you must call `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()` to load
      the new appearance.

      A `Class.Model` controlled by the player that contains a `Class.Humanoid`,

    description: |
      The Character property contains a reference to a `Class.Model` containing
      a `Class.Humanoid`, body parts, scripts and other objects required for
      simulating the player's avatar in-game. The model is parented to the
      `Class.Workspace`, but may be moved. It is automatically loaded when
      `Class.Players.CharacterAutoLoads` is true, but can be manually loaded
      otherwise using `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()`.

      Initially, this property is nil then set when the player's character first
      spawns. Use the `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` event to detect when a
      player's character properly loads, and the
      `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving` event to detect when the character is
      about to despawn. Avoid using `Class.Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal()`
      on this property.

      Note: LocalScripts that are cloned from `Class.StarterGui` or
      `Class.StarterPack` into a player's `Class.Backpack` or `Class.PlayerGui`
      are often run before the old Character model is deleted. Player.Character
      still refers to a model, but that model's parent is nil and it has been
      destroyed. Because of this, if the Character already exists, you should
      check to make sure that the Character's parent is not nil before using it.

      So if you're writing a `Class.LocalScript` under the `Class.StarterGui` or
      `Class.StarterPack` that requires access to the player's character, use
      this:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local player = Players.LocalPlayer
      local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
      ```

        functions, the DataComplexity for the player goes over the limit
        (currently 45000 units, defined by DataComplexityLimit), the function

      over the network (such as physics, streaming, etc) replicate at different
      rates depending on how close objects are to the replication focus.

      When this property is nil, it reverts to its default behavior which is to
      treat the local player's character's `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart`
      as the replication focus.

      This property should only be set on the server with a `Class.Script`, not

      If set, the player will respawn at the given `Class.SpawnLocation`. This
      property can only be set through Lua and must contain a reference to a
      valid `Class.SpawnLocation`, which must meet the following criteria:

      - Descendant of `Class.Workspace`
      - `Class.SpawnLocation.TeamColor` is set to the `Class.Player.TeamColor`
        or `Class.SpawnLocation.Neutral` is set to true

      If RespawnLocation is not set to a valid `Class.SpawnLocation` then the
      default spawning logic will apply. For more information on this see the
      page for `Class.SpawnLocation`.

      ##### Alternatives to RespawnLocation

      - A `Class.Player` will spawn from `Class.SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations`
        belonging to their team. In some cases it may be simpler to change the
        player's `Class.Player.Team` instead.
      - Implement your own custom spawn logic using `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()`
        to manually move the `Class.Player.Character`.

    description: |
      The TeamColor property determines which team a Player is associated with
      according to that Team's `Class.Team.TeamColor`. Changing this property
      will change `Class.Player.Team` according to whichever team has the same
      `Datatype.BrickColor` for their `Class.Team.TeamColor`. If no Team object
      has the associated TeamColor, the player will not be associated with a
      team.

      It's often a better idea to set `Class.Player.Team` to the respective
      `Class.Team` instead of using this property. Setting this property often
      leads to repetition of the same BrickColor value for a certain team across
      many scripts; this is something you want to avoid when adhering to the
      [don't-repeat-yourself][1] principle.

      #### GetJoinData and TeleportData

      If a server initiates the Player's teleport, the dictionary that this
      method returns includes the player's teleport data. The
      `Class.Player:GetJoinData()` method can only be used to fetch teleport
      data on the server. To fetch the data on the client, use
      `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`.

      Unlike `Class.TeleportService:GetLocalPlayerTeleportData()`,
      `Class.Player:GetJoinData()` only provides teleport data that meets the
      following security criteria:

      - It's guaranteed to have been sent by a Roblox server in the past 48
        hours.
      - It's guaranteed to have been sent with this `Class.Player`.
      - The `SourcePlaceId` and `SourceGameId` are guaranteed to be the place
        and universe the data was sent from. This means you can verify the
        teleport data came from an approved place.

      As this data is transmitted by the client, it can still potentially be
      abused by an exploiter. Sensitive data such as player currency should be
      transmitted via a secure solution like
      [Memory Stores](../../../cloud-services/memory-stores/index.md).

      #### LaunchData

      Contains the string embedded in the launchData URL parameter that the user
      clicked to join the experience. Only available on the first join. If the
      user teleports to another server, the data isn't included. If you need the
      data after a teleport, forward it manually as teleport data. You can only
      include LaunchData in direct join URLs, not URLs to the experience's page.

      LaunchData is a URL parameter that you can create by adding
      `&launchData=abcd` to a URL, where `abcd` is the data. Special characters
      such as spaces must be URL encoded using `Class.HttpService:UrlEncode()`
      and are automatically decoded when the user joins the game. The decoded
      launch data can't exceed 200 bytes. You can store more complex data as a
      JSON string and decode it with `Class.HttpService:JSONDecode()` on the
      server.

      This link joins the LaunchData sample place and starts the user in room 2:
      `https://www.roblox.com/games/start?placeId=6900305353&launchData=%7B%22roomId%22%3A%202%7D`

      You can also make sure that this link works for users without Roblox
      downloaded on their mobile devices by using the AppsFlyer version of the
      link. The above link would look like:

      `ro.blox.com/Ebh5?af_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2Fstart%3FplaceId%3D6900305353%26launchData%3D%257B%2522roomId%2522%253A%25202%257D&af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2Fstart%3FplaceId%3D6900305353%26launchData%3D%257B%2522roomId%2522%253A%25202%257D`

      To build the AppsFlyer version of the link, you need to start the URL with
      `ro.blox.com/Ebh5?` and append the af_dp and af_web_dp parameters with the
      URL encoded version of Link 1.

      Don't store confidential information in the LaunchData because it's fully
      visible in the URL. Furthermore, the data might not be authentic because a
      user can modify the URL.

    summary: |
      Returns the isolated network latency in seconds.
    description: |
      **GetNetworkPing** returns the isolated network latency of the
      `Class.Player` in seconds. "Ping" is a measurement of the time taken for
      data to be sent from the client to the server, then back again. It doesn't
      involve data deserialization or processing.

      For client-side `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, this function can only
      be called on the `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`. This function is useful in
      identifying and debugging issues that occur in high network latency
      scenarios. It's also useful for masking latency, such as adjusting the
      speed of throwing animations for projectiles.

    description: |
      The HasAppearanceLoaded `Class.Player` function returns whether or not the
      appearance of the player's `Class.Player.Character` has loaded.

      A player's appearance includes items such as the player's `Class.Shirt`,
      `Class.Pants`, and `Class.Accessory|Accessories`.

      This is useful when determining whether a player's appearance has loaded
      after they first join the game, which can be tracked using the
      `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` event.

  - name: Player:IsVerified
    summary: |
      Returns whether the player is verified with concrete, real-world signals.
    description: |
      Returns a boolean value indicating that player's verification status. When
      true, the player is verified. Verification includes, but isn't limited to,
      non-VOIP phone number or government ID verification.

      When implementing `IsVerified`, exercise caution to ensure that the
      implementation does not inadvertently block all unverified users.

      Note that the method can only be called on the backend server. Calling it
      client-side results in an error. Additionally, this method will always
      return `false` in Studio.

    summary: |
      Forcibly disconnect a player from the game, optionally providing a

    description: |
      The `Class.Player.Kick|Kick()` method allows an experience to gracefully
      disconnect a client and optionally provide a message to the disconnected
      user. This is useful for moderating abusive users. You should only allow
      specific users whom you trust to trigger this method on other users.

      Calling this method on a `Class.Player` with no arguments disconnects the
      user from the server and provides a default notice message. Calling this
      method on a `Class.Player` along with a string as the first argument
      replaces the default message with the provided string.

      When using this method from a `Class.LocalScript`, only the local user's
      client can be kicked.

      The LoadCharacterAppearance `Class.Player` function places the given
      instance either in the player's `Class.Player.Character`, head, or
      `Class.StarterGear` based on the instance's class.

      This is useful when giving a player's character an asset from the Roblox
      catalog, such as a hat or piece of gear.

      It is similar to `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()`, except it does not reload
      the entire character instance, StarterGear, or `Class.PlayerGui`.

      Note:

      - `Class.Accessory`, `Class.Shirt`, `Class.ShirtGraphic`,
        `Class.CharacterMesh`, `Class.BodyColors`, and `Class.Accoutrement` are
        parented to the player's character.
      - `Class.Decal`, `Class.FileMesh`, `Class.SpecialMesh`, `Class.BlockMesh`,
        `Class.CylinderMesh`, and `Class.Texture` are parented to the
        character's head.
      - `Class.Tool` is parented to the player's `Class.StarterGear`.
      - All other classes are ignored.

      The Move `Class.Player` function causes the player's character to walk in
      the given direction until stopped, or interrupted by the player (by using
      their controls).

      This is useful when scripting NPC `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` that move
      around a map - but are not controlled by an actual player's input.

      Note that the function's second argument indicates whether the provided

      (_false_) or the player's `Class.Camera` (_true_).

      Returns a dictionary of online friends.
    description: |
      This function returns a dictionary array of online friends, limited by the
      `maxFriends` value. The function uses a 30 second cache.

      In the returned array, some fields are only present for certain location
      types. For example, **PlaceId** won't be present when **LocationType** is
      0 (Mobile Website).

      The GetRankInGroup `Class.Player` function returns the player's rank in
      the group as an integer between 0 and 255, where 0 is a non-member and 255
      is the group's owner.

      Using this in a `Class.Script`, as opposed to a `Class.LocalScript`, will
      not get you the most up-to-date information. If a player leaves a group
      while they are in the game, GetRankInGroup will still think they're in
      that group until they leave. However, this does not happen when used with
      a LocalScript.

      This is because the method caches results, so multiple calls of
      GetRankInGroup on the same player with the same group ID will yield the
      same result as when the method was first called with the given group ID.
      The caching behavior is on a per-peer basis: a server does not share the
      same cache as a client.

    description: |
      The LoadCharacter `Class.Player` function creates a new character for the
      player, removing the old one. It also clears the player's `Class.Backpack`
      and `Class.PlayerGui`.

      This is useful in cases where you want to reload the character without
      killing the player, such as when you want to load a new character
      appearance after changing the player's `Class.Player.CharacterAppearance`.

      Note: The function is similar to `Class.Player:LoadCharacterBlocking()`,
      but the request is processed asynchronously instead of synchronously. This
      means other tasks will be able to continue while the character is being
      loaded, including the rendering of the game and any other tasks. Also,
      this function can be used in a script, while LoadCharacterBlocking cannot.

      After calling LoadCharacter for an individual player, it is not
      recommended to call it again for the same player until after that player's
      `Class.Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded` event has fired.

      #### Character Loading Event order

      Calling the `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()` with an R15 Avatar fires events
      in the following order (Note: R6 ordering is different):

      1. Player.Character sets
      2. Player.CharacterAdded fires
      3. Player.Changed fires with a value of "Character"
      4. Character appearance initializes
      5. Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded fires
      6. Character.Parent sets to the DataModel
      7. The Character rig builds, and the Character scales
      8. Character moves to the spawn location
      9. LoadCharacter returns

      Requests that the server stream to the player around the specified

    description: |
      For experiences where instance
      [streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md) is enabled, requests that the
      server stream to the player regions (parts and terrain) around the
      specified **X**, **Y**, **Z** location in the 3D world. It is useful if
      the experience knows that the player's `Datatype.CFrame` will be set to
      the specified location in the near future. Without providing the location
      with this call, the player may not have streamed in content for the
      destination, resulting in a streaming pause or other undesirable behavior.

      The effect of this call will be temporary and there are no guarantees of
      what will be streamed in around the specified location. Client memory
      limits and network conditions may impact what will be available on the
      client.

      #### Usage Precaution

      Requesting streaming around an area is **not a guarantee** that the
      content will be present when the request completes, as streaming is
      affected by the client's network bandwidth, memory limitations, and other
      factors.

events:
  - name: Player.CharacterAdded
    summary: |
      Fired when a player's character spawns or respawns.
    description: |
      The **CharacterAdded** event fires when a player's character spawns (or
      respawns). This event fires soon after setting `Class.Player.Character` to
      a non-`nil` value or calling `Class.Player:LoadCharacter()`, which is
      before the character is parented to the `Class.Workspace`.

      This can be used alongside the `Class.Player.CharacterRemoving` event,
      which fires right before a player's character is about to be removed,
      typically after death. As such, both of these events can potentially fire
      many times as players die then respawn in a place. If you want to detect
      when a player joins or leaves the game, use the
      `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` and `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving` events
      instead.

      Note that the `Class.Humanoid` and its default body parts (head, torso,
      and limbs) will exist when this event fires, but clothing items like
      `Class.Hat|Hats`, `Class.Shirt|Shirts`, and `Class.Pants` may take a few
      seconds to be added to the character. Connect `Class.Instance.ChildAdded`
      on the added character to detect these, or wait for the
      `Class.Player.CharacterAppearanceLoaded` event to be sure the character
      has everything equipped.

      This event fires when the full appearance of a `Class.Player.Character`
      has been inserted.

      A `Class.Player.Character` generally has a range of objects modifying its
      appearance, including `Class.Accoutrement|Accoutrements`,
      `Class.Shirt|Shirts`, `Class.Pants` and
      `Class.CharacterMesh|CharacterMeshes`. This event will fire when all such
      objects have been inserted into the `Class.Player.Character`.

    description: |
      The CharacterRemoving event fires right before a player's character is
      removed, such as when the player is respawning.

      This event can be used alongside the `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` event,
      which fires when a player's character spawns or respawns. For instance, if
      you would like to print a message every time a player spawns and dies:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      local function onCharacterSpawned(player)
      	print(player.Name .. " is spawning")
      end

      local function onCharacterDespawned(player)

      This event is only concerned with the `Class.Player.Character|Character`
      of a `Class.Player`. If you instead need to track when a player
      joins/leaves the game, use the events `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` and
      `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving`.

    parameters:
      - name: character
        type: Model
        default:
        summary: |
          An instance of the character that is being removed.

  - name: Player.Chatted
    summary: |
      Fires when a player chats in-game using Roblox's provided chat bar.
    description: |
      The Chatted event fires when a `Class.Player` types a message and presses
      enter in Roblox's provided chat bar. This is done using some Lua bindings
      by the default chat script. You can prevent players from chatting by using
      `Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled()` and disabling the Chat
      `Enum.CoreGuiType`.

      #### Chat Commands

      Using this event and some string manipulation functions like
      `Library.string.sub()` and `Library.string.lower()`, it is possible to
      create chat commands, even with arguments like player names. Usually,
      commands are prefixed such as `heal PlayerName`. To check for a prefix in
      a string, use `Library.string.sub()` on the message to check a substring
      of the message: `string.sub(message, 1, 6) == "/heal "` (note the
      inclusion of the space). Then, extract the rest of the command using
      `Library.string.sub()` again: `string.sub(message, 7)` will be equal to
      the player name. Check if that player exists, and if so, perform the
      command's action (in this example, healing them). Check the code samples
      for examples of chat commands.

      #### Filtering

      The message text fired with this event is **unfiltered**. If you are
      displaying player input like chat to other players in any form, it must be
      filtered using `Class.Chat:FilterStringAsync()`. Keep this in mind when
      creating your own chat systems; if your game does not properly filter chat
      it may have moderation action taken against it.
    code_samples:
      - Player-Chatted1
      - Playing-Spectating-Teams
      - Join-Team-Command
    parameters:
      - name: message
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          The content of the message the player typed in chat.
      - name: recipient
        type: Player
        default:
        summary: |
          **Deprecated.** For whisper messages, this was the Player who was the
          intended target of the chat message.

  - name: Player.Idled
    summary: |
      Usually fired two minutes after the game engine classes the player as
      idle. Time is the amount of seconds since this point.
    description: |
      This event is usually fired two minutes after the game engine classifies
      the `Class.Player|player` as idle. Time is the amount of seconds since
      this point.

      This can be used to track when a player has been idled for approximately
      two minutes - which can be useful for implementing away from keyboard
      (AFK) features into a game.

      When the game engine classifies a player as idle, this event is called
      after two minutes. After every check, if the player is still idled, the
      event will continue to fire until the check reveals the player is no
      longer idle.

      This event is used by Roblox to automatically disconnect players that have
      been idle for at least 20 minutes. If you would like to track when this
      disconnect occurs, consider using `Class.Players.PlayerRemoving` alongside
      this event.

      - Player-Idled1
    parameters:
      - name: time
        type: double
        default:
        summary: |
          The time in seconds the player has been idle.

  - name: Player.OnTeleport
    summary: |
      Fired when the TeleportState of a player changes.
    description: |
      Fired when the TeleportState of a player changes. This event is useful for
      detecting whether a teleportation was successful.

      #### What is the TeleportState?

      When a teleportation request is made using `Class.TeleportService`, there
      are a series of stages before the `Class.Player` is teleported. The
      current stage is represented by the `Enum.TeleportState` value which is
      given by OnTeleport. See below for a practical example of this.
    code_samples:
      - Player-OnTeleport1
    parameters:
      - name: teleportState
        type: TeleportState
        default:
        summary: |
          The new `Enum.TeleportState` of the `Class.Player`.
      - name: placeId
        type: int64
        default:
        summary: |
          The ID of the place the `Class.Player` is being teleported to.
      - name: spawnName
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          The name of the spawn to teleport to, if
          `Class.TeleportService:TeleportToSpawnByName()` has been used.
