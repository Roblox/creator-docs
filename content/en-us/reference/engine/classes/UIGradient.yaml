name: UIGradient
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a color and transparency gradient to the UI elements rendered by the
  parent `Class.GuiObject`.
description: |
  **UIGradient** applies a color and transparency gradient to the UI elements
  rendered by the parent `Class.GuiObject`. The appearance of the gradient is
  configurable through its `Class.UIGradient.Color|Color`
  (`Datatype.ColorSequence`), `Class.UIGradient.Transparency|Transparency`
  (`Datatype.NumberSequence`), `Class.UIGradient.Offset|Offset`
  (`Datatype.Vector2`), and `Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation` (number).

  A `Class.UIGradient` will not apply to child or descendant
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`. In order to apply the same gradient to multiple
  objects, you will need multiple gradient instances.

  See also [Appearance Modifiers](../../../ui/appearance-modifiers.md) for more
  information on `Class.UIGradient` objects and how they work.

  #### Supported Objects

  You can apply gradients to `Class.Frame`, `Class.TextLabel`,
  `Class.TextButton`, `Class.ImageLabel`, `Class.ImageButton`, and
  `Class.ViewportFrame`. However, `Class.ScrollingFrame` and `Class.TextBox` are
  not currently supported.

  #### Performance Considerations

  In order to efficiently use a `Class.UIGradient`, follow these principles:

  - Avoid using more than 6 color stops on the `Class.UIGradient.Color|Color`
    sequence.

  - Avoid using a `Class.UIGradient` on any object that applies a text stroke
    (`Class.TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3|TextStrokeColor3`), as the gradient will
    try to blend with strokes and borders, and may cause performance issues.

  - Avoid setting `Class.UIGradient.Color|Color` and
    `Class.UIGradient.Transparency|Transparency` frequently: this causes the
    sequence of colors to rebuild often, which is expensive. If possible, set
    these properties only once and try to animate the
    `Class.UIGradient.Offset|Offset` or `Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation`
    properties to achieve a similar effect. Alternatively, you can change the
    color of the parent `Class.GuiObject` using such properties as
    `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3`,
    `Class.ImageLabel.ImageColor3|ImageColor3`, or
    `Class.TextLabel.TextColor3|TextColor3`.

  - When applying an unchanging gradient on a UI element whose state changes a
    lot, there is a tradeoff between using a `Class.UIGradient` (processing
    time) and a static gradient image (memory).

      This property describes the color to blend with the parent UI element
      along the provided `Datatype.ColorSequence`. This property works in a
      similar manner to `Class.Beam.Color` or `Class.Trail.Color`, except that
      it applies over an on-screen distance determined by the
      `Class.UIGradient.Offset|Offset` and `Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation`.

      Determines the scalar translation of the gradient from the center of the

    description: |
      This property determines the scalar translation of the gradient from the
      center of the parent `Class.GuiObject`. It is a scalar translation,
      meaning that the actual pixel offset is determined by the
      `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize` of the parent
      `Class.GuiObject`. So, a value of `(1, 0)` would shift the gradient
      horizontally to the right by a distance equal to the parent object's
      on‑screen size. Depending on the `Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation`,
      this may cause the gradient to be partially visible or not visible at all.

      Also see `Class.UIGradient.Rotation|Rotation` which also affects the
      geometry of the applied gradient.

      This property determines the **clockwise** rotation in degrees of the
      `Class.UIGradient` starting from left to right. The beginning and end
      control points snap to the edges of the parent `Class.GuiObject`, but
      maintain the provided rotation.

      of the applied gradient.
