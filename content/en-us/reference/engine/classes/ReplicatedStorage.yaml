name: ReplicatedStorage
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container service for objects that are replicated to all clients.
description: |
  `Class.ReplicatedStorage` is a general container service for objects that are
  available to both the server and connected clients. It is ideal for
  `Class.ModuleScript`, `Class.RemoteFunction`, `Class.RemoteEvent`, and other
  objects that are useful to both server-side `Class.Script|Scripts` and
  client-side `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`.

  Objects parented to this service are fully replicated to clients, and normal
  replication rules apply. Any changes that are made on the client persist but
  aren't replicated to the server. Client changes may be overwritten if the
  server does something that overwrites those changes.

  Certain changes on the client, such as moving an object from the
  `Class.Workspace` to `Class.ReplicatedStorage`, can lead to desynchronization
  issues (for example, physics updates not being replicated to the object).

  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` do not run when parented to this service,
  even if they are `Class.BaseScript.Enabled|Enabled`;
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` have various other locations where they
  eventually run on a `Class.Player` client such as
  `Class.StarterPlayerScripts`, `Class.StarterCharacterScripts`, or
  `Class.StarterGui`.

  Similarly, `Class.Script|Scripts` do not run when parented to this service
  unless you change their `Enum.RunContext` property from the default value of
  `Enum.RunContext.Legacy|Legacy`. Server `Class.Script|Scripts` that run on
  their own should be parented to `Class.ServerScriptService` instead.

  If a `Class.ModuleScript` within this service is required by any other script,
  it runs as normal. Such modules typically house code that is shared by the
  server and client.
