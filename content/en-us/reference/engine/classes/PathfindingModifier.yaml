description: |
  Pathfinding modifiers can be used to represent space that has a higher or
  lower cost to be traversed. When added as a child to a `Class.Part`, it takes
  that Part's volume to annotate areas of the navmesh that are inside and on top
  of it.

  You can include pathfinding modifiers in the
  `Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()` parameters and compute smarter paths
  across various materials or around defined regions.

  Note that when adding a `Class.PathfindingModifier` to a part, **either**:

  - The part is `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|collidable` and we are interested in
    modifying pathfinding costs of paths on top of this part, which we call
    **area**.
  - The part is `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|non-collidable` (and usually
    invisible in game) and we are interested in modifying pathfinding costs of
    paths inside the part, which we call **volume**.
