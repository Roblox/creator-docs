  A service which manages object collections using assigned tags.
description: |
  The `Class.CollectionService` manages groups (collections) of instances with
  tags. Tags are sets of strings applied to objects that replicate from the
  server to the client and in Team Create. They are also serialized when places
  are saved. At the moment, tags are not visible within Roblox Studio except
  with the use of a tag-editing plugin.

  The primary use of `Class.CollectionService` is to register instances with
  specific tags that you can use to extend their behavior. If you find yourself
  adding the same script to many different objects, perhaps a script that uses
  CollectionService would be better. Here are a couple examples:

  - In an obstacle course with many bricks that kill players, don't paste the
    same script in all your kill bricks! Instead, tag them with "KillBrick".
    Then, have any brick tagged as such kill the player.
  - Players with a VIP game pass could have their `Class.Humanoid` tagged "VIP",
    and be allowed through doors that only allow VIPs.
  - When creating a freeze-tag game, you could tag frozen players'
    `Class.Humanoid` objects with a "Frozen" tag. Then, use a
    `Class.LocalScript` to listen for the "Frozen" tag and create client-side
    visual effects to reduce the number of objects replicated from server to
    client.

  When working with collections and tags, it's a good idea to use an
  [object-oriented programming style](https://www.lua.org/pil/16.html). In
  almost all situations, tagged objects have their own identity, state and
  behavior. The pattern goes like this: when a tag is found
  (`Class.CollectionService:GetTagged()` and
  `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()`), create a Lua object with
  the Roblox instance. When it is removed
  (`Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`), call a cleanup/destroy
  method within the Lua object. See the code samples for a better idea of how
  this can be done.

  ## Replication

  When tags replicate, **all tags on an object replicate at the same time**.
  Therefore, if you set a tag on an object from the client then add/remove a
  **different** tag on the same object from the server, the client's local tags
  on the object are overwritten. In
  `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled|StreamingEnabled` places, instances can be
  unloaded as they leave the client's streamed area. If such an instance
  re-enters the streamed area, properties and tags will be re-synchronized from
  the server. This can cause changes made by `Class.LocalScript`s to be
  overwritten/removed.

      Applies a tag to an `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      AddTag will apply a tag to an `Class.Instance`, doing nothing if the tag
      is already applied to the instance. Successfully adding a tag will fire a
      signal created by `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()` with
      the given tag.

      **Warning:** When tagging an instance, it is common that some resources
      are used to give the tag its functionality, e.g. event connections or
      tables. To prevent memory leaks, it is a good idea to clean these up
      (disconnect, set to nil, etc) when no longer needed for a tag. Do this
      when calling `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()`, calling
      `Class.Instance:Destroy()` or in a function connected to a signal returned
      by `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`.

      Returns a signal that fires when a given tag is added to an object.
    description: |
      GetInstanceAdded is given a tag (a string) and returns a signal which
      fires under two conditions:

      - The tag is assigned to an instance within the `Class.DataModel` (game)
        using `Class.CollectionService:AddTag()`.
      - An instance with the given tag is added as a descendant of the
        `Class.DataModel`, e.g. by setting `Class.Instance.Parent` or similar.

      Subsequent calls to this method with the same tag return the same signal
      object. Consider also calling `Class.CollectionService:GetTagged()` to get
      a list of objects that already have a tag (and thus won't fire the event
      if they already are in the `Class.DataModel`).

      See also `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`, which
      returns an event that fires under similar conditions.

    description: |
      GetInstanceRemoved is given a tag (a string) and returns a signal which
      fires under two conditions:

      - The tag is removed from an instance within the `Class.DataModel` (game)
        using `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()`.
      - An instance with the given tag is removed as a descendant of the
        `Class.DataModel`, e.g. by un-setting `Class.Instance.Parent` or
        similar.

      Subsequent calls to this method with the same tag return the same signal
      object. The signal is useful for cleaning up resources used by objects
      that once had tags, such as disconnecting connections.

      See also `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()`, which returns
      an event that fires under similar conditions.

    description: |
      GetTagged returns an array of objects with a given tag which are
      descendants of the `Class.DataModel` (`game`). Such tags have been added
      using `Class.CollectionService:AddTag()`, and removing a tag using
      `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()` will ensure this method does not
      return them. Although the name of this method is past-tense, this method
      only returns objects **presently** tagged with the given tag. It will not
      return objects that once had a tag but no longer have it.

      If you want to detect all objects with a tag, both present and future, use
      this method to iterate over objects while also making a connection to a
      signal returned by `Class.CollectionService.GetinstanceAddedSignal`.

      This method does not guarantee any ordering of the returned objects.
      Additionally, it is possible that objects can have the given tag assigned
      to them, but not be a descendant of the `Class.DataModel`, i.e. its parent
      is nil. This method will not return such objects.

      GetTags is given an instance and returns an array of strings, which are

      local tags = CollectionService:GetTags(object)
      print("The object " .. object:GetFullName() .. " has tags: " .. table.concat(tags, ", "))
      ```

      This method is useful when you want to do something with multiple tags at
      once on an object. However, it would be inefficient to use this method to
      check for the existence of a single tag. For this, use
      `Class.CollectionService:HasTag()` to check for a single tag.

      HasTag returns whether a given object has a tag.

      - Using `Class.CollectionService:AddTag()` to add the tag will cause this
        method to return true.
      - Using `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()` to remove the tag will cause
        this method to return false.

      By extension, any tags returned by a call to
      `Class.CollectionService:GetTags()` on an object will return true when
      used with this method.
