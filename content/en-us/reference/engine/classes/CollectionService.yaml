name: CollectionService
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A service which manages instance collections using assigned tags.
description: |
  `CollectionService` manages groups (collections) of instances with **tags**.
  Tags are sets of strings applied to instances that replicate from the server
  to the client. They are also serialized when places are saved.

  The primary use of `CollectionService` is to register instances with specific
  tags that you can use to extend their behavior. If you find yourself adding
  the same script to many different instances, a script that uses
  `CollectionService` may be better.

  Tags can be added or removed through this class' methods such as
  `Class.CollectionService:AddTag()|AddTag()` or
  `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()|RemoveTag()`. They can also be managed
  directly in Studio through the
  [Tags](../../../studio/properties.md#instance-tags) section of an instance's
  properties.

  ##### Replication

  When tags replicate, **all tags on an instance replicate at the same time**.
  Therefore, if you set a tag on an instance from the client then add/remove a
  **different** tag on the same instance from the server, the client's local
  tags on the instance are overwritten. In
  `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled|StreamingEnabled` places, instances can be
  unloaded as they leave the client's streamed area. If such an instance
  re-enters the streamed area, properties and tags will be re-synchronized from
  the server. This can cause changes made by `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` to
  be overwritten/removed.

    summary: |
      Applies a tag to an `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      This method applies a tag to an `Class.Instance`, doing nothing if the tag
      is already applied to that instance. Successfully adding a tag will fire a
      signal created by
      `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()|GetInstanceAddedSignal()`
      with the given tag.

      ##### Warnings

      - An instance's tags that were added client-side will be dropped if the
        server later adds or removes a tag on that instance because the server
        replicates all tags together and overwrites previous tags.

      - When tagging an instance, it is common that some resources are used to
        give the tag its functionality, for example event connections or tables.
        To prevent memory leaks, it's a good idea to clean these up (disconnect,
        set to `nil`, etc.) when no longer needed for a tag. Do this when
        calling `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()|RemoveTag()`, calling
        `Class.Instance:Destroy()` or in a function connected to a signal
        returned by
        `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()|GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`.

    description: |
      Given a tag (string), this method returns a signal which fires under two
      conditions:

      - The tag is assigned to an instance within the `Class.DataModel` using
        `Class.CollectionService:AddTag()` or `Class.Instance:AddTag()`.

      - An instance with the given tag is added as a descendant of the
        `Class.DataModel`, for example by setting `Class.Instance.Parent` or
        similar.

      Subsequent calls to this method with the same tag return the same signal
      object. Consider also calling
      `Class.CollectionService:GetTagged()|GetTagged()` to get a list of
      instances that already have a tag (and thus won't fire the event if they
      already are in the `Class.DataModel`).

      See also
      `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()|GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`
      which returns an event that fires under similar conditions.

      - The tag is removed from an instance within the `Class.DataModel` using

      - An instance with the given tag is removed as a descendant of the

        similar.

      Subsequent calls to this method with the same tag return the same signal
      object. The signal is useful for cleaning up resources used by instances
      that once had tags, such as disconnecting connections.

    description: |
      This method returns an array of instances with a given tag which are
      descendants of the `Class.DataModel`. Removing a tag using
      `Class.CollectionService:RemoveTag()` or `Class.Instance:RemoveTag()`
      ensures this method does not return them.

      If you want to detect all instances with a tag, both present **and**
      future, use this method to iterate over instances while also making a
      connection to a signal returned by
      `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()|GetInstanceAddedSignal()`.

      This method does not guarantee any ordering of the returned instances.
      Additionally, it's possible that instances can have the given tag assigned
      to them but not be a descendant of the `Class.DataModel`, for example its
      parent is `nil`; this method will not return such instances.

      Given an `Class.Instance`, this method returns an array of strings which
      are the tags applied to the instance.

      This method is useful when you want to do something with multiple instance
      tags at once, but it's inefficient to check for the existence of a single
      tag. For this, use `Class.CollectionService:HasTag()|HasTag()` to check
      for a single tag.

      `true` when used with this method.
