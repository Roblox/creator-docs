description: |
  `SelectionBox` renders a 3D box around its `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`
  when it is a descendant of the `Class.Workspace` or anywhere where GUI objects
  are rendered. The box's geometry consists of rectangular prisms forming an
  outline/wireframe in addition to a surface for each of its faces.
  `SelectionBox` does not capture any form of input; it is solely a visual
  effect.

  For an outline/fill overlay effect which covers nonâ€‘primitive geometry such as
  that of a `Class.MeshPart`, see `Class.Highlight`.

      `LineThickness` determines the thickness of the box's outlines, measured
      in studs. If set to `0`, the outline will not be visible at all.

      `SurfaceColor3` determines the color of the box's surfaces.

      See also `Class.SelectionBox.Color3|Color3`, a property of the superclass
      `Class.GuiBase3d` which controls the color of the outline rather than the
      surface faces.

    summary: |
      Determines the transparency of the box's surfaces.
    description: |
      `SurfaceTransparency` determines the transparency of the box's surfaces,
      similar to the way `Class.BasePart.Transparency` works. By default, this
      property is `1` which causes the surfaces to be invisible.

      See also `Class.SelectionBox.Transparency|Transparency`, a property of the
      superclass `Class.GuiBase3d` which controls the transparency of the
      outline rather than the surfaces.
