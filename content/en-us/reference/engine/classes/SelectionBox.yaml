description: |
  **SelectionBox** is an object which renders a 3D box around its
  `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee|Adornee` when it is a descendant of the
  `Class.Workspace` or anywhere where GUI objects are rendered. The box's
  geometry consists of rectangular prisms forming an outline/wireframe in
  addition to a surface for each of its faces. By default, only the outline is
  visible.

  <img src="/assets/legacy/SelectionBox.jpg" alt="A default SelectionBox adorned to a default Part"  />
  There are several properties available to configure the appearance of the
  cube. The outline can modified through the
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Color3|Color3`&dagger;,
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Transparency|Transparency`&dagger; and
  `Class.SelectionBox.LineThickness|LineThickness` properties. The faces can be
  modified through the `Class.SelectionBox.SurfaceColor3|SurfaceColor3` and
  `Class.SelectionBox.SurfaceTransparency|SurfaceTransparency` properties.
  Finally, rendering of the box can be toggled with the
  `Class.GuiBase3d.Visible|Visible`&dagger; property.

  &dagger; These properties come from this object's superclass,
  `Class.GuiBase3d`.

  The SelectionBox object does not capture any form of input; it is solely a
  visual effect. To capture simple pointer input on the adornee, consider using
  a `Class.ClickDetector`.

      Determines the thickness of the boxes outlines, in studs.
    description: |
      **LineThickness** determines the thickness of the box's outlines. It is
      measured in studs, the same unit for `Class.BasePart.Size`. If set to 0,
      the outline will not be visible at all.

      <img src="/assets/legacy/SelectionBox.LineThickness.jpg" alt="Three SelectionBoxes with LineThickness values of 0.075, 0.15 (default) and 0.3" />

      Pictured above are three default `Class.Part|Parts` with default
      SelectionBoxes applied to them. Their thicknesses from left-to-right are
      0.075, 0.15 (default) and 0.3.

      **SurfaceTransparency** determines the transparency of the SelectionBox's
      surfaces, similar to the way `Class.BasePart.Transparency` works. By
      default, this property is 1, which causes the surfaces to not be visible.
