  A type of script object that runs once when `require` is called with it.
  Returns exactly one value, usually a table of functions, to used by other
  scripts. Useful for compartmentalizing code.

  A ModuleScript is a type of Lua source container that runs once and must
  return exactly one value. This value is then returned by a call to `require`
  given the ModuleScript as the only argument. ModuleScripts run once and only
  once per Lua environment and return the exact same value for subsequent calls
  to `require`.

  ModuleScripts are essential objects for adhering to the don't-repeat-yourself
  (DRY) principle. When you write a function, write it only once and use it
  everywhere. Having multiple copies of a function is disastrous when you need
  to change that behavior. So, you should define functions or groups of
  functions in ModuleScripts and have your Scripts and LocalScripts call
  `require` on your ModuleScripts. Keep your code organized!

  It's important to know that return values from ModuleScripts are independent
  with regards to LocalScripts and Scripts, and other environments like the
  Command Bar. Using `require` on a ModuleScript in a LocalScript will run the
  code on the client, even if a Script did so already on the server. Similarly,
  in Roblox Studio, using `require` on a ModuleScript in the hierarchy with the
  Command Bar will give a similar behavior. So, be careful if you are using a
  ModuleScript on the client and server at the same time, or debugging it within
  Studio.

  Note that the first call to `require` on a ModuleScript will not yield (halt)
  unless the ModuleScript yields (e.g. calls `Library.task.wait()`). The current thread that
  called `require` will yield until a ModuleScript returns a value. A run time
  error is generated if this doesn't happen. If a ModuleScript is attempting to
  `require` another ModuleScript that in turn tries to `require` it, the
  **thread will hang and never halt (cyclic `require` calls do not generate
  errors).** Be mindful of your module dependencies in large projects!

  If a ModuleScript object has its Name property set to 'MainModule' and is
  uploaded to Roblox as a model to your account, Scripts can use `require` with
  the uploaded model's AssetId instead. This allows you to create private
  modules on your Roblox account!
