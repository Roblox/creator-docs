      Sets the state of the calling plugin to activated.
    description: |
      This method sets the state of the calling plugin to activated. Activating
      the plugin allows mouse control through the
      `Class.Plugin:GetMouse()|GetMouse()` method.

      At any given time, there are either 0 or 1 activated plugins. Activating a
      plugin will deactivate all other plugins and they will receive a
      `Class.Plugin.Deactivation|Deactivation` event.

      #### See Also

      - `Class.Plugin:IsActivatedWithExclusiveMouse()|IsActivatedWithExclusiveMouse()`
        which returns `true` if the plugin is currently active with an exclusive
        mouse, after having been activated via this method.
      - `Class.Plugin.Unloading|Unloading` which fires immediately before the
        plugin is unloaded or reloaded via uninstallation, deactivation, or
        updating.

      given key doesn't exist.

      Because multiple instances of the same plugin can run simultaneously (for
      example, if multiple Studio windows are open), you shouldn't depend on
      this value staying the same over time. The other plugin instances can
      update the setting at any time.

      This call can silently fail and return `nil` if multiple instances of the
      same plugin are actively reading and writing data. If your plugin expects
      to write to settings frequently, you should double-check the returned
      value from this call after a short while to distinguish between a setting
      being temporarily unavailable and a setting not existing.

      Stores a given value for later use under the given key. The value will
      persist even after Roblox Studio is closed. These settings are saved in
      `.json` format as a map with string keys. Arrays are automatically
      converted to maps by converting the numeric keys to strings first.

      Note that the `.json` format imposes additional restrictions, including
      the following characters which can corrupt the settings file:

      - Backslashes (`\`) in keys or values, in particular escaped quotes
        (`\"`).
      - Newlines (`\n`) in keys.
      - Quotes (`"`) in keys.
      - Periods (`.`) in keys.

      This call can silently fail if multiple instances of the same plugin are
      actively reading and writing data. If your plugin expects to write to
      settings frequently, you may check that the data has been properly written
      by calling `Class.Plugin:GetSetting()|GetSetting()`.

      Fired when the `Class.Plugin` is deactivated. This occurs when either the
      plugin code calls `Class.Plugin:Deactivate()|Deactivate()`, or because
      some other plugin called `Class.Plugin:Activate()|Activate()`, which
      forces all other plugins to lose their active state.

    description: |
      This event fires immediately before the `Class.Plugin` stops running.
      Plugins are unloaded when disabled, uninstalled, about to be updated, or
      when the place is closing.

      It enables a plugin to clean up after itself before its scripts stop
      running, e.g. to remove unnecessary instances from the `Class.DataModel`.
      If a plugin does not clean up properly, the old copies will remain. When
      this occurs, users may be forced to close and reopen the place which is a
      bad user experience.

      Plugin-related instances such as
      `Class.PluginToolbarButton|PluginToolbarButtons`,
      `Class.DockWidgetPluginGui|DockWidgetPluginGuis`, and
      `Class.PluginGui|PluginGuis` are automatically cleaned up when the plugin
      is unloaded so there is no need to remove them.
