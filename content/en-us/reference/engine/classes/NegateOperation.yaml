summary: |
  Result of a part that has been negated for use in solid modeling.
description: |
  A **NegateOperation** is the result of a part that has been negated through
  Studio's solid modeling **Negate** tool.

  A negated part turns pink and translucent as an indicator of its state. If the
  negated part is then unioned with a normal part using the **Union** tool,
  sections where the negated part overlaps the normal part will be cut out.

  Note that you can undo part negation by selecting the negated part and
  clicking **Negate** again.

  See [Solid Modeling](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) to learn more about
  Studio's solid modeling tools and methods.
