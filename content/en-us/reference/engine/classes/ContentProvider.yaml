  Service that loads content (assets) into a game.

  Roblox servers stream all assets to the client at runtime: objects in the
  Workspace, mesh assets, texture assets, etc. Assets such as mesh visual data,
  textures, decals, and sounds are streamed in as required, regardless of
  whether [Streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md) is enabled.

  In some cases, this behavior is undesirable, as it can lead to a delay before
  the content loads into the experience.

  `ContentProvider` lets you preload assets into an experience using the
  `Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync()` method. You might want to display a
  loading screen, preload critical assets, and only then allow the player into
  the experience.

  #### Best Practices for Preloading

  - Only preload essential assets, **not** the entire `Class.Workspace`. You
    might get occasional pop-in, but it decreases load times and generally
    doesn't disrupt the player experience. Assets that are good candidates for
    preloading include those required for the loading screen, the UI, or the
    starting area.
  - Let players skip the loading screen, or automatically skip it after a
    certain amount of time.

      Used by the `Class.ContentProvider` to download assets from the Roblox
      website.

      This URL points to a Roblox hosted website from which assets are
      downloaded and is pulled from the AppSettings.xml file, located in the
      version-hash folder.

      It is possible to overwrite this property using the
      `Class.ContentProvider:SetBaseUrl()` function in the command bar; however,
      this is not recommended and may cause asset loading issues.

      Gives the number of items in the `Class.ContentProvider` request queue
      that need to be downloaded.

      Items are added to the client's request queue when an asset is used for
      the first time or `Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync()` is called.

      Developers are advised not to use RequestQueueSize to create loading bars.
      This is because the queue size can both increase and decrease over time as
      new assets are added and downloaded. Developers looking to display loading
      progress should load assets one at a time (see example below).

      A signal that fires when the `Enum.AssetFetchStatus` of the provided
      content changes. Connect to this signal by using a callback with one
      argument of type `Enum.AssetFetchStatus`. This is particularly useful for
      assets that might update themselves automatically like the thumbnail of a
      user when they change clothes.

      Usually, content is loaded only when it starts being used. That explains
      why it often takes a moment for an image to appear in a `Class.GuiObject`,
      or a `Mesh|mesh` to appear in a `Class.BasePart|part`, or why a
      `Class.Sound|sound` doesn't play for the first time. All because the asset
      has not yet finished loading. Preload is used to load this content
      beforehand, so that it works instantly.

      Yields until all of the assets associated with the given
      `Class.Instance|Instances` have loaded. This can be used to pause a script
      and not use content until it is certain that the content has been loaded
      into the experience.

      When called, the engine identifies links to content for each item in the
      list. For any of the `Class.Instance|Instances` which have properties that
      define links to content, such as a `Class.Decal|Decal` or a
      `Class.Sound|Sound`, the engine attempts to load these assets from Roblox.
      For each requested asset, the callback function runs, indicating the
      asset's final `Enum.AssetFetchStatus`.

      If any of the assets fail to load, an error message appears in the output.
      The method itself will not error and it will continue executing until it
      has processed each requested instance.

      ##### Limitations

      `Class.SurfaceAppearance` and `Class.MaterialVariant` are not supported by
      `Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync()|PreloadAsync()` because these
      objects rely on processed texture pack assets rather than directly loading
      individual textures. Calling it on a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` instance
      will not do anything, but the associated textures will still be streamed
      in during runtime.

      If PreloadAsync is called on `Class.Instance|Instances` that are not
      currently visible, such as a `Class.Decal` or an `Class.ImageLabel`, the
      Engine will download and store textures used by those Instances in its
      disk cache. Because the `Class.Instance|Instances` are not visible in
      these cases, the Engine may reduce memory consumption by unloading the
      textures after preloading them.
