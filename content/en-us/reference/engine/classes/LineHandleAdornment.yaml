summary: |
  A line that can be adorned to a `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's PlayerGui
  or the CoreGui. The **LineHandleAdornment** is a line that can be adorned to a
  `Class.BasePart`. This line starts at the center of the adornment's
  `Class.HandleAdornment.CFrame` (offset by the adornment's
  `Class.HandleAdornment.SizeRelativeOffset`) and will be oriented along its
  CFrame. This adornment can listen to input events and is commonly used to make
  dragger tools.
