description: |
  `LineHandleAdornment` is a line-shaped handle that can be adorned to a
  `Class.BasePart`. This line starts at the center of the adornment's
  `Class.LineHandleAdornment.CFrame|CFrame` (offset by its
  `Class.LineHandleAdornment.SizeRelativeOffset|SizeRelativeOffset`) and is
  oriented along its `Class.LineHandleAdornment.CFrame|CFrame`. If parented to a
  player's `Class.PlayerGui` or the `Class.CoreGui`, handles can listen to input
  events for purposes such as making dragger tools.
