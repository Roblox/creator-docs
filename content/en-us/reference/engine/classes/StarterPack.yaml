  A service-level container whose contents are copied into each player's
  `Class.Backpack` when the player spawns. It is generally used to hold `Tools`,
  but is sometimes used to hold `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` to ensure that
  each player gets a copy.

  When a player's character spawns, the contents of the StarterPack and their
  `Class.StarterGear` are copied into their `Class.Backpack`. Once a character
  dies, the `Class.Backpack` is removed and a new one is created -- populating
  it using the contents of `Class.StarterPack` and `Class.StarterGear`.

  The StarterPack is used to determine a set of `Class.Tool|Tools` that _all_
  players will spawn with. If a developer wants to ensure that certain
  `Class.Tool|Tools` are available to specific players, then they will need to
  parent the `Class.Tool|Tools` directly to the player's `Class.Backpack`
  instead.

  Note: while normally the contents of `Class.StarterPack` are predefined, the
  contents can be changed while the game is running by adding and removing
  `Class.Tool|Tools` accordingly. These updates will pass onto a player's
  backpack when they respawn and their backpacks are reloaded. Changes to the
  StarterPack should be made by the server.

  A tool can be added to the StarterPack using the following code.

      Tool.Parent = game:GetService("StarterPack")
