description: |
  The StarterCharacterScripts class stores scripts to be parented in a player's
  `Class.Player.Character`, when they spawn. Unlike scripts stored in the
  `Class.PlayerScripts` folder, these scripts will not persist when the player
  respawns.

  If a script named **Animate**, **Sound** or **Health** is placed in this
  folder, they will replace the default scripts that are added to each
  `Class.Player.Character` that is created.
