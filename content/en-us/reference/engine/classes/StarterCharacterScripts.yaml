name: StarterCharacterScripts
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Stores instances to be parented to a player's character when it spawns.
description: |
  The `Class.StarterCharacterScripts` container stores scripts to be parented to
  a player's `Class.Player.Character` when it spawns. Unlike scripts stored in
  the `Class.StarterPlayerScripts` folder, these scripts will not persist when
  the character respawns.

  If a `Class.LocalScript` named `Animate`, `Sound`, or `Health` is placed in
  this container, it will replace the default script that manages character
  animations, character sounds, and character health regeneration respectively.
