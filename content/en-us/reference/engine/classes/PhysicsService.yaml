description: |
  `Class.PhysicsService` primarily contains methods for working with **collision
  groups** which define whether a set of parts may or may not collide with parts
  in other collision groups. You can register a collision group through
  `Class.PhysicsService:RegisterCollisionGroup()|RegisterCollisionGroup()` and
  assign parts to it by setting those parts'
  `Class.BasePart.CollisionGroup|CollisionGroup` property to the **name** of the
  collision group.

  Creating, deleting, and modifying collision relationships between collision
  groups is limited to server-side `Class.Script|Scripts`.

  See
  [Collision Filtering](../../../workspace/collisions.md#collision-filtering)
  for usage details in Studio and within scripts.

      the collision group when it is removed, these parts will still maintain
      the same collision group ID. The physical behavior of parts in a removed
      group is undefined, so it is recommended to move any parts in a removed

      utilize the group. The first argument of this method is the name of the
      group to rename, the second argument is the new name for the group. If the
      specified group does not exist, this method will not do anything. The
      naming conventions for the new name follow the same rules as if the group
      was being created with
      `Class.PhysicsService:RegisterCollisionGroup()|RegisterCollisionGroup()`.

      This method will throw a runtime error in the following circumstances:

      - Invalid or empty name provided for either argument.
