deprecation_message: |
  This object serves no purpose other than being an abstract class that
  `Class.BlockMesh` and `Class.CylinderMesh` inherit from. Note non-character
  beveled parts were removed in 2013. Developers looking for beveled edges are
  required to use either `Class.UnionOperation|UnionOperations` or
  `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`.
