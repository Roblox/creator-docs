  The `Class.ControllerManager` instance manages simulated motion control for
  its assigned `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart`. It can be used to build a
  physics-based character controller.

      The `Class.ControllerBase` that is set to be activated on the character.
    description: |
      The `Class.ControllerBase` that is set to be activated on the character.
      It does not guarantee that the specified `Class.ControllerBase` is, in
      fact, active. If the `Class.ControllerBase` cannot be activated for
      whatever reason, such as being outside of the character's
      `Class.WorldRoot` or no `Class.Part` being found to use as the floor for a
      `Class.GroundController`, it will remain set and the
      `Class.ControllerManager` will attempt to activate it in the next frame.
      This property can be set to `nil` to disable the physics controller.

    description: |
      A reference to the sensor data used while a `Class.ClimbController` is
      active. A `Class.ClimbController` will use the
      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitPart`,
      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitFrame`, and
      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitNormal` for climb movement computations.
      Typically a `Class.ControllerPartSensor` set to `Enum.SensorMode.Ladder`
      is used here. Otherwise, you can override the sensor's outputs to direct
      what sensor data you want the `Class.ClimbController` to use.

      A reference to the sensor data used while a `Class.GroundController` is

      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitPart`,
      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitFrame`, and
      `Class.ControllerPartSensor.HitNormal` for ground movement computations.
      Typically a `Class.ControllerPartSensor` set to `Enum.SensorMode.Floor` is
      used here. Otherwise, you can override the sensor's outputs to direct what
      sensor data you want the `Class.GroundController` to use.

      The vector describing the desired direction to move in, with a magnitude
      between 0 and 1. This is multiplied by
      `Class.ControllerManager.BaseMoveSpeed|BaseMoveSpeed` to determine a final
      target move velocity. The `Class.ControllerManager.RootPart|RootPart` will
      attempt to move in this direction based on the rules defined by the
      `Class.ControllerManager.ActiveController|ActiveController`.
