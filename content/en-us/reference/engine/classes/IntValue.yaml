name: IntValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a single integer.
description: |
  Stores a single signed [64-bit integer](../../../luau/numbers.md#int64). The
  highest allowed value is 2^63-1 or around 9.2 quintillion (9.2^18). Attempting
  to store larger numbers causes an
  [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). The lowest
  allowed value is -2^63. Practically, however, working with integers larger
  than 2^53 (9^15) causes loss of precision since Luau uses double-precision
  floating-point to store numbers.

  It's possible to store values between 2^53 and 2^63-1 using the
  [Properties](../../../studio/properties.md) window since it uses strings to
  pass data to the engine, but manipulating large values via Luau scripts
  results in loss of precision and rounding as mentioned above.

  The main advantage of using **IntValue** lies in its rounding of values to the
  nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from 0. For values outside of
  this range, use `Class.NumberValue` instead.

  Like all `Class.ValueBase` objects, this single value is stored in the
  `Class.IntValue.Value|Value` property. The `Changed` event fires with the new
  value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

      Fires whenever the `Class.IntValue.Value` changes. It runs with the new
      value being stored in the argument object, instead of a string
      representing the property being changed.

      Listening for the `Changed` signal can be useful in games that use
      `IntValues` to track values like leaderboard statistics or item prices.
