name: IntValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a single integer.
description: |
  An **IntValue** stores a single signed
  [64-bit integer](../../../luau/numbers.md#int64). The highest allowed value is
  2^63-1 or around 9.2 quintillion (9.2^18); attempting to store larger numbers
  will cause [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow).
  The lowest allowed value is -2^63 or about -9.2 quintillion. Practically,
  however, working with integers larger than 2^53 (9.0^15) will cause loss of
  precision since Luau uses double-precision floating-point to store numbers.

  Note that it's possible to store values between 2^53 and 2^63-1 via the
  [Properties](../../../studio/properties.md) window since it uses strings to
  pass data to the engine, but manipulating large values via Luau scripts will
  result in loss of precision and rounding as mentioned above.

  The main advantage of using **IntValue** lies in its rounding of values to the
  nearest integer, with halfway cases rounded away from 0. For values outside of
  this range, use a `Class.NumberValue` instead. Like all `Class.ValueBase`
  objects, this single value is stored in the `Class.ValueBase.Value|Value`
  property.

  The `Class.IntValue.Changed|Changed` event for this (and other objects like
  it) will run with the new value being stored in the object, instead of a
  string representing the property being changed.

      This event fires whenever the `Class.IntValue.Value` is changed. It will
      run with the new value being stored in the argument object, instead of a
      string representing the property being changed.

      Equivalent change events exist for similar objects such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
