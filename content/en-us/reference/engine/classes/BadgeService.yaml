  Provides information on badges and awards them.
description: |
  `BadgeService` provides information and functionality related to
  [badges](../../../production/publishing/badges.md). Badges are used across the
  platform to recognize a player's achievements and activity. Upon awarding a
  badge to a player, it is added to their inventory and displayed on their
  profile page.

    summary: |
      Award a badge to a player given the ID of each.
    description: |
      Grants a `Class.Player` a badge with the `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` and
      the badge ID.

      In order to successfully award a badge:

      - The player must be presently connected to the experience.
      - The player must not already have the badge (note that a player may
        delete an awarded badge from their profile and be awarded the badge
        again).
      - The badge must be awarded from a server-side `Class.Script` or a
        `Class.ModuleScript` eventually required by a `Class.Script`, not from a
        `Class.LocalScript`.
      - The badge must be awarded in a place that is part of the experience
        associated with the badge.
      - The badge must be enabled; check this using the `IsEnabled` property of
        the badge fetched through `Class.BadgeService:GetBadgeInfoAsync()`.

      Rate limit is `50 + 35 * [number of users]` per minute.

      Checks a list of badge IDs against a `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` and
      returns a list of badge IDs that the player owns. This method supports
      batches of up to 10 badges; use `Class.BadgeService:UserHasBadgeAsync()`
      for single badge lookups.

      Any set of badges for any experience can be queried, no matter who created
      the badges or which experiences they are for. Any
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` can be used in a `Class.Script`, but in a
      `Class.LocalScript`, only the `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` of the local
      user whose client is running the script can be used.

      Rate limit is `10 + 5 * [number of players]` per minute in each server.

          IDs. Empty if none of the provided badges are owned by the given user.
          Not guaranteed to be in the same order as the input list.

      This method takes a brief moment to load the information from Roblox;
      repeated calls will cache for a short duration.

    summary: |
      Returns whether a given badge is disabled.
    description: |
      This function returns whether the badge with the given ID is marked
      **disabled** on the Roblox website. A badge can be disabled by its owner
      on its page on the Roblox website, in the settings sub-menu. When a badge
      is disabled, this function returns true and the badge can no longer be
      awarded. A badge may be quickly re-enabled through the same menu.

      In Studio, a badge can only be tested if it is **disabled**. Calling this
      function with an enabled badge in Studio will return **true** and produce
      a warning "Sorry, badges can only be tested if they are disabled on Roblox
      game servers".

      Note that even if a badge is enabled it may not necessarily be awardable
      (for example if it isn't associated with the current game).

      Badges that are associated with special events are a common reason for a
      badge to be disabled. Often, it is easier to simply disable a badge
      instead of hard-coding a time check for when some event ends.

      Determines if a given badge is associated with the current game.
    description: |
      This function determines if a given badge is associated with the current
      game. It returns true if the badge is associated with the current game.

      Badges can only be awarded from a place that is part of the game
      associated with the badge. This means, for example, a developer cannot
      award a badge associated with another developer's game.

      Even if this returns true, a badge may still not be award-able. For
      example, it may be disabled.

      Checks and returns whether a `Class.Player` owns a badge given their
      `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` and the badge ID. You can call the function
      from the server in a `Class.Script` or `Class.ModuleScript` eventually
      required by a `Class.Script`, and the user in question must be present in
      the server for the query to run. When calling the method from the client
      in a `Class.LocalScript`, it only works for the local user whose client is
      running the script.

      Any badge for any experience can be queried, no matter who created the
      badge or which experience it is used for.
