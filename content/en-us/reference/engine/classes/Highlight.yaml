  `Class.Highlight` is a visual effect you can use to call attention to a
  specific object within your experience. Every highlight effect has a
  silhouette **outline** that surrounds the object and a solid overlay
  **interior** that displays over the object's interior. You can customize both
  of these components independently to modify the highlight's visual appearance.

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Original Object</th>
        <th>Black Outline, Yellow Interior</th>
        <th>Yellow Outline, Black Interior</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="../../../assets/ui/highlighting-objects/OutlineTransparency-1.jpg" width="70%" />
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="../../../assets/ui/highlighting-objects/Overview-Yellow-Interior.jpg" width="70%" />
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>

  </table>

  Useful applications of the highlight effect include:

  - Providing visual feedback that an object is important and/or interactable.
  - Making distant objects visible through objects that are closer to the user.
  - Indicating the current position and status of other characters.

  **IMPORTANT:** As a performance limit, Studio only displays 31 simultaneous
  Highlight instances on the client at a time. If you exceed this limit, the
  additional instances are silently ignored. While a disabled `Class.Highlight`
  doesn't display, it still takes one of the 31 available `Class.Highlight`
  slots. If you plan to permanently disable a `Class.Highlight` instance, it's
  best to delete the highlight rather than disable it.

  For low-end devices, Studio uses a fallback version that doesn't have high
  performance overheads. This version doesn't have the outline effect; instead,
  it creates an interior fill with a checker pattern to emulate the
  `Class.Highlight.FillTransparency|FillTransparency` property.

      Controls how the Highlight effect displays with respect to other objects
      in the world. You can set this property to one of the following options:

      - `Enum.HighlightDepthMode.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` - Allows the highlight
        to display regardless if there are objects between the camera and the
        highlighted object. This means the user is always able to see the
        highlight regardless of what is between the highlighted object and the
        camera.

      - `Enum.HighlightDepthMode.Occluded|Occluded` - Hides the highlight if
        there are objects between the camera and the highlighted object. This
        means the user is only able to see the object if there are no
        obstructing objects between the highlighted object and the camera's
        view.
