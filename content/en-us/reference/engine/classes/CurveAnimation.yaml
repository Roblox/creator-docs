name: CurveAnimation
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Stores animation data in the form of curves for each individual channel to
  animate.
description: |
  `CurveAnimation` is a subtype of `Class.AnimationClip` consumed by Roblox's
  animation system. It stores animation data for each animated channel in a rig
  as a separate, individual curve. For example, `CurveAnimation` stores the
  position channel for an articulated joint as a `Class.Vector3Curve`, and it
  might store the rotation channel as a `Class.EulerRotationCurve` or
  `Class.RotationCurve`.

  #### Structure

  `CurveAnimation` stores curves in a hierarchical manner, matching the
  hierarchy of the structure of `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` or `Class.Bone|Bones`
  in the animated model. Under each `CurveAnimation` instance lies a hierarchy
  of `Class.Folder` instances representing animated joints in the model. Under
  each such folder instance, several possible instances may exist. An instance
  named `Position` of type `Class.Vector3Curve` can drive the local translation
  of the `Class.Motor6D` or `Class.Bone` on the animated model, while an
  instance named `Rotation` of type `Class.EulerRotationCurve` or
  `Class.RotationCurve` can drive the local rotation of the `Class.Motor6D` or
  `Class.Bone` on the animated model.

  #### Partial matching of hierarchy

  You can match partial hierarchies to a model when playing a `CurveAnimation`
  in Roblox's animation system. This means that not all joints need to be
  present in the hierarchy for the existing joints to apply properly.
  Furthermore, you can match hierarchies in a "relative" manner. For example,
  the first child `Class.Folder` instance root can be `UpperTorso` and the
  animation system matches that to any existing sub-hierarchies in the model.

  #### Animating miscellaneous channels

  `CurveAnimation` can also animate other numerical values in a model. For
  example, you can animate FACS controls for facial animations by creating a
  `Class.Folder` under the `CurveAnimation` instance named after an existing
  `Class.FaceControls` instance in the model. Then, to animate individual facial
  controllers, you can store individual `Class.FloatCurve` instances named after
  the animated `Class.FaceControls` property.

  #### Usage when making animations

  As with other `Class.AnimationClip` types such as `Class.KeyframeSequence`,
  you must first upload `CurveAnimation` instances to Roblox before playing
  them. If you want to preview an animation before uploading it to Roblox, you
  can generate a temporary ID using
  `Class.AnimationClipProvider:RegisterAnimationClip()`; this generates a hash
  ID that you can use for localized animation testing.

  If you want to download the `CurveAnimation` corresponding to an existing
  uploaded animation using Luau scripts, use
  `Class.AnimationClipProvider:GetAnimationClipAsync()`.
