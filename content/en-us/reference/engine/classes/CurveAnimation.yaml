  Stores animation data in the form of curves for each individual channel to
  animate.
description: |
  CurveAnimation is a subtype of `Class.AnimationClip` consumed by Roblox's
  animation system. It stores animation data for each animated channel in a Rig
  as a separate, individual curve. For example, CurveAnimation stores the
  Position channel for an articulated joint as `Class.Vector3Curve`, and it
  might store the Rotation channel as an `Class.EulerRotationCurve` or a
  `Class.RotationCurve`.

  ## CurveAnimation structure

  CurveAnimation stores curves in a hierarchical manner, matching the hierarchy
  of the structure of `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` or `Class.Bone|Bones` in the
  animated model. Under each CurveAnimation instance lies a hierarchy of
  `Class.Folder` instances representing animated joints in the model. Under each
  such folder instance, several possible instances may exist. An instance named
  'Position' of type `Class.Vector3Curve` can drive the local translation of the
  `Class.Motor6D` or `Class.Bone` on the animated model. Similarly, an instance
  named 'Rotation', of type either `Class.EulerRotationCurve` or
  `Class.RotationCurve` can drive the local rotation of the `Class.Motor6D` or
  `Class.Bone` on the animated model.

  ## Partial matching of hierarchy

  You can match partial hierarchies to a model when playing a CurveAnimation in
  Roblox's animation system. This means that not all joints need to be present
  in the hierarchy for the joints that are present to apply properly.
  Furthermore, you can match hierarchies in a 'relative' manner. For example, a
  CurveAnimation's first `Class.Folder` instance root can be `UpperTorso`, and
  the animation system matches that to any existing sub-hierarchies in the
  model.

  ## Animating miscellaneous channels

  Curve Animations can also animate other numerical values in a model. For
  example, you can animate FACS controls for facial animations by creating a
  folder under the CurveAnimation instance named after an existing
  `Class.FaceControls` instance in the model. Then, to animate individual facial
  controllers, you can store individual `Class.FloatCurve` instances named after
  the animated `Class.FaceControls` property.

  ## Using CurveAnimation when making animations

  As for other AnimationClip types (such as `Class.KeyframeSequence`), you must
  upload CurveAnimations to Roblox first before playing them. To do that, right
  click on the CurveAnimation and click 'Save to Roblox'. Alternatively, use
  `Class.Plugin:SaveSelectedToRoblox()` to bring up the animation upload window.

  If you want to preview an Animation before uploading it to the Roblox site,
  you can generate a temporary id using
  `AnimationClipProviderProvider:RegisterAnimationClip`. This generates a hash
  id that you can use for localized animation testing.

  ## Obtaining CurveAnimations

  As for other `Class.AnimationClip` types (such as `Class.KeyframeSequence`),
  if you want to download the CurveAnimation corresponding to an existing
  uploaded Animation using Lua scripts, use
  AnimationClipProvider:AnimationClipAsync.
