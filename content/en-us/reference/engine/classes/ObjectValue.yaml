name: ObjectValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a reference to another instance.
description: |
  Stores a single reference to another object. If this object is duplicated
  within Studio and the value refers to an object also being copied, then the
  new `ObjectValue` points to the copied object instead of the original.
  Otherwise, the same value is kept. Copying and pasting this object clears the
  value field.

  You can set the value within Studio like other reference-type fields (such as
  `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`): click the field within the Properties window, then
  click the object you wish to set it to within the game view or Explorer
  window. You can clear the field (set it to `nil`) by clicking the X that
  appears when you click the field.

  Like all `Class.ValueBase` objects, this single value is stored in the
  `Class.ObjectValue.Value|Value` property. The `Changed` event fires with the
  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

  If [streaming](../../../workspace/streaming.md) is enabled, the `Value`
  property is nil until the referenced object streams in, at which point the
  `Changed` event fires.

      Fires whenever the `Class.ObjectValue.Value` changes. It runs with the new
      value being stored in the argument object, instead of a string
      representing the property being changed.

      Listening for the `Changed` signal can be useful in games that use
      `ObjectValues` to track game state, such as an RPG targeting system.
