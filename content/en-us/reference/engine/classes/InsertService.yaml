  Used to insert assets from the Roblox website.
description: |
  InsertService is used to insert assets from the Roblox website, typically the
  `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset` function.

  To load an asset, the asset must be accessible by the creator of the game
  loading it, which can be either a user or group. Due to these restrictions,
  InsertService is useful for loading sensitive data, typically API or secret
  keys to be used with `Class.HttpService`. Should a game be uploaded by a
  different creator, the sensitive data would not be accessible. See the
  `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset` function for more details on this
  security check.

    want to load using InsertService

      Retrieves a list of Free Decals from the Catalog.
    description: |
      The GetFreeDecals function retrieves a list of Free `Class.Decal`s from
      the Catalog. The return type for this method is very odd, as it returns a
      single table wrapped in a table.

      The best way to explain it is to show a visual of the array returned:

      ```lua
      [1] = {
      	CurrentStartIndex = 1, -- This can vary depending on the page you input.
      	TotalCount = 21, -- Always 21.
      	Results = {
      		-- All parameters here are pseudo. They can vary depending on the asset.
      		[1] = {
      			Name = "Asset Name",
      			AssetId = 0000000,
      			AssetVersionId = 0000000,
      			CreatorName = "Roblox",
      		},
      		-- [2], [3], and so on... up to [21]
      	},
      }
      ```

      Yikes! That quite confusing. Unfortunately this method was added in the
      earlier days of Roblox, where easy to understand return-types weren't a
      priority.

      Thankfully, an example for iterating over this list has been provided at
      the bottom of this page.

      Additionally, if you want to insert `Class.Model|Models` instead, you can
      use the `Class.InsertService:GetFreeModels()` function.

      _Note:_ The page argument starts at 0. So Page 1 = 0, Page 2 = 1, etc.

      can use the `Class.InsertService:GetFreeDecals()` function.

    summary: |
      Returns a `Class.Model` containing the asset.
    description: |
      The LoadAsset function fetches an asset given its ID and returns a
      `Class.Model` containing the asset. For example, to load this public
      [Doge](https://www.roblox.com/library/257489726/Doge) `Class.Model`, which
      has the asset ID **_257489726_**, you can use:

      ```lua
      local assetId = 257489726
      local InsertService = game:GetService("InsertService")
      local model = InsertService:LoadAsset(assetId)
      model.Parent = workspace
      ```

      Calls to this function may fail if a server providing a model is having
      problems. As such, it's generally a good idea to wrap calls to this
      function in `pcall` to catch these kinds of errors.

      ```lua
      local assetId = 257489726
      local InsertService = game:GetService("InsertService")
      local success, model = pcall(InsertService.LoadAsset, InsertService, assetId)
      if success and model then
         print("Model loaded successfully")
         model.Parent = workspace
      else
         print("Model failed to load!")
      end
      ```

      #### Security Check

      An asset loaded by this function must be **created or owned** by either
      the game creator or Roblox. Additionally, benign asset types such as
      t-shirts, shirts, pants and avatar accessories are loadable from any game
      as they are public.
