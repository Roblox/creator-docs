  Used to insert assets from the Roblox website.
description: |
  InsertService is used to insert assets from the Roblox website, typically the
  `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset` function.

  To load an asset, it must be accessible by the creator of the experience
  loading it, which can be either a user or group. Should an experience be
  uploaded by a different creator, the asset data would not be accessible. See
  the `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()|LoadAsset()` method for more details on
  this security check. Note that you should **not** use this service for loading
  API keys or other secrets. Use `Class.HttpService:GetSecret()` instead.

    want to load using InsertService

  - name: InsertService:GetFreeDecalsAsync
    summary: |
      Retrieves a list of free Decals from the Catalog.
    description: |
      The GetFreeDecalsAsync function retrieves a list of free
      `Class.Decal|Decals` from the Catalog. The return type for this method is
      very odd, as it returns a single table wrapped in a table.

      The best way to explain it is to show a visual of the array returned:

      ```lua
      [1] = {
      	CurrentStartIndex = 1, -- This can vary depending on the page you input.
      	TotalCount = 21, -- Always 21.
      	Results = {
      		-- All parameters here are pseudo. They can vary depending on the asset.
      		[1] = {
      			Name = "Asset Name",
      			AssetId = 0000000,
      			AssetVersionId = 0000000,
      			CreatorName = "Roblox",
      		},
      		-- [2], [3], and so on... up to [21]
      	},
      }
      ```

      An example for iterating over this list has been provided at the bottom of
      this page.

      Additionally, if you want to insert `Class.Model|Models` instead, you can
      use the `Class.InsertService:GetFreeModelsAsync()` function.

      _Note:_ The page argument starts at 0. So Page 1 = 0, Page 2 = 1, etc.

    capabilities: []
  - name: InsertService:LoadAsset
    summary: |
      Returns a `Class.Model` containing the asset.
    description: |
      The LoadAsset function fetches an asset given its ID and returns a
      `Class.Model` containing the asset. For example, to load this public
      [Doge](https://www.roblox.com/library/257489726/Doge) `Class.Model`, which
      has the asset ID **_257489726_**, you can use:

      ```lua
      local InsertService = game:GetService("InsertService")
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local assetId = 257489726
      local model = InsertService:LoadAsset(assetId)
      model.Parent = Workspace
      ```

      Calls to this function may fail if a server providing a model is having
      problems. As such, it's generally a good idea to wrap calls to this
      function in `pcall` to catch these kinds of errors.

      ```lua
      local InsertService = game:GetService("InsertService")
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local assetId = 257489726

      local success, model = pcall(InsertService.LoadAsset, InsertService, assetId)
      if success and model then
      	print("Model loaded successfully")
      	model.Parent = Workspace
      else
      	print("Model failed to load!")
      end
      ```

      #### Security Check

      An asset loaded by this function must meet one of the following:

      - The asset must be **created or owned** by the game creator.
      - The asset must be **shared** by the asset owner.
      - The asset must be owned by Roblox.

      Additionally, benign asset types such as t-shirts, shirts, pants and
      avatar accessories are loadable from any game as they are `OpenUse`.

      To load assets which do not meet the above criteria, such as free Models
      published on the Store, you must use `Class.AssetService:LoadAssetAsync()`
      and enable `Class.AssetService.AllowInsertFreeAssets`.

      See also:

      - `Class.AssetService:GetBundleDetailsAsync()`, to find out which assets
        are associated with a bundle.
