type: class
category: Joints
memory_category: PhysicsParts
summary: |
  Holds two parts together and functions identically to `Class.Weld`.
description: |
  An object that holds two objects rigidly together. Most commonly created when
  `Class.BasePart:MakeJoints()` is called on parts where Inlet and Stud
  `Enum.SurfaceType` are touching.

  Functionally identical to `Class.Weld`.

  See also `Class.WeldConstraint` for a newer alternative using the
  [constraints](../../../physics/mechanical-constraints.md) system that does not
  require `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0` or `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` properties
  to be manually set.

  ## Root part

  Every Assembly has a root part, see `Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()`. When a
  Snap's `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0`/`Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` is modified the
  root part will stay where it was.

  ## Directionality

  Snaps do not have any directionality. `Class.JointInstance.Part0|Part0` or
  `Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1`, doesn't matter. You can imagine rigid
  joints forming a tree branching down from the root part. All the parts down
  the tree from root will move, and their welded "children" in this tree will
  move with them.
