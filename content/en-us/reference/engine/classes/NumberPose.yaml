  A NumberPose holds the value applied to a specific FACS control. The control
  which is affected depends on the name of the NumberPose.

  NumberPoses are the building blocks of facial animation and, with
  `Class.Keyframe|Keyframes`, make up `Class.KeyframeSequence`s.

  ## NumberPoses and Facial Animation

  Although a NumberPose is assigned to a single FACS control by name, that
  control can in turn affect multiple bones of the face rig. FACS controls act
  as an abstraction layer between facial muscle movements and how they are
  defined in the rig.

  ## NumberPose and hierarchy

  Contrary to `Class.Pose` Instances, `Class.NumberPose|NumberPoses` cannot be
  parented together. However, they all must be stored in a `Class.Folder` named
  'FaceControls' that is a child of the 'Head' `Class.Pose`.

  ## NumberPose value

  The Roblox animation system applies `Class.NumberPose` values to the
  corresponding FACS controls. Because those controls only respond to values
  between 0 and 1, the values calculated by the animation system are always
  clamped to that range.
