  A **NumberPose** holds the value applied to a specific FACS control. The
  control which is affected depends on its name.

  **NumberPose** instances are the building blocks of facial animation and, with
  `Class.Keyframe|Keyframes`, make up
  `Class.KeyframeSequence|KeyframeSequences`.

  #### NumberPoses and Facial Animation

  Although a **NumberPose** is assigned to a single FACS control by name, that
  control can in turn affect multiple bones of the face rig. FACS controls act
  as an abstraction layer between facial muscle movements and how they are
  defined in the rig.

  #### NumberPose Hierarchy

  Contrary to `Class.Pose` Instances, **NumberPose** instances cannot be
  parented together. However, they all must be stored in a `Class.Folder` named
  **FaceControls** that is a child of the **Head** `Class.Pose`.

  #### NumberPose Value

  The Roblox animation system applies **NumberPose** values to the corresponding
  FACS controls. Because those controls only respond to values between 0 and 1,
  the values calculated by the animation system are always clamped to that
  range.
