    summary: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.Color3Value.Value` is changed.
    description: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.Color3Value.Value` of the `Class.Color3Value` is
      changed. It will run with the new value being stored in the argument
      object, instead of a string representing the property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      Color3Value changes and to track the different values that it may change
      to.

      For instance, this may be useful in games that rely on Color3Values to
      track values such as colors for games using customizable outfits or items.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
