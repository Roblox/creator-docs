  Abstract class for all objects that have a physical location in the world.

    summary: |
      Gets the pivot of a `Class.PVInstance`.
    description: |
      This function gets the pivot of a `Class.PVInstance`. This is often used
      with `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()` to move a model.

      `Class.Model|Models` and `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are both
      `Class.PVInstance|PVInstances` ("Position Velocity Instances") and so both
      have this function.

  - name: PVInstance:PivotTo
    summary: |
      Transforms the `Class.PVInstance` along with all of its descendant
      `Class.PVInstance|PVInstances` such that the pivot is now located at the
      specified `Datatype.CFrame`.
    description: |
      Transforms the `Class.PVInstance` along with all of its descendant
      `Class.PVInstance|PVInstances` such that the pivot is now located at the
      specified `Datatype.CFrame`. This is the primary function that should be
      used to move `Class.Model|Models` via scripting.

      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are moved in this way by having their
      `Datatype.CFrame` transformed by the necessary offset.
      `Class.Model|Models` are moved in this way by having their
      `Class.Model.WorldPivot` transformed by the necessary offset.

      Note that for efficiency purposes, `Class.Object.Changed` events are not
      fired for `Class.BasePart.Position|Position` and
      `Class.BasePart.Orientation|Orientation` of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
      moved in this way; they are only fired for `Datatype.CFrame`.

      When calling `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()|PivotTo` on `Class.Model|Models`,
      the offsets of the descendant parts and models are cached, such that
      subsequent calls to `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()|PivotTo` on the same model
      do not accumulate floating point drift between the parts making up the
      model.

      `Class.Model|Models` and `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` are both
      `Class.PVInstance|PVInstances` ("Position Velocity Instances") and so both
      have this function.
