description: |
  The **LineForce** constraint applies a force along the theoretical line
  connecting its two `Class.Attachment|Attachments`. As the end points
  (attachments) move, the direction of force will change accordingly.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Force Location

  By default, force is applied to either parent at its attachment location. If
  desired, force can be focused at each parent's center of mass by enabling
  `Class.LineForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass`.

  #### Inverse Square Law

  When `Class.LineForce.InverseSquareLaw|InverseSquareLaw` is true, the force
  magnitude is multiplied by the inverse square of the distance, meaning the
  force will increase exponentially as the two attachments get closer together,
  like magnets. When using this setting, it's recommended that you set a
  `Class.LineForce.MaxForce|MaxForce` threshold to prevent infinite force if the
  attachments align precisely.

  #### Reactionary Force

  By default, the constraint only applies force to
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`, while
  `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` remains unaffected. However, force
  can be applied to both attachments in **equal and opposite directions** by
  enabling `Class.LineForce.ReactionForceEnabled|ReactionForceEnabled`.

      Whether force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly.
    description: |
      When true, force is applied at the center of mass of the parent assembly
      of `Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0`, and the line determining the
      direction of the force will start at the said center of mass. When false,
      force is applied at `Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0` and the line
      determining the direction will also start at
      `Class.LineForce.Attachment0|Attachment0`.

    description: |
      The maximum absolute force that can be applied. This property is enabled
      only when `Class.LineForce.InverseSquareLaw|InverseSquareLaw` is also
      enabled. This property is mainly used to address the issue that the force
      of the body mover becomes infinite the closer the two attachments are,
      causing explosions that can't be prevented by scripts. This property
      bounds the force's absolute value.

      Enables a reaction force (equal an opposite) to be applied to the parent
      of `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1`. By default line force only
      applies a force on the parent of
      `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` and uses
      `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` as the target direction without
      any dynamic relationship.
