  An object, such as a weapon, that can be equipped by a `Class.Humanoid`.
description: |
  Tools are objects that a `Class.Humanoid` object can equip. For players, they
  are stored in a `Class.Backpack` object parented to a `Class.Player` object.
  In-game, players may have multiple tools which appear as icons at the bottom
  of the screen. Equipping a tool moves it from the Backpack and into a
  `Class.Player.Character` model in the `Class.Workspace`. By default, tools are
  held in the right hand and have a handle in them, which is a
  `Class.BasePart|Part` named "Handle" inside (though one isn't required if
  `Class.Tool.RequiresHandle` is off). Tools that are to be provided to
  (re)spawning players ought to be stored in the `Class.StarterPack`.

  On desktop, pressing a number key (1, 2, 3...) will equip a tool. Equipped
  tools can be dropped into the Workspace by pressing Backspace. It's
  recommended that you turn `Class.Tool.CanBeDropped` off so it isn't possible
  to drop a tool, die, respawn and drop again to duplicate tools. On gamepads,
  LB and RB buttons will equip tools. You can disable activation via left click
  (or right trigger on gamepad) by setting `Class.Tool.ManualActivationOnly` on.
  Doing so requires that you call Activate yourself through some sort of other
  user input.

  Tools aren't the only way to capture user input. You can also use
  `Class.ContextActionService`, `Class.UserInputService` or
  `Class.Player:GetMouse()`. If you need a Tool to have multiple actions, such
  as pressing a key while the Tool is equipped, you should use
  ContextActionService's `Class.ContextActionService:BindAction()|BindAction`
  and `Class.ContextActionService:UnbindAction()|UnbindAction` in the
  `Class.Tool.Equipped|Equipped` and `Class.Tool.Unequipped|Unequipped` events,
  respectively. Use a `Class.LocalScript` send these actions to the server via a
  `Class.RemoteFunction` inside the Tool.

      The CanBeDropped property controls whether the player can drop the
      `Class.Tool`.

      If true, when the backspace button is pressed, the tool will be parented
      to `Class.Workspace` and removed from the player's `Class.Backpack`. If
      false, nothing will happen when backspace is pressed, and the tool will
      remain equipped.

      The **Enabled** property relates to whether or not the `Class.Tool` can be
      used. This is useful if you want to prevent a player from using a tool,
      but don't want to remove it from their `Class.Backpack`.

      When set to `true`, the player can use the tool. When set to `false`, the
      tool is disabled and the player cannot use it; this prevents the tool from
      being activated or deactivated by the `Class.Tool:Activate()` and
      `Class.Tool:Deactivate()` methods, and it prevents the
      `Class.Tool.Activated` and `Class.Tool.Deactivated` events from firing.

      In order to change a tool's grip properties, you must either use a

    description: |
      This property determines whether a `Class.Tool` functions without a
      handle.

      A tool has a handle when it contains a child part named **Handle**. Tools
      with handles typically require the player equipping them to hold an object
      to use them, for instance weapons. Tools without handles typically don't
      require the player equipping them to hold anything to use them, for
      instance "fly" or "summon" tools.

      When set to `true`, the tool will function only with a handle. When set to
      `false`, the tool will function even without a handle.
