type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  An object, such as a weapon, that can be equipped by a `Class.Humanoid`.
description: |
  A `Tool` is an object that a `Class.Humanoid` object can equip. For players,
  they are stored in a `Class.Backpack` object parented to a `Class.Player`
  object. In-experience, players may have multiple tools which appear as icons
  at the bottom of the screen. Equipping a tool moves it from the
  `Class.Backpack` and into a `Class.Player.Character` model in the
  `Class.Workspace`. By default, tools are held in the right hand and have a
  handle in them, which is a `Class.BasePart` named `Handle` inside (although
  one isn't required if `Class.Tool.RequiresHandle` is `false`). Tools that are
  to be provided to (re)spawning players should be stored in the
  `Class.StarterPack`.

    summary: |
      Controls whether the player can drop the tool.
    description: |
      The CanBeDropped property controls whether the player can drop the
      `Class.Tool`.

      If true, when the backspace button is pressed, the tool will be parented
      to `Class.Workspace` and removed from the player's `Class.Backpack`. If
      false, nothing will happen when backspace is pressed, and the tool will
      remain equipped.

    description: |
      The **Enabled** property relates to whether or not the `Class.Tool` can be
      used. This is useful if you want to prevent a player from using a tool,
      but don't want to remove it from their `Class.Backpack`.

      When set to `true`, the player can use the tool. When set to `false`, the
      tool is disabled and the player cannot use it; this prevents the tool from
      being activated or deactivated by the `Class.Tool:Activate()` and
      `Class.Tool:Deactivate()` methods, and it prevents the
      `Class.Tool.Activated` and `Class.Tool.Deactivated` events from firing.

      This property controls whether the `Class.Tool` can be activated without
      explicitly executing `Class.Tool:Activate()` in a script.

      When set to `true`, the tool will only fire `Class.Tool.Activated` when
      `Class.Tool:Activate()` is called. This also suppresses the
      `Class.ContextActionService:BindActivate()` function.

      When set to `false`, mouse clicks (when the tool is equipped) will also
      fire `Class.Tool.Activated`.

    summary: |
      Determines whether a `Class.Tool` functions without a handle.
    description: |
      This property determines whether a `Class.Tool` functions without a
      handle.

      A tool has a handle when it contains a child part named **Handle**. Tools
      with handles typically require the player equipping them to hold an object
      to use them, for instance weapons. Tools without handles typically don't
      require the player equipping them to hold anything to use them, for
      instance "fly" or "summon" tools.

      When set to `true`, the tool will function only with a handle. When set to
      `false`, the tool will function even without a handle.

      The ToolTip property controls the message that will be displayed when the
      player's `Class.Mouse` hovers over the `Class.Tool` in their
      `Class.Backpack`.

      Generally, the value of this property should describe the what the tool is
      or its use. For instance, for a shovel tool, you may choose to set the
      ToolTip to:

      ```lua
      tool.ToolTip = "Shovel"
      ```

      or

      ```lua
      tool.ToolTip = "Use to dig"
      ```

      or

      ```lua
      tool.ToolTip = "Shovel - Use to dig"

      This event fires when the player clicks while the `Class.Tool` is
      equipped. It is **not** fired if the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key is pressed during

      This event is typically used to perform an action when the player uses the
      tool, for instance to launch a rocket from a rocket launcher weapon tool.

      The below code, when placed in a `Class.LocalScript`, creates a tool in
      the local player's `Class.Backpack` and prints "Tool activated" when the
      player clicks while the created tool is equipped.

      tool.RequiresHandle = false
      tool.Parent = Players.LocalPlayer.Backpack
