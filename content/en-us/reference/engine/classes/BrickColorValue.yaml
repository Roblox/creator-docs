      Fired whenever the `Class.BrickColorValue.Value` of the BrickColorValue is
      changed.
    description: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.BrickColorValue.Value` of the
      `Class.BrickColorValue` is changed. It will run with the new value being
      stored in the argument object, instead of a string representing the
      property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      BrickColorValue changes and to track the different values that it may
      change to.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
