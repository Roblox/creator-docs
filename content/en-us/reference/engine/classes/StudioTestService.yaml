  Service allowing plugins to automate and customize Test and Run mode testing.
description: |
  `StudioTestService` allows plugins to automate and customize Test and Run mode
  testing. With StudioTestService, your plugins can launch tests that jump
  straight to a specific part of your game, or run complex code tests
  automatically.

  The following is an example of automated unit testing:

  ```lua
  --Plugin Script
  local StudioTestService = game:GetService("StudioTestService")

  local testResult = StudioTestService:ExecuteRunModeAsync("MyTestSuite")
  print("Test finished. Result:", testResult)
  ```

  ```lua
  --Server Script
  local StudioTestService = game:GetService("StudioTestService")
  local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

  if not RunService:IsStudio() or not RunService:IsRunMode() then
  	return
  end

  local suiteName = StudioTestService:GetTestArgs()
  if suiteName then
      local tests = getTestsArrayByName(SuiteName)
      if tests then
          local result = "SUCCESS!"
          for name, test in tests do
              if not pcall(test) then
                  result = name .. " failed!"
                  break
              end
          end
          StudioTestService:EndTest(result)
      else
          StudioTestService:EndTest("Suite not found")
      end
  else
  	print("Starting manual playtest")
  end
  ```

      Ends the current Studio test session if called from the server
      `Class.DataModel`, even if the test was not started by this service.

      If the test was started by
      `Class.StudioTestService:ExecutePlayModeAsync()` or
      `Class.StudioTestService:ExecuteRunModeAsync()`, the value passed here is
      returned by that method.

      This method returns immediately and ends the test session asynchronously.
      It errors if called from any `Class.DataModel` other than that of the
      server during a running Studio test session.

      Starts a solo **Test** session and yields until that session ends.

      The `args` parameter can be retrieved using
      `Class.StudioTestService:GetTestArgs()`. Returns the value passed to
      `Class.StudioTestService:EndTest()`, or `nil` if the test ended by other
      means.

      This method errors if a test session is already running.
