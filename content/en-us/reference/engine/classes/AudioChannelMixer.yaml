name: AudioChannelMixer
type: class
memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  Combines multiple audio streams into a single, multichannel audio stream.
description: |
  `Class.AudioChannelMixer` mixes multiple audio streams into a single,
  multichannel stream. It provides one combined **Input** pin, one **Output**
  pin, as well as the following secondary input pins, all of which can be
  connected to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`: **Left**, **Right**, **Center**,
  **SurroundLeft**, **SurroundRight**, **Sub**, **BackLeft**, **BackRight**,
  **TopLeft**, **TopRight**, **TopBackLeft**, and **TopBackRight**.

      Controls the output channel layout to be mixed to.
    description: |
      Controls the output channel layout to be mixed to. The **Input** pin of
      `Class.AudioChannelMixer` is always forwarded "as-is" to **Output**, but
      depending on the value of `Layout`:

      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Mono|Mono`, the **Center** pin consumes
        audio streams.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Stereo|Stereo`, the **Left** and **Right**
        pins consume audio streams.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Quad|Quad`, the **Left**, **Right**,
        **BackLeft**, and **BackRight** pins consume audio streams.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_5|Surround_5` is the same as `Quad`,
        plus **Center** consumes an audio stream.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_5_1|Surround_5_1` is the same as
        `Surround_5`, plus **Sub** consumes an audio stream.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_7_1|Surround_7_1` is the same as
        `Surround_5_1`, plus **SurroundLeft** and **SurroundRight** consume
        audio streams.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_7_1_4|Surround_7_1_4`, all
        secondary input pins consume audio streams.
