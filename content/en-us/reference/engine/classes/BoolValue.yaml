name: BoolValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a single boolean value.
description: |
  Stores a single boolean value. The value can be used for many things,
  including to communicate between scripts.

  Like all `Class.ValueBase` objects, this single value is stored in the
  `Class.BoolValue.Value|Value` property. The `Changed` event fires with the new
  value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

      Fires whenever the `Class.BoolValue.Value` changes. It runs with the new
      value being stored in the argument object, instead of a string
      representing the property being changed.

      Listening for the `Changed` signal can be useful in games that use
      `BoolValues` to track switch or enabled states.
