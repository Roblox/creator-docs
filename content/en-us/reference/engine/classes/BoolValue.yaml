summary: |
  A container object for a single boolean value.
description: |
  An instance which is used to hold a boolean value. The value can be used for
  many things, including to communicate between scripts.

events:
  - name: BoolValue.Changed
    summary: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.BoolValue.Value` of the BoolValue is changed.
    description: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.BoolValue.Value` of the `Class.BoolValue` is
      changed. It will run with the new value being stored in the argument
      object, instead of a string representing the property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      BoolValue changes and to track the different values that it may change to.

      For instance, this may be useful in games that rely on BoolValues to track
      game states and values, such as switch or enabled states.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
