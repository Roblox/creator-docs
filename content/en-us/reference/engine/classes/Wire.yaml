  `Class.Wire` connects one or more `Class.Instance|Instances` to form a
  processing graph of their streams. Each `Class.Wire` connects a source and
  target instance, and a source and target "pin" within each of those instances.
  Pins are string identifiers that select which stream is to be carried by the
  wire.

  At the moment, only audio streams are supported, but this may expand in the
  future.

  The following instances may be connected by `Class.Wire|Wires`:

  - `Class.AudioAnalyzer`
  - `Class.AudioCompressor`
  - `Class.AudioDeviceInput`
  - `Class.AudioDeviceOutput`
  - `Class.AudioDistortion`
  - `Class.AudioEcho`
  - `Class.AudioEmitter`
  - `Class.AudioEqualizer`
  - `Class.AudioFader`
  - `Class.AudioFlanger`
  - `Class.AudioListener`
  - `Class.AudioPitchShifter`
  - `Class.AudioPlayer`
  - `Class.AudioReverb`

      Denotes whether the `Class.Wire` is connected, meaning its
      `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance`,
      `Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance`,
      `Class.Wire.SourceName|SourceName`, and `Class.Wire.TargetName|TargetName`
      properties are all assigned, the connection is valid, and the connection
      does not result in a cyclic processing graph. Cyclic processing graphs are
      invalid since they can result in infinite computation; attempting to
      create one will log an error.

      The name of the pin on `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance` that is
      producing a stream. At the moment, various audio instances only have an
      **Output** pin, but this may expand in the future. The default value of
      this property is **Output** so it is not yet necessary to change.
