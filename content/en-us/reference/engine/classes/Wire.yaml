  `Class.Wire` connects one or more `Class.Instance|Instances` to form a
  processing graph of their streams. Each `Class.Wire` connects a source and
  target instance, and a source and target "pin" within each of those instances.
  Pins are string identifiers that select which stream is to be carried by the
  wire.

  At the moment, only audio streams are supported, but this may expand in the
  future.

  The following instances may be connected by `Class.Wire|Wires`:

  - `Class.AudioAnalyzer`
  - `Class.AudioChannelMixer`
  - `Class.AudioChannelSplitter`
  - `Class.AudioCompressor`
  - `Class.AudioDeviceInput`
  - `Class.AudioDeviceOutput`
  - `Class.AudioDistortion`
  - `Class.AudioEcho`
  - `Class.AudioEmitter`
  - `Class.AudioEqualizer`
  - `Class.AudioFader`
  - `Class.AudioFilter`
  - `Class.AudioFlanger`
  - `Class.AudioLimiter`
  - `Class.AudioListener`
  - `Class.AudioPitchShifter`
  - `Class.AudioPlayer`
  - `Class.AudioRecorder`
  - `Class.AudioReverb`
  - `Class.AudioSpeechToText`
  - `Class.AudioTextToSpeech`

      Denotes whether the `Class.Wire` is connected, meaning its
      `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance`,
      `Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance`,
      `Class.Wire.SourceName|SourceName`, and `Class.Wire.TargetName|TargetName`
      properties are all assigned, the corresponding
      `Class.Wire.SourceName|SourceName` and `Class.Wire.TargetName|TargetName`
      pins exist on `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance` and
      `Class.Wire.TargetInstance|TargetInstance` respectively, and the
      connection does not result in a cyclic processing graph.

      The name of the pin on `Class.Wire.SourceInstance|SourceInstance` that is

      **Output** pin, but this may expand in the future. The default value of
      this property is **Output** so it is not yet necessary to change.

      pin. This may expand in the future.
