  A container object that holds a `Class.Player`'s inventory. Any `Class.Tool`
  in a player's Backpack will be displayed in their inventory at the bottom of
  their screen. Selecting `Class.Tool`s from the inventory will equip the
  `Class.Tool`, moving it from the Backpack to the player's character.

  The Backpack can also store `Class.Script|Scripts` and
  `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, which run when placed in a player's
  Backpack.

  When a player's character spawns, the contents of the `Class.StarterPack` and
  their `Class.StarterGear` are copied into their Backpack. Once a character
  dies, the Backpack is removed and a new one will be created -- populating it
  with the contents of `Class.StarterPack` and `Class.StarterGear`.

  Roblox provides an interface for a player to access their backpack and
  inventory by default at the bottom of the screen. If a developer wishes to
  disable the default Roblox backpack GUI and replace it with their own, they
  may do so using `Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled()`.

  The Backpack can be accessed from both the client and the server.

  ```lua
  -- Accessing Backpack from a Server Script:
  game.Players.PlayerName.Backpack

  -- Accessing Backpack from a LocalScript:
  game.Players.LocalPlayer.Backpack
  ```
