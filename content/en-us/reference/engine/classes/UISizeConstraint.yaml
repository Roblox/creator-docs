  Ensures a `Class.GuiObject` does not become larger or smaller than the
  constraint's maximum size or minimum size.
description: |
  The `Class.UISizeConstraint` ensures a `Class.GuiObject` does not become
  larger or smaller than the `Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize|MaxSize` and
  `Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize`. For example, if
  `Class.UISizeConstraint.MaxSize|MaxSize` is set to
  <Typography noWrap>`(200, 200)`</Typography> and
  `Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize` to <Typography
  noWrap>`(100, 100)`</Typography>, the constrained object cannot scale to be
  larger than 200&times;200 pixels or smaller than 100&times;100 pixels.

  Note that if the object with this constraint is also under the control of a
  `Class.UILayout` such as `Class.UIGridLayout`, the **constraint** determines
  the object's minimum/maximum size and overwrites any size the layout would
  apply.
