      an arrow drawn in 3D, facing the surface that the contact point is
      detecting.

      #### Solver Variations

      The behavior of this property varies depending on whether Roblox's physics
      engine is using the `PGS Physics Solver`, or the `Spring Physics Solver`.

      This is controlled by the `Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled`
      property.

      ##### Spring Physics Solver

      When `Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled` is set to false, the
      contact points are color coded as listed below. The length of the arrow
      extruding from the sphere depends on how much force the contact point is
      exerting, and what the contact type is.

      <table>
      	<tbody><tr>
      		<th width="50">Color</th>
      		<th width="200">Contact Type</th>
      		<th>Description</th>
      	</tr>

      		<td bgcolor="#CCCC00"></td>

      	<tr>
      		<td bgcolor="#656500"></td>
      		<td>Resting Contact</td>
      		<td>Contact point that has been active for at least 4 frames.</td>
      	</tr>
      	<tr>
      		<td bgcolor="#CC0000"></td>
      		<td>Second Pass Contact</td>
      		<td>Contact point that was made by a kernel joint going through a second pass. Rarely seen.</td>
      	</tr>
      	<tr>
      		<td bgcolor="#CC6500"></td>
      		<td>Real Time Contact</td>
      		<td>Contact point that was made with a real-time physics body. This applies to tripped <code>Class.Humanoid</code>.</td>
      	</tr>
      	<tr>
      		<td bgcolor="#0000CC"></td>
      		<td>Joint Contact</td>
      		<td>Contact point that was made under the context of a physically simulated joint. This applies to Motors and Hinges.</td>
      	</tr>
      </tbody></table>
      <b>PGS Physics Solver</b>

      When `Class.Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled` is set to true, the contact
      points are always colored **RED**, and the length of the arrow will always
      be 1 stud. There are no special conditions tracked, because the PGS solver
      does not keep specific lookup tables for the states listed in the Spring
      Solver.

      Controls the throttle rate of Roblox's physics engine. By default, the
      physics engine will adjust the physics environment throttle depending on
      how much work the physics engine is doing, and the current framerate. See
      the enum page for `Enum.EnviromentalPhysicsThrottle` for more information.
