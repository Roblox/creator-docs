  Stores the result of paths created by `Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()`.
description: |
  **Path** objects store the result of paths created by
  `Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()`.

  Once a path object is created, you can call `Class.Path:ComputeAsync()` with a
  starting point and ending point. This will attempt to compute a valid path for
  a character to move along, based on default or custom parameters passed to
  `Class.PathfindingService:CreatePath()|CreatePath()`. If
  `Class.Path:ComputeAsync()|ComputeAsync()` successfully finds a path, the
  `Class.Path` object will have a `Class.Path.Status` value of
  `Enum.PathStatus.Success`. Otherwise the status will be
  `Enum.PathStatus.NoPath` which can occur if there are obstacles between the
  two points (and no way around) or if the points are inside of solid objects.

  In addition to `Class.Path:ComputeAsync()|ComputeAsync()`, `Class.Path`
  objects have the `Class.Path:GetWaypoints()|GetWaypoints()` method which
  returns a list of waypoints representing the points a character should follow
  in sequence to get from the beginning to the end of the path.

  Finally, `Class.Path` objects can be **connected** to the `Class.Path.Blocked`
  event. This event will fire if, at any time during the path's existence, the
  path is blocked. Note that this can occur **behind** a character moving along
  the path, not just in front of it.

      This function checks if a path is blocked starting at the waypoint
      indicated by **start**.

      It returns the first waypoint of occlusion if blocked, -1 if not. it
      returns an error if **start** is less than 0 or greater than the number of
      waypoints in the `Class.Path`.

    description: |
      This function computes a `Class.Path` from a start position to an end
      position. This function is not automatically called when a path is created
      and must be invoked each time the path needs to be updated.

      Once the Path is computed, it will have a series of waypoints that, when
      followed, can lead a character along the path. These points are gathered
      with the `Class.Path:GetWaypoints()` function.

      This function returns an array of all the

      `Class.Path:ComputeAsync()`.

      Each waypoint in the array specifies a `Datatype.Vector3` position and
      `Enum.PathWaypointAction|action` to take when this PathWaypoint is
      reached. The array is arranged in the order of waypoints from the path
      start to path end.

      If a path could not be computed, this function will return an empty array.
