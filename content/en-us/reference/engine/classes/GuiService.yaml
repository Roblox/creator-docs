      If activated, the <kbd>Select</kbd> button on a gamepad or
      <kbd>Backslash</kbd> will automatically set a GUI as the selected object.
      Disabling this means that GUI navigation will still work if
      `Class.GuiService.GuiNavigationEnabled|GuiNavigationEnabled` is enabled,
      but you will have to set `Class.GuiService.SelectedObject|SelectedObject`
      manually to start navigation.

    summary: |
      Gets the player's preferred text size as an `Enum.PreferredTextSize`
      value.
    description: |
      Gets the player's preferred text size as an `Enum.PreferredTextSize` value
      of `Enum.PreferredTextSize.Medium|Medium` (default),
      `Enum.PreferredTextSize.Large|Large`,
      `Enum.PreferredTextSize.Larger|Larger`, or
      `Enum.PreferredTextSize.Largest|Largest`. This property maps to the
      **Text&nbsp;Size** setting available to players from the Roblox and
      in‑game **Settings** menus, and it can be combined with
      `Class.Object.GetPropertyChangedSignal()` to detect text size setting
      changes for purposes of adjusting UI.

      When working with UI elements, note the following behaviors:

      - Text that is constrained to a minimum and/or maximum size through a
        `Class.UITextSizeConstraint` will **not** shrink below or expand above
        the set
        `Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MinTextSize|MinTextSize`/`Class.UITextSizeConstraint.MaxTextSize|MaxTextSize`,
        regardless of the player's text size setting.

      - When `Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextScaled` is enabled for a
        `Class.TextLabel.TextScaled|TextLabel` or
        `Class.TextButton.TextScaled|TextButton`, the element's text will
        **not** be scaled by the
        `Class.GuiService.PreferredTextSize|PreferredTextSize` value.

      - UI elements with `Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize` enabled
        will shrink/grow as
        `Class.GuiService.PreferredTextSize|PreferredTextSize`
        decreases/increases (element bounds will resize to fit the resized
        text).

      - When `Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped|TextWrapped` is enabled for a
        `Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped|TextLabel` or
        `Class.TextButton.TextWrapped|TextButton`, the element's text will wrap
        to additional lines as
        `Class.GuiService.PreferredTextSize|PreferredTextSize` increases, within
        limits of the element's absolute size.

      - The results returned by `Class.TextService:GetTextSize()` and
        `Class.TextService:GetTextBoundsAsync()` honor changes related to
        `Class.GuiService.PreferredTextSize|PreferredTextSize`.

      Gets the player's preferred transparency as a number between `0` and `1`.
      This property maps to the **Background&nbsp;Transparency** setting
      available to players from the Roblox and in‑experience **Settings** menus,
      and it can be combined with `Class.Object.GetPropertyChangedSignal()` to
      detect transparency setting changes for purposes of adjusting UI.

      A value of `1` (default) indicates the player prefers the default
      background transparency, while a value of `0` indicates the player prefers
      fully opaque (non‑transparent) background transparency for improved
      readability and contrast. Multiplying a UI element's
      `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency|BackgroundTransparency` with
      `Class.GuiService.PreferredTransparency|PreferredTransparency` is the
      recommended approach, such that backgrounds become more opaque as
      `Class.GuiService.PreferredTransparency|PreferredTransparency` approaches
      `0`.

      Returns a `Datatype.Rect` object representing the unoccupied area between
      the Roblox left-most controls and the edge of the device safe area.

      The value is dynamic and can be expected to change based on the visibility
      of UI controls such as changing the local player's
      `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` property, usage of
      `Class.StarterGui:SetCoreGuiEnabled()`, changing the size and position of
      Roblox UI Controls, and/or others. For this reason, it's recommend that

      **AddSelectionTuple** works similarly to

      Beware that the second argument is _not_ a table, but rather the first of
      several `Class.GuiObject` in the tuple. To pass the contents of a table,
      use `unpack`/`table.unpack`:

      ```lua
      local frame = script.Parent
      -- Passing various GuiObject individually
      GuiService:AddSelectionTuple("InventoryButtons", frame.Sort, frame.Trash, frame.Drop)
