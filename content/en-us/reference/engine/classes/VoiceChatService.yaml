  **VoiceChatService** is responsible for voice chat's high-level functionality.

  specifically-controlled by more-specific instances.

      Controls whether each voice-eligible player can be heard as though they
      were speaking through their character.
    description: |
      When enabled, each voice-eligible player can be heard as though they were
      speaking through their character. The implementation details of the voice
      setup depend on `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi|UseAudioApi`.

      When `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi|UseAudioApi` is
      `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Enabled`, disabling this property disables the
      default setup, but `Class.AudioDeviceInput` will still work. Conversely,
      when `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi|UseAudioApi` is
      `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Disabled`, disabling the default voice setup
      effectively disables voice chat altogether.

      Controls whether voice chat is represented and controlled by
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput` objects.
    description: |
      If `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Enabled`, the voice chat setup is represented and
      controlled by `Class.AudioDeviceInput` objects. More specifically:

      - An `Class.AudioDeviceInput` will be created and parented to each
        voice-eligible `Class.Player`.
      - An `Class.AudioEmitter` will be created and parented to each
        voice-eligible player's `Class.Player.Character`.
      - An `Class.AudioListener` will be created and parented to
        `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.

      You can disable the default setup by setting
      `Class.VoiceChatService.EnableDefaultVoice` to `false`.

      If `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Disabled`, the voice chat setup is done through
      an internal-only system.

      Currently, setting this to `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Automatic` has the same
      meaning as `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Disabled`. However, in the future,
      `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Automatic` will become
      `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Enabled`, so that new experiences can achieve
      greater customization over voice.

      Returns whether or not the given user has voice enabled. On the
      client-side, this can only be used to check the voice status of the local
      player. On the server-side, this can only check the voice status for
      players in that server.

      This function can throw an error if the HTTP call fails.

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local VoiceChatService = game:GetService("VoiceChatService")

      local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
      local success, enabled = pcall(function()
      	return VoiceChatService:IsVoiceEnabledForUserIdAsync(localPlayer.UserId)
      end)
      if success and enabled then
      	print("Voice chat enabled!")
