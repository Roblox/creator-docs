      Indicates whether or not the place uses the default voice manager. This is
      on by default.

      When enabled, the default voice manager adds all voice-eligible users to
      chat with spatial voice as they join the place.

      When disabled, the place doesn't use the default voice manager, and users
      are not added to chat with spatial voice when they join the place.

    summary: |
      Returns whether or not the given user has voice enabled.
    description: |
      Returns whether or not the given user has voice enabled. On the
      client-side, this can only be used to check the voice status of the local
      player. On the server-side, this can only check the voice status for
      players in that server.

      This function can throw an error if the HTTP call fails.

      The following code sample enables a UI layer only for voice enabled
      players.

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local VoiceChatService = game:GetService("VoiceChatService")

      local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
      local success, enabled = pcall(function()
          return VoiceChatService:IsVoiceEnabledForUserIdAsync(localPlayer.UserId)
      end)
      if success and enabled then
          localPlayer.PlayerGui.MyVoiceGui.Enabled = true
      end

      ```
