  **VoiceChatService** is responsible for voice chat's high-level functionality.
  This mostly consists of configuration options, and functions that are not specifically-controlled by more-specific instances.

      Controls whether or not the default voice chat setup will be used.

      When enabled, each voice-eligible player can be heard as though they were speaking through their character.
      
      The behavior of the default voice setup depends on `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi|UseAudioApi`. 
      If `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Enabled`, this setup is represented and controlled by `Class.AudioDeviceInput`.
      More specifically:
      - An `Class.AudioDeviceInput` will be created and parented to each voice-eligible `Class.Player`.
      - An `Class.AudioEmitter` will be created and parented to each voice-eligible player's `Class.Player.Character`.
      - An `Class.AudioListener` will be created and parented to `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.
      
      If `Enum.AudioApiRollout|Disabled`, this setup is made by an internal-only system. 
      Using this system, disabling the default voice setup effectively disables voice altogether.

      Controls whether voice chat is implemented using the Audio API.

      Controls whether voice chat is implemented using the Audio API.
      When `Enabled`, the `Class.AudioDeviceInput` instance controls input from each player's microphone. 
      A default voice setup using this API can be turned on or off with `Class.VoiceChatService.EnableDefaultVoice`.
      
      When `Disabled`, an internal system controls the input from each player's microphone,
      and this system can be turned on or off in its entirety via `Class.VoiceChatService.EnableDefaultVoice`.
      
      Currently, `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi` being `Automatic` has the same meaning as `Disabled`.
      However, in the future, `Automatic` will become `Enabled`, so that new experiences can achieve greater customization over voice.

      Returns whether or not the given user has voice enabled.
    description: |
      Returns whether or not the given user has voice enabled. On the
      client-side, this can only be used to check the voice status of the local
      player. On the server-side, this can only check the voice status for
      players in that server.

      This function can throw an error if the HTTP call fails.

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local VoiceChatService = game:GetService("VoiceChatService")

      local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
      local success, enabled = pcall(function()
      	return VoiceChatService:IsVoiceEnabledForUserIdAsync(localPlayer.UserId)
      end)
      if success and enabled then
      	print("Voice chat enabled!")
      end
