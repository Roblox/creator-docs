name: ColorCorrectionEffect
type: class
category: Post Processing
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Adjusts color-related properties of the rendered world like saturation, tint,
  brightness, and contrast.
description: |
  The **ColorCorrectionEffect** can be used to adjust several color-related
  properties at once: `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Saturation|Saturation`,
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.TintColor|TintColor`,
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Brightness|Brightness` and
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Contrast|Contrast`. It's useful for fine-tuning
  the visual aesthetic of a world or communicating status effects to the player.
  Multiple **ColorCorrectionEffect** objects can be applied at once and they
  will compose their effects together.

  Like other post-processing effects, **ColorCorrectionEffect** will only work
  while `Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled` and when parented to `Class.Lighting`
  or `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. Also, it may render differently depending
  on your Studio settings (see the **Quality Level** settings in **Rendering**
  &rarr; **Performance**).

  For more details on this effect and others, see
  [Post-Processing Effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md).

    description: |
      Brightness determines by how much the colors of pixels will be shifted. A
      value of -1 will cause all pixels to be completely black while a value of
      1 will cause them to be white.

      Contrast determines the separation between the dark and light colors.
      Values less than 0 have reduced contrast while values greater than 0 have
      increased contrast.

      Determines the change in intensity of colors.
    description: |
      Saturation determines the change in intensity of pixel colors. Values
      above 1 will cause colors to be more vivid while values below 0 will make
      colors more dull, eventually reaching full desaturation at -1.

    summary: |
      Determines by how much the RGB channels of pixels are scaled.
    description: |
      Determines by what factors the RGB channels of pixel colors are scaled.
      The effect is multiplicative, so changing this to `[255, 0, 0]` (red)
      would cause the green and blue channels to be multiplied by 0.
