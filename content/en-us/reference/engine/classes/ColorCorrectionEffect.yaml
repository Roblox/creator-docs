name: ColorCorrectionEffect
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Adjusts color-related properties of the rendered world like saturation, tint,
  brightness, and contrast.
description: |
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect` can be used to adjust several color-related
  properties at once, including
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Saturation|Saturation`,
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.TintColor|TintColor`,
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Brightness|Brightness` and
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect.Contrast|Contrast`. It's useful for fine-tuning
  the visual aesthetic of a world or communicating status effects to the player.
  Multiple `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect` objects can be applied at the same time
  and they will compose their effects together.

  Like other
  [post-processing effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md),
  `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect` will only work while
  `Class.PostEffect.Enabled|Enabled` and when parented to `Class.Lighting` or
  `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. Also, it may render differently depending on
  your Studio settings (see **Editor&nbsp;Quality&nbsp;Level** in
  **Rendering**).

      Determines by how much the brightness of pixel colors will be shifted.
    description: |
      This property determines by how much the colors of pixels will be shifted.
      A value of `-1` will cause all pixels to be completely black while a value
      of `1` will cause them to be white.

    description: |
      This property determines the separation between the dark and light colors.
      Values less than `0` have reduced contrast while values greater than `0`
      have increased contrast.

    summary: |
      Determines the change in intensity of colors.
    description: |
      This property determines the change in intensity of pixel colors. Values
      above `1` will cause colors to be more vivid while values below `0` will
      make colors more dull, eventually reaching full desaturation at `-1`.

    summary: |
      Determines by how much the RGB channels of pixels are scaled.
    description: |
      This property determines by what factors the RGB channels of pixel colors
      are scaled. The effect is multiplicative, so changing this to <Typography
      noWrap>`[255, 0, 0]`</Typography> (red) would cause the green and blue
      channels to be multiplied by `0`.
