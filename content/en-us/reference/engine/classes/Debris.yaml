  The **Debris** service allows scheduling guaranteed destruction of an object
  without yielding.

  #### Advantages

  Besides creating a bit of a mess, objects that are no longer required can use
  up system memory and cause an experience to run slower over time. For this
  reason, it's always advised to call `Class.Instance:Destroy()` on objects you
  no longer need. In some cases, however, an object may have a specific period
  of utility before it can be destroyed.

  Consider a wall being smashed into individual bricks. If you want a brick to
  linger for 3 seconds before being destroyed, you can use the following code:

  ```lua
  task.wait(3)
  brick:Destroy()
  ```

  However, waiting causes the thread to yield which may be undesired. To avoid
  yielding, a callback function can be scheduled to run on a new thread after 3
  seconds:

  ```lua
  task.delay(3, function()
  	brick:Destroy()
  end)
  ```

  Or in one line:

  ```lua
  task.delay(3, brick.Destroy, brick)
  ```

  While this now avoids yielding, it has a potential drawback in that the
  scheduled callback will never run if the script is disabled or destroyed
  before the callback runs.

  This is where `Class.Debris` has a specific advantage, as it does not yield
  the current thread and runs outside the context of the script, guaranteeing
  the instance is eventually destroyed even if the script is disabled or
  destroyed. The following code does not yield and guarantees the instance will
  be destroyed:

  ```lua
  Debris:AddItem(brick, 3)
  ```

  Note that `Class.Debris` has a hardcoded maximum of 1,000 objects, so if more
  than 1,000 items are added, the oldest debris will be destroyed instantly to
  make room for new debris.

      The maximum number of items that can be assigned to the `Class.Debris`

      The maximum number of items that can be assigned to the Debris service at
      one time.

      If this number is exceeded, objects are automatically destroyed in order
      from oldest to newest until the amount is less than or equal to MaxItems.

      This property is currently restricted and will error if set. The value is
      hardcoded to 1,000 items.

      Schedules a given `Class.Instance` for destruction within the specified

    description: |
      Schedules a given `Class.Instance` for destruction within the specified
      lifetime. After the `lifetime` argument has elapsed, the object is
      destroyed in the same manner as `Class.Instance:Destroy()`. Note that the
      `lifetime` argument is optional and defaults to 10 seconds.

      Note that `Class.Debris` has a hardcoded maximum of 1,000 objects, so if
      more than 1,000 items are added, the oldest debris will be destroyed
      instantly to make room for new debris. This means you should treat the
      `lifetime` parameter as a **maximum** lifetime, not an exact lifetime.
