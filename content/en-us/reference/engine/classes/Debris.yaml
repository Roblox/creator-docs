  The Debris service allows the developer to schedule guaranteed destruction of
  the object without yielding, through the usage of the `Class.Debris:AddItem()`
  method.

  As Debris is a service it must be created using the
  `Class.ServiceProvider:GetService()` method.

  #### Advantages

  Besides creating a bit of a mess, objects that are no longer required can use
  up system memory and cause an experience to run slower over time. For this
  reason, it's always advised to call `Class.Instance:Destroy()` on objects
  you no longer need. In some cases, however, an object may have a specific
  period of utility before it can be destroyed.

  Consider a wall being smashed into individual bricks. If you want a
  brick to linger for 3 seconds before being destroyed, you can use the
  following code:

  ```lua
  task.wait(3)
  brick:Destroy()
  ```

  However, waiting causes the thread to yield which may not be desired. To avoid
  yielding, a callback function can be scheduled to run on a new thread after 3
  seconds:

  ```lua
  task.delay(3, function()
  	brick:Destroy()
  end)
  ```

  While this solves the above issue by preventing the code from yielding, it
  introduces a second drawback in that the scheduled callback will never run if
  the script is disabled or destroyed before the callback runs.

  This is where `Class.Debris` has a specific advantage, as it does not yield
  the current thread and runs outside the context of the script, guaranteeing
  the instance is eventually destroyed even if the script is disabled or
  destroyed. The following code addresses both issues cited for
  `Library.task.wait()` and `Library.task.delay()`:

  ```lua
  Debris:AddItem(brick, 3)
  ```

  Note that `Class.Debris` has a hardcoded maximum of 1,000 objects, so if
  more than 1,000 items are added, the oldest debris will be destroyed
  instantly to make room for new debris.

      The maximum number of items that can be assigned to the Debris service at

      If this number is exceeded, objects are automatically destroyed in order
      from oldest to newest until the amount is less than or equal to MaxItems.

      This property is currently restricted and will error if set. The value is
      hardcoded to 1,000 items.

      Registers a given `Class.Instance` for removal within the specified

    description: |
      Registers a given `Class.Instance` for removal within the specified
      lifetime. After the `lifetime` argument has elapsed, the object is
      destroyed in the same manner as `Class.Instance:Destroy()`. Note
      that the `lifetime` argument is optional and defaults to 10 seconds.

      Note that `Class.Debris` has a hardcoded maximum of 1,000 objects,
      so if more than 1,000 items are added, the oldest debris will be
      destroyed instantly to make room for new debris. This means you
      should treat the `lifetime` parameter as a **maximum** lifetime,
      not an exact lifetime.
