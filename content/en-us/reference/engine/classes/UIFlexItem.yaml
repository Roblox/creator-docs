summary: |
  Defines flex behavior for a `Class.GuiObject` within a `Class.UIListLayout`.
description: |
  The `Class.UIFlexItem` object defines flex behavior for its parent
  `Class.GuiObject` under the control of a `Class.UIListLayout`. The defined
  flex behavior overrides that of the controlling `Class.UIListLayout`, letting
  you configure flex behavior on a per‑object basis where necessary.

    summary: |
      How the parent `Class.GuiObject` grows or shrinks with available space in
      the flex layout container.
    description: |
      `Enum.UIFlexMode` value which defines how the parent `Class.GuiObject`
      grows or shrinks with available space in the
      [flex layout](../../../ui/list-flex-layouts.md#flex-layouts) container.

      When the container's size is **larger** than the flex line's combined
      basis size, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow` sets an effective `1:0`
      grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`. Objects set to
      `Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow` never shrink below their basis size, so overflow
      may occur if the container becomes smaller than the line's combined basis
      size.

      When the container's size is **smaller** than the flex line's combined
      basis size and the controlling `Class.UIListLayout` is **not** set to wrap
      (resulting in overflow), a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink` sets an
      effective `0:1` grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`. Objects
      set to `Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink` never grow above their basis size, so
      underflow may occur if the container becomes larger than the line's
      combined basis size.

      <img src="../../../assets/engine-api/classes/UIListLayout/FlexMode-Shrink.png" width="800" alt="Diagram showing two items in a line with FlexMode set to Shrink." />

      When the container's size is either larger or smaller than the flex line's
      combined basis size, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Fill` sets an effective
      `1:1` grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`. This setting
      ensures the flex line always fills the container, even if the container
      size changes.

      For fine-tuned layouts, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Custom` enables the
      `Class.UIFlexItem.GrowRatio|GrowRatio` and
      `Class.UIFlexItem.ShrinkRatio|ShrinkRatio` properties, allowing for
      relative growth or shrinking of the object in a ratio compared to other
      flex objects also under control of a `Class.UIFlexItem`.
