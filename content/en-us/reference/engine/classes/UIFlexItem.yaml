  Defines flex behavior for a `Class.GuiObject` within a `Class.UIListLayout`.
description: |
  The **UIFlexItem** defines flex behavior for its parent `Class.GuiObject`
  under the control of a `Class.UIListLayout`. The defined flex behavior
  overrides that of the controlling `Class.UIListLayout`, letting you configure
  flex behavior on a per‑object basis where necessary.

    summary: |
      How the parent `Class.GuiObject` grows or shrinks with available space in
      the flex layout's container.
    description: |
      `Enum.UIFlexMode` value which defines how the parent `Class.GuiObject`
      grows or shrinks with available space in the flex layout's container.

      When the container's size is **larger** than the flex line's combined
      basis size, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow` sets an effective **1:0**
      grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`. Objects set to
      `Enum.UIFlexMode.Grow` never shrink below their basis size, so overflow
      may occur if the container becomes smaller than the line's combined basis
      size.

      When the container's size is **smaller** than the flex line's combined
      basis size and the controlling `Class.UIListLayout` is **not** set to wrap
      (resulting in overflow), a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink` sets an
      effective **0:1** grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`.
      Objects set to `Enum.UIFlexMode.Shrink` never grow above their basis size,
      so underflow may occur if the container becomes larger than the line's
      combined basis size.

      When the container's size is either larger or smaller than the flex line's
      combined basis size, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Fill` sets an effective
      **1:1** grow‑shrink ratio on the parent `Class.GuiObject`. This setting
      ensures the flex line always fills the container, even if the container
      size changes.

      For fine-tuned layouts, a value of `Enum.UIFlexMode.Custom` enables the
      `Class.UIFlexItem.GrowRatio|GrowRatio` and
      `Class.UIFlexItem.ShrinkRatio|ShrinkRatio` properties, allowing for
      relative growth or shrinking of the object in a ratio compared to other
      flex objects also under control of a `Class.UIFlexItem`.
