      This function triggers a custom event with a custom event name data.

      #### Limits of events

      Each game server is allowed a certain number of standard events API calls
      based on the number of players present (more players means more events
      will be needed). The events that exceed the limit will be dropped and log
      an error to the developer console. - Per minute limit: 120 + numPlayers \*
      20, all events shared this limit. - Cooldown: refresh every 10 seconds

      #### Limits of parameters

      Limit the size of parameters. The event that exceeds the limit will be
      dropped and log an error to the developer console.

      **FireEvent** reports a custom event to PlayFab. The event is reported
      using a **category** and **value**, where the category is a string and the
      value can be a string or table. In order to use PlayFab, you must have a
      valid `Class.AnalyticsService.ApiKey|ApiKey` set.

      #### Possible Errors

      - **"AnalyticsService can only be executed by game server."** – Tracking
        can only be done on the server through a `Class.Script` or
        `Class.ModuleScript` required by a script. See
        `Class.RunService:IsServer()`.
      - **"The ApiKey is invalid."** – The
        `Class.AnalyticsService.ApiKey|ApiKey` has been set, but it's invalid.
        Check that it is set to the correct value.
      - **"AnalyticsService can only accept valid UTF-8 characters."** – Thrown
        when the value can't be serialized as UTF-8 characters. This can happen
        if you pass a value which has unicode characters, like emojis.
      - **"AnalyticsService failed in parse event value. Error: ..."** – Thrown
        when there is an issue when serializing the provided value into a
        string.
      - **"AnalyticsService: , " and \r\n are not allowed in category."** – The
        comma `,`, the double quote `"`, and newline characters `\r\n` cannot be
        used in the **category** parameter.
      - **"AnalyticsService: The event value you fired is too long."** – Thrown
        if the **value** parameter was too long after serialization. The length
        limit is 1 KiB, or 1024 bytes.
