  Instance is the base class for all classes in the Roblox class hierarchy.
  Every other class that the Roblox engine defines inherits all of the members
  of Instance. It is not possible to directly create Instance objects.

  Instance has a special function called `Datatype.Instance.new()` which is used
  to create objects via code. This function takes the name of the class as a
  parameter and returns the created object. Abstract classes and services cannot
  be created with the Instance.new function.

      experience is published or saved, or when `Class.Instance:Clone()|Clone()`
      is called on one of the instance's ancestors. Calling
      `Class.Instance:Clone()|Clone()` directly on an instance will return `nil`

      Copying an object in Studio using the **Duplicate** or **Copy**/**Paste**
      options will ignore its own `Class.Instance.Archivable|Archivable` property
      and set `Class.Instance.Archivable|Archivable` to `true` for the copy.

      A read-only string representing the class this `Class.Instance` belongs

      This property can be used with various other functions of Instance that
      are used to identify objects by type, such as `Class.Instance:IsA()` or
      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChildOfClass()`.

      Note this property is read only and cannot be altered by scripts.
      Developers wishing to change an instance's class will instead have to
      create a new `Class.Instance`.

      Unlike `Class.Instance:IsA()`, ClassName can be used to check if an object
      belongs to a specific class ignoring class inheritance. For example:

      ```
      for _, child in workspace:GetChildren() do
          if child.ClassName == "Part" then
              print("Found a Part")
              -- will find Parts in model, but NOT TrussParts, WedgeParts, etc
          end

      A non-unique identifier of the `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      A non-unique identifier of the `Class.Instance`.

      This property is an identifier that describes an object. Names are not
      necessarily unique identifiers however; multiple children of an object may
      share the same name. Names are used to keep the object hierarchy
      organized, along with allowing scripts to access specific objects. The
      name of an instance cannot exceed 100 characters in size.

      The name of an object is often used to access the object through the data
      model hierarchy using the following methods:

      ```
      local baseplate = workspace.Baseplate
      local baseplate = workspace["Baseplate"]
      local baseplate = workspace:FindFirstChild("BasePlate")
      ```

      In order to make an object accessible using the dot operator, an object's
      Name must follow a certain syntax. The objects name must start with an
      underscore or letter. The rest of the name can only contain letters,
      numbers, or underscores (no other special characters). If an objects name
      does not follow this syntax it will not be accessible using the dot
      operator and Lua will not interpret its name as an identifier.

      If more than one object with the same name are siblings then any attempt
      to index an object by that name will return the only one of the objects
      found similar to `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()`, but not always the
      desired object. If a specific object needs to be accessed through code, it
      is recommended to give it a unique name, or guarantee that none of its
      siblings share the same name as it.

      Note, a full name showing the instance's hierarchy can be obtained using
      `Class.Instance:GetFullName()`.

    summary: |
      Determines the hierarchical parent of the `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the
      `Class.Instance`. The following terminology is commonly used when talking
      about how this property is set:

      - An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its
        Parent is set to that object.
      - The **descendants** of an `Class.Instance` are the children of that
        object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
      - The **ancestors** of an `Class.Instance` are all the objects that the
        Instance is a descendant of.

      It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such
      as `Class.Instance:GetChildren()|GetChildren` and
      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild`.

      The `Class.Instance:Remove()|Remove` function sets this property to nil.
      Calling `Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy` will set the Parent of an
      `Class.Instance` and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock**
      the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a
      destroyed object.

      This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game
      or needs removed. As long as an objects parent is in the
      `Class.DataModel`, is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another
      objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the
      object will automatically be removed. The top level `Class.DataModel`
      object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but
      always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the
      duration of a session.

      Newly created objects using `Datatype.Instance.new()` will not have a
      parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The
      most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object,
      then setting its parent.

      ```
      -- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Parent = workspace
      -- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
      Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
      ```

      #### Object Replication

      An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is
      parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then
      setting many properties, it's recommended to **set Parent last**. This
      ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property
      changes.

      ```lua
      local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
      part.Anchored = true
      part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
      -- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
      -- Always set parent last!
      part.Parent = workspace
      ```

      However, if you were parenting your parts to a `Class.Model` whose parent
      hasn't been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the
      model would not have replicated yet.

      Note that when tagging an instance, it's common that some resources are

      tables. To prevent memory leaks, it's a good idea to clean these up
      (disconnect, set to `nil`, etc.) when no longer needed for a tag. Do this
      when calling `Class.Instance:RemoveTag()`, calling

      #### Alternatives to ClearAllChildren

      If the developer does not wish to destroy all descendants, they should use
      `Class.Instance:GetChildren()` or `Class.Instance:GetDescendants()` to
      loop through an object and select what to destroy. For example, the
      following code sample will destroy all parts in an object.

      ```
      for _, instance in object:GetDescendants() do
      	if instance:IsA("BasePart") then

      **Clone** creates a copy of an instance and all of its descendants, ignoring
      all instances that are not `Class.Instance.Archivable|Archivable`. The copy
      of the root instance is returned by this method and its
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` is set to `nil`. Note that if the instance
      itself has `Class.Instance.Archivable|Archivable` set to `false`, this
      function will return `nil`.

      If a reference property such as `Class.ObjectValue.Value` is set in a
      cloned instance, the value of the copy's property depends on original's
      value:

      - If a reference property refers to an instance that was **also** cloned,
      the copy will refer to the copy.
      - If a reference property refers to an object that was **not** cloned,
      the same value is maintained in the copy.

      Sets the `Class.Instance.Parent` property to nil, locks the
      `Class.Instance.Parent` property, disconnects all connections, and calls
      Destroy on all children. This function is the correct way to dispose of
      objects that are no longer required. Disposing of unneeded objects is
      important, since unnecessary objects and connections in a place use up
      memory (this is called a **memory leak**) which can lead to serious
      performance issues over time.

      **Tip:** After calling Destroy on an object, set any variables referencing
      the object (or its descendants) to nil. This prevents your code from
      accessing anything to do with the object.

      ```lua
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Name = "Hello, world"
      part:Destroy()
      -- Don't do this:
      print(part.Name) --> "Hello, world"
      -- Do this to prevent the above line from working:
      part = nil
      ```

      Once an `Class.Instance` has been destroyed by this method it cannot be
      reused because the `Class.Instance.Parent` property is locked. To
      temporarily remove an object, set `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` it to nil
      instead. For example:

      ```
      object.Parent = nil
      wait(2)
      object.Parent = workspace
      ```

      To Destroy an object after a set amount of time, use
      `Class.Debris:AddItem()`.

      immediate children of the `Class.Instance`.

      #### Checking the Existence of an Object

      FindFirstChild is necessary if you need to verify an object exists before
      continuing. Attempting to index a child by name using the dot operator
      throws an error if the child doesn't exist.

      ```lua
      -- The following line errors if Part doesn't exist in the Workspace:
      workspace.Part.Transparency = 0.5
      ```

      Use FindFirstChild to first check for Part, then use an if-statement to
      run code that needs it.

      ```lua
      local part = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
      if part then
      	part.Transparency = 0.5
      end
      ```

      #### Finding a Child Whose Name Matches a Property

      Sometimes the `Class.Instance.Name|Name` of an object is the same as that
      of a property of its `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent`. When using the dot
      operator, properties take precedence over children if they share a name.

      In the following example, a `Class.Folder` called "Color" is added to a
      `Class.Part`, which also has the `Class.Part.Color` property.
      `Class.Part.Color` refers to the `Datatype.Color3`, not the Folder.

      ```lua
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      local folder = Instance.new("Folder")
      folder.Name = "Color"
      folder.Parent = part
      local c = part.Color --> A Color3
      local c2 = part:FindFirstChild("Color") --> The Folder
      ```

      A benefit of using `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild()` in
      this way is that the introduction of new properties does not impose a risk
      on your code.

      #### Performance Note

      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild()` takes about 20% longer
      than using the dot operator and almost 8 times longer than simply storing
      a reference to an object. Therefore, you should avoid calling it in
      performance-dependent code such as in tight loops or functions connected
      to `Class.RunService.Heartbeat` and `Class.RunService.PreRender`. Instead,
      store the result in a variable, or consider using
      `Class.Instance.ChildAdded|ChildAdded` or
      `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` to detect when a child of a
      given name becomes available.

      If no matching child is found, this function returns nil. If the optional

      than only the immediate children of the `Class.Instance`.

      Unlike `Class.Instance:FindFirstChildOfClass()`, this function uses

    description: |
      The **GetDescendants** function of an object returns an array that
      contains all of the descendants of that object. Unlike
      `Class.Instance:GetChildren()`, which only returns the immediate children
      of an object, GetDescendants will find every child of the object, every
      child of those children, and so on.

      The arrays returned by GetDescendants are arranged so that parents come
      earlier than their children. Refer to the following example of a
      `Class.Model` in the `Class.Workspace`:

      ![Workspace Descendants](/assets/legacy/GetDescendantsExample.png)

      Inside this model are three parts (C, D, and E) and another model
      (InnerModel). Inside the inner model are two more parts (A and B). Calling
      GetDescendants on the first model and printing the contents of the
      returned array would print the first level of children (InnerModel, C, D,
      and E) before A and B.

      ```lua

      -- Loop through all of the descendants of the model and
      -- print out their name

      This method returns an event that behaves exactly like the

      method instead of a connection to `Class.Instance.Changed|Changed` with a

      the same object with the same property name return the same event.

      `Class.ValueBase` objects, such as `Class.IntValue` and

      that fires with the contents of their value property. As such, this method
      provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those objects.

      Note that this event will not pass any arguments to a connected function,
      so the value of the changed property must be read directly within a
      script.

      Like `Class.Instance.Changed|Changed`, the event returned by this method
      does not fire for physics-related changes, such as when the

      IsA returns true if the instance's class is **equivalent to** or a

      **instanceof** operators in other languages, and is a form of
      [type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection). To
      ignore class inheritance, test the `Class.Instance.ClassName|ClassName`
      property directly instead. For checking native Lua data types (number,
      string, etc) use the functions `type` and `typeof`.

      Most commonly, this function is used to test if an object is some kind of
      part, such as `Class.Part` or `Class.WedgePart`, which inherits from
      `Class.BasePart` (an abstract class). For example, if your goal is to
      change all of a character's limbs to the same color, you might use
      `Class.Instance:GetChildren()|GetChildren` to iterate over the children,
      then use IsA to filter non-`Class.BasePart` objects which lack the
      `Datatype.BrickColor` property:

      ```lua
      local function paintFigure(character, color)
      	-- Iterate over the child objects of the character
      	for _, child in character:GetChildren() do
      		-- Filter out non-part objects, such as Shirt, Pants and Humanoid
      		-- R15 use MeshPart and R6 use Part, so we use BasePart here to detect both:
      		if child:IsA("BasePart") then
      			child.BrickColor = color
      		end
      	end
      end
      paintFigure(game.Players.Player.Character, BrickColor.new("Bright blue"))
      ```

      Since all classes inherit from `Class.Instance`, calling
      `object:IsA("Instance")` will always return true.

      ```lua

      #### Limitations

      Naming requirements and restrictions:

      - Names must only use alphanumeric characters and underscore
      - No spaces or unique symbols are allowed
      - Strings must be 100 characters or less
      - Names are not allowed to start with RBX unless the caller is a Roblox
        core-script (reserved for Roblox)

      When attempting to set an attribute to an unsupported type, an error will
      be thrown.

      the `timeOut` parameter is specified, this method will time out after the
      specified number of seconds and return `nil`.

      #### Primary Usage

      `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` is extremely important when
      working on code run by the client in a `Class.LocalScript`. The Roblox
      engine does not guarantee the time or order in which objects are
      replicated from the server to the client. Additionally, if an experience
      has `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled` set to true,
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are far away from the player's character
      may not be streamed to the client, potentially causing scripts to break
      when indexing objects that do not yet exist on the client.

      #### Notes

      - This function does not yield if a child with the given name exists when
        the call is made.
      - `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()` is a more efficient alternative to
        `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` for objects that are
        assumed to exist.
      - If a call to this method exceeds 5 seconds without returning, and no
        `timeOut` parameter has been specified, a warning will be printed to the
        output that the thread may yield indefinitely.

      You can use this event to track the deletion of an instance in Studio,

    summary: |
      Fired immediately after a property of an object changes.
    description: |
      The Changed event fires right after most properties change on objects. It
      is possible to find the present value of a changed property by using
      `object[property]`. To get the value of a property before it changes, you
      must have stored the value of the property before it changed.

      If you are only interested in listening to the change of a specific
      property, consider using the `GetPropertyChangedSignal` method instead to
      get an event that only fires when a given property changes.

      For "value" objects such as `Class.IntValue`, this event only fires when
      the `Value` property changes. See individual pages for `Class.IntValue`,
      `Class.StringValue`, etc. for more information. To detect other changes in
      these objects, you must use `Class.Instance:GetPropertyChangedSignal()
      instead.

      This event does not fire for physics-related changes, like when the
      `Datatype.CFrame`, `Velocity`, `RotVelocity`, `Position`, `Orientation`
      and `Datatype.CFrame` properties of a `Class.BasePart` change due to
      gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider using a
      physics-based event like `Class.RunService.PreSimulation` or
      `Class.BasePart.Touched`.

      Fires after an object is parented to this `Class.Instance`.

      Note, when using this function on a client to detect objects created by
      the server it is necessary to use `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()` when
      indexing these object's descendants. This is because the object and its
      descendants are not guaranteed to replicate from the server to the client
      simultaneously. For example:

      ```
      workspace.ChildAdded:Connect(function(child)
      	-- need to use WaitForChild as descendants may not have replicated yet
      	local head = child:WaitForChild("Head")
      end)
      ```

      Note, this function only works for immediate children of the
      `Class.Instance`. For a function that captures all descendants, use

      Removed refers to when an object's parent is changed from this

      event will also fire when a child is destroyed (using
      `Class.Instance:Destroy()`) as the destroy function sets an object's
      parent to nil.

      This function only works for immediate children of the `Class.Instance`.

      Fires immediately before a descendant of the `Class.Instance` is removed.
    description: |
      DescendantRemoving fires **immediately before** the
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` of a descendant of the `Class.Instance`
      changes such that the object is no longer a descendant of the Instance.
      `Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy` and `Class.Instance:Remove()|Remove`
      change an object's Parent to nil, so calling these on a descendant of an
      object will therefore cause this event to fire.

      Since this event fires before the descendant's removal, the Parent of the
      descendant will be unchanged, i.e., it will still be a descendant at the
      time of this event firing. If the descendant is also a child of the
      object, It will also fire before ChildRemoved. There is no similar event
      called "DescendantRemoved".

      If a descendant has children, this event fires with the descendant first
      followed by its descendants.

      #### Example

      The example below should help clarify how DescendantRemoving fires when
      there are several objects involved.

      ![A cropped screenshot of the Explorer window. A Model contains ModelA and ModelB, which each contain a Part, PartA and PartB respectively. PartA contains a Fire object named FireA.](/assets/legacy/DescendantRemoving2.png)

      - Calling `Class.Instance:Remove()|Remove` on **PartA** would cause
        DescendantRemoving to fire on both **ModelA** and **Model**, in that
        order.
      - Setting the `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` of **PartA** to **ModelB**
        would cause DescendantRemoving to fire on **ModelA** but not **Model**
        (as Model would still be an ancestor of PartA).
      - Calling `Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy` on **ModelA** would cause
        DescendantRemoving to fire multiple times on several objects:
        1. On **Model** with **ModelA**, **PartA** then **FireA**.
        2. On **ModelA**, with **PartA** then **FireA**.
        3. On **PartA** with **FireA**.

      #### Warning

      This event fires with the descendant object that is being removed.
      Attempting to set the `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` of the descendant
      being removed to something else **will fail** with the following warning:
      "Something unexpectedly tried to set the parent of X to Y while trying to
      set the parent of X. Current parent is Z", where X is the removing
      descendant, Y is the ignored parent setting, and Z is the original parent
      of X. Below is an example that demonstrates this:

      ```
      workspace.DescendantRemoving:Connect(function(descendant)
      	-- Don't manipulate the parent of descendant in this function!
      	-- This event fires BECAUSE the parent of descendant was manipulated,
      	-- and the change hasn't happened yet, i.e. this function fires before that happens.
      	-- Therefore, it is problematic to change the parent like this:
      	descendant.Parent = game
      end)
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Parent = workspace
      part.Parent = nil -- This triggers DescendantRemoving on Workspace:
      --> Something unexpectedly tried to set the parent of Part to NULL while trying to set the parent of Part. Current parent is Workspace.
