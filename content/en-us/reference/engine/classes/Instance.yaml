  `Instance` is the base class for all classes in the Roblox class hierarchy
  which can be part of the `Class.DataModel` tree.

  It is not possible to directly create root `Instance` objects, but the special
  `Datatype.Instance.new()` constructor creates objects via code, taking the
  name of the class as a parameter and returning the created object.

    summary: |
      A non-unique identifier of the `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      A non-unique identifier of the `Class.Instance`. Names are used to keep
      the object hierarchy organized, along with allowing scripts to access
      specific objects. The name of an instance cannot exceed 100 characters in
      size.

      The name of an object is often used to access the object through the data
      model hierarchy using the following methods:

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local baseplate = Workspace.Baseplate
      local baseplate = Workspace["Baseplate"]
      local baseplate = Workspace:FindFirstChild("BasePlate")
      ```

      In order to make an object accessible using the dot operator (`.`), its
      name must start with an underscore or letter, and the rest of the name can
      only contain letters, numbers, or underscores (no other special
      characters). If an object's name does not follow this syntax, it will not
      be accessible using the dot operator and Luau will not interpret its name
      as an identifier.

      If more than one object with the same name are siblings, any attempt to
      index an object by that name will return only one of the objects, similar
      to `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()`, but not always the desired object.
      If a specific object needs to be accessed through code, it's recommended
      to give it a unique name or guarantee that none of its siblings share the
      same name.

      See also `Class.Instance:GetFullName()` to obtain a full name including
      the object's hierarchy.

  - name: Instance.Parent
    summary: |
      Determines the hierarchical parent of the `Class.Instance`.
    description: |
      The `Parent` property determines the hierarchical parent of the
      `Class.Instance`. The following terminology is commonly used when talking
      about how this property is set:

      - An object is a **child** of, or is **parented to**, another object when
        its `Parent` is set to that object.

      - The **descendants** of an `Class.Instance` are the children of that
        object, plus the descendants of the children as well.

      - The **ancestors** of an `Class.Instance` are all the objects that the
        instance is a descendant of.

      It is from the `Parent` property that many other API members get their
      name, such as `Class.Instance:GetChildren()|GetChildren()` and
      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild()`. This property is also
      used to manage whether an object exists in the experience or needs to be
      removed. As long as an object's parent is in the `Class.DataModel`, is
      stored in a variable, or is referenced by another object's property, the
      object remains in the experience; otherwise, the object will automatically
      be removed.

      Calling `Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy()` will set the `Parent` of an
      `Class.Instance` and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock**
      the `Parent` property. An error is raised when setting the `Parent` of a
      destroyed object.

      Newly created objects using `Datatype.Instance.new()` will not have a
      parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set.

      ##### Object Replication

      An object created by the server will not replicate to clients until it is
      parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object and
      setting many properties, it's recommended to set the `Parent` property
      **last**. This ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating
      many property changes.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Set new instance's parent last (recommended)
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      part.Parent = Workspace
      ```

      However, if parenting parts to a `Class.Model` whose parent hasn't been
      set yet, parenting each part to that model is acceptable since the model
      would not have replicated.

    summary: |
      Applies a tag to the instance.
    description: |
      This method applies a tag to the instance, with no effect if the tag is
      already applied. Successfully adding a tag will fire a signal created by
      `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceAddedSignal()` with the given tag.

      ##### Warnings

      - An instance's tags that were added client-side will be dropped if the
        server later adds or removes a tag on that instance because the server
        replicates all tags together and overwrites previous tags.

      - When tagging an instance, it is common that some resources are used to
        give the tag its functionality, for example event connections or tables.
        To prevent memory leaks, it's a good idea to clean these up (disconnect,
        set to `nil`, etc.) when no longer needed for a tag. Do this when
        calling `Class.Instance:RemoveTag()`, calling
        `Class.Instance:Destroy()`, or in a function connected to a signal
        returned by `Class.CollectionService:GetInstanceRemovedSignal()`.

      `Clone()` creates a copy of an instance and all of its descendants,

      return `nil`.

      If a reference property such as `Class.ObjectValue.Value` is set in a
      cloned instance, the value of the copy's property depends on the
      original's value:

      - If a reference property refers to an instance that was **also** cloned,
        the copy will refer to the copy.
      - If a reference property refers to an instance that was **not** cloned,
        the same value is maintained in the copy.

      Sets the `Class.Instance.Parent` property to `nil`, locks the

    description: |
      Sets the `Class.Instance.Parent` property to `nil`, locks the
      `Class.Instance.Parent` property, disconnects all connections, and calls
      `Destroy()` on all children. This method is the correct way to dispose of
      objects that are no longer required.

      Disposing of unneeded objects is important, since unnecessary objects and
      connections in a place use up memory which can lead to serious performance
      issues over time.

      As a best practice after calling `Destroy()` on an object, set any
      variables referencing the object (or its descendants) to `nil`. This
      prevents your code from accessing anything to do with the object.

      ```lua
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Name = "Hello, world"
      part:Destroy()

      -- Do this to prevent the above line from working:
      part = nil
      ```

      Once an `Class.Instance` has been destroyed by this method, it cannot be
      reused because the `Class.Instance.Parent` property is locked. To
      **temporarily** remove an object instead of destroying it, set
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` to `nil`. For example:

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      object.Parent = nil
      task.wait(2)
      object.Parent = Workspace
      ```

      To destroy an object after a set amount of time, use
      `Class.Debris:AddItem()`.

      This method is a variant of `Class.Instance:FindFirstAncestor()` which

      `Class.Instance.Name`. `Class.Instance:FindFirstAncestorWhichIsA()` also
      exists, using the `Class.Object:IsA()` method instead to respect class
      inheritance.

      Returns the first ancestor of the `Class.Instance` for whom

      This method works upwards, meaning it starts at the instance's immediate
      `Class.Instance.Parent` and works up towards the `Class.DataModel`. If no
      matching ancestor is found, it returns `nil`.

      Unlike `Class.Instance:FindFirstAncestorOfClass()`, this method uses

      print(part:IsA("BasePart"))  --> true
      print(part:IsA("Instance"))  --> true
      ```

      Therefore, the following code sample will return the first
      `Class.BasePart` ancestor, regardless of if it is a `Class.WedgePart`,
      `Class.MeshPart` or `Class.Part`.

      ```
      local part = object:FindFirstAncestorWhichIsA("BasePart")

      `true`, this method searches all descendants rather than only the
      immediate children of the `Class.Instance`.

      ##### Checking the Existence of an Object

      `FindFirstChild()` is necessary if you need to verify an object exists
      before continuing. Attempting to index a child by name using the dot
      operator throws an error if the child doesn't exist.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- The following line errors if the part doesn't exist in the workspace
      Workspace.Part.Transparency = 0.5
      ```

      A better approach is to use `FindFirstChild()` to first check for `Part`,
      then use an `if` statement to run code that needs it.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local part = Workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
      if part then
      	part.Transparency = 0.5
      end
      ```

      ##### Finding a Child Whose Name Matches a Property

      Sometimes the `Class.Instance.Name|Name` of an object is the same as that
      of a property of its `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent`. When using the dot
      operator, properties take precedence over children if they share a name.

      In the following example, a `Class.Folder` called `Color` is added to a
      `Class.Part`, which also has the `Class.Part.Color` property. Notice that
      `part.Color` refers to the `Datatype.Color3` property value, not the child
      `Class.Folder` instance. A benefit of using
      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild()` is that the
      introduction of new properties does not impose a risk on your code.

      ```lua
      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      local folder = Instance.new("Folder")
      folder.Name = "Color"
      folder.Parent = part
      local c1 = part.Color  -- The property
      local c2 = part:FindFirstChild("Color")  -- The child folder
      ```

      ##### Performance Notes

      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()|FindFirstChild()` takes about 20% longer
      than using the dot operator and almost 8 times longer than simply storing
      a reference to an object. Therefore, you should avoid calling it in
      performance-dependent code such as in tight loops or functions connected
      to `Class.RunService.Heartbeat` and `Class.RunService.PreRender`. Instead,
      store the result in a variable, or consider using
      `Class.Instance.ChildAdded|ChildAdded` or
      `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` to detect when a child of a
      given name becomes available.

      `Class.Object.Changed|Changed` with a function that checks the attribute
      name. Subsequent calls to this method on the same object with the same
      attribute name return the same event.

      The following code example returns a signal that fires the function
      `attributeChanged()` when the part's `InitialPosition` attribute changes:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      part:SetAttribute("InitialPosition", part.Position)

      local function attributeChanged()

      descendants by a combination of selectors and combinators.

      Returns a string describing the instance's ancestry. The string is a
      concatenation of the `Class.Instance.Name|Name` of the object and its
      ancestors, separated by periods. The `Class.DataModel` (`game`) is not
      considered. For example, a `Class.Part` in the `Class.Workspace` may
      return `Class.Workspace.Part`.

      When called on an `Class.Instance` that is not a descendant of the
      `Class.DataModel`, this method considers all ancestors up to and including
      the topmost one without a `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent`.

      This method is useful for logging and debugging. You shouldn't attempt to
      parse the returned string for any useful operation; this method does not
      escape periods (or any other symbol) in object names. In other words,

      This method indicates whether a specific property has been modified from

      [Explorer](../../../studio/explorer.md) window insertion, the result may
      differ.

      For example, querying the
      `Class.TextLabel.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3` property of a
      `Class.TextLabel` inserted via the [Explorer](../../../studio/explorer.md)
      will return `true`, but querying the same property of a `Class.TextLabel`

      styling it. To reset a property to its code‑instantiated default and allow

    summary: ''
    description: |
      This object method returns an array which contains the descendants of that
      object matching the provided `selector` string. The `selector` string can
      include multiple selectors and combinators to match characteristics such
      as the class name, instance name, hierarchy relationships, as well as
      specific values of instance properties and attributes. The `selector`
      grammar is similar to the one used in `Class.StyleRule` with only a few
      differences regarding which parts of the grammar are supported or not.

      #### Selectors

      - `ClassName` — Matches instances of the specified class in a
        `Class.Object:IsA()` relationship.
      - `.Tag` — Matches instances tagged with a `Class.CollectionService` tag.
      - `#Name` — Matches instances of a specific `Class.Instance.Name`.
      - `[property = value]` — Matches instances which have the specified
        property and that property has the specified value. Boolean, number, and
        string values are supported. Letters, numbers, `_`, and `-` can be used
        without putting the value in quotation marks.
      - `[$attribute]` — Matches instances which have the specified
        [attribute](../../../studio/properties.md#instance-attributes) set.
      - `[$attribute = value]` — Matches instances which have the specified
        attribute **and** that attribute has the specified value. Same
        limitations apply as for property selectors.

      Selectors can also be combined. For example,
      `Model.Apple[$Variety = Fuji][$Flavor = 4]` will match instances which are
      a `Class.Model` tagged as `Apple` and which have a `Variety` attribute
      equal to `Fuji` as well as a `Flavor` attribute equal to `4`.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Get all MeshPart descendants
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("MeshPart"))

      -- Get all descendants tagged as "Fruit"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(".Fruit"))

      -- Get all descendants with the name "RedTree"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("#RedTree"))

      -- Get all descendants with CanCollide property set to false
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("[CanCollide = false]"))

      -- Get all descendants with a "FuelCapacity" attribute assigned
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("[$FuelCapacity]"))
      -- Get all descendants with a "FuelCapacity" attribute set to 75
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("[$FuelCapacity = 75]"))
      ```

      #### Combinators

      Combinators let you mix basic selectors to match deeper hierarchy
      relationships.

      - `>` — Matches instances that are **direct children** of the previous
        filter matches.

      - `>>` — Matches instances that are **descendants** of the previous filter
        matches. This is the default first filter, meaning that `SpotLight.Red`
        is the same as `>> SpotLight.Red`.

      - `,` — Specifies a list of multiple independent selectors for the
        descendant query. Only elements matching the filter are placed in the
        returned array; `nil` will not be included for non‑matches in a query
        list.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Get direct children of any Model that are tagged as "SwordPart"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("Model > .SwordPart"))

      -- Get direct children which are a Part and are tagged as "Apple"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("> Part.Apple"))

      -- Get descendants of any Model with an attribute "OnFire" set to true
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("Model >> [$OnFire = true]"))

      -- Get MeshPart descendants tagged as "SwordPart" OR with an attribute "OnFire" set to true
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("MeshPart.SwordPart, MeshPart[$OnFire = true]"))
      ```

      #### Pseudo-class selectors

      - `:not(complex-selector-list)` — Allows selecting instances which do
        **not** match any of the selectors inside, effectively performing a
        negation of the selectors. Since the expression inside is a list of
        complex selectors, it's possible to filter based on multiple conditions.

      - `:has(relative-selector-list)` — Allows selecting instances based on
        which instances they contain inside. The selector list is evaluated
        relative to each instance.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      -- Get all descendants which are NOT of class SpotLight
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(":not(SpotLight)"))
      -- Get all descendants which are NOT of class SpotLight OR PointLight
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(":not(SpotLight, PointLight)"))
      -- Get all descendants which do NOT have an attribute "OnFire"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(":not([$OnFire])"))
      -- Get all descendants EXCEPT children of a Model tagged as "SwordPart"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(":not(Model > .SwordPart)"))

      -- Get descendants which contain a Tool instance as their own descendant
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants(":has(Tool)"))
      -- Get MeshPart descendants which contain a direct child tagged as "SwordPart"
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("MeshPart:has(> .SwordPart)"))

      -- Get MeshPart descendants with direct children NOT of SurfaceAppearance or Texture class
      print(Workspace:QueryDescendants("MeshPart:has(> :not(SurfaceAppearance, Texture))"))

      ##### Limitations

      Naming requirements and restrictions:

      - Names must only use alphanumeric characters.
        - You may also include periods, hyphens, slashes, and underscores.
      - No spaces or unique symbols (such as @, ~, !) are allowed.
      - Strings must be 100 characters or less.
      - Names are not allowed to start with **RBX** unless the caller is a
        Roblox core script (reserved for Roblox).

      When attempting to set an attribute to an unsupported type, an error will
      be thrown.

      child does not exist, it will yield the current thread until it does. If
      the `timeOut` parameter is specified, this method will time out after the
      specified number of seconds and return `nil`.

      ##### Primary Usage

      `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` is extremely important when
      working on code run by the client in a `Class.LocalScript`. The Roblox
      engine does not guarantee the time or order in which objects are
      replicated from the server to the client. Additionally, if an experience
      has `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled` set to true,
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are far away from the player's character
      may not be streamed to the client, potentially causing scripts to break
      when indexing objects that do not yet exist on the client.

      ##### Notes

      - This method does not yield if a child with the given name exists when
        the call is made.
      - `Class.Instance:FindFirstChild()` is a more efficient alternative to
        `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` for objects that are
        assumed to exist.
      - If a call to this method exceeds 5 seconds without returning, and no
        `timeOut` parameter has been specified, a warning will be printed to the
        output that the thread may yield indefinitely.

      Fires when the `Class.Instance.Parent` property of the object or one of
      its ancestors is changed.

      This event includes two parameters: `child` refers to the `Class.Instance`
      whose `Class.Instance.Parent` was actually changed, while `parent` refers
      to this instance's new `Class.Instance.Parent`.

      You can use this event to track the deletion of an instance in Studio,
      such as manual deletion in the Explorer or through a plugin. If you need
      to detect when an instance is destroyed using `Class.Instance:Destroy()`,
      use the `Class.Instance.Destroying` event instead.

    description: |
      This event fires whenever any attribute is changed on the instance,
      including when an attribute is set to `nil`. The name of the changed
      attribute is passed to the connected function.

      For example, the following code snippet connects the `attributeChanged()`
      function to fire whenever one of the part's attributes changes:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local part = Workspace.Part

      local function attributeChanged(attributeName)
      	print(attributeName, "changed")
      end

      part.AttributeChanged:Connect(attributeChanged)
      ```

      See also `Class.Instance:GetAttributeChangedSignal()` which returns an
      event that fires when a specific given attribute changes.

      Fires after an object is parented to this `Class.Instance`.

      Note, when using this method on a client to detect objects created by the
      server it is necessary to use `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()` when
      indexing these object's descendants. This is because the object and its
      descendants are not guaranteed to replicate from the server to the client
      simultaneously. For example:

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      Workspace.ChildAdded:Connect(function(child)
      	-- Use WaitForChild() since descendants may not have replicated yet
      	local head = child:WaitForChild("Head")
      end)
      ```

      Note, this event only operates for immediate children of the
      `Class.Instance`. For an event that captures all descendants, use
      `Class.Instance.DescendantAdded`.

      Fires after a child is removed from this `Class.Instance`.

      Removed refers to when an object's parent is changed from this
      `Class.Instance` to something other than this `Class.Instance`. Note, this
      event will also fire when a child is destroyed (using
      `Class.Instance:Destroy()`) as the destroy function sets an object's
      parent to `nil`.

      This event only operates for immediate children of the `Class.Instance`.
      For an event that captures all descendants, use
      `Class.Instance.DescendantRemoving`.

      See also `Class.Instance.ChildAdded`.

    description: |
      This event fires after a descendant is added to the `Class.Instance`.

      As it fires for every descendant, parenting an object to the
      `Class.Instance` will fire the event for this object and all of its
      descendants individually.

      If you're only concerned with the **direct children** of the
      `Class.Instance`, use `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` instead.

      See also `Class.Instance.DescendantRemoving`.
    code_samples:
      - Instance-DescendantAdded1
    parameters:
      - name: descendant
        type: Instance

      Fires immediately before a descendant of the `Class.Instance` is removed.
    description: |
      This event fires **immediately before** the parent `Class.Instance`
      changes such that a **descendant** instance will no longer be a
      descendant. `Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy()` changes an instance's
      `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` to `nil`, so calling that method on a
      descendant of the parent will cause this event to fire.

      Since this event fires **before** the descendant's removal, the parent of
      the descendant will be unchanged at the time of this event firing. If the
      descendant is also a **direct child** of the parent, this event will fire
      before `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved`.

      If a descendant has children, this event fires with the descendant first,
      followed by its descendants.

      ##### Warning

      This event fires with the descendant object that is being removed.
      Attempting to set the `Class.Instance.Parent|Parent` of the descendant to
      something else will fail. Below is an example that demonstrates this:

      ```
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      Workspace.DescendantRemoving:Connect(function(descendant)
      	-- Do not manipulate the parent of the descendant in this function!
      	-- This event fires BECAUSE the parent was manipulated, and the change hasn't happened yet
      	-- Therefore, it is problematic to change the parent like this:
      	descendant.Parent = game
      end)

      local part = Instance.new("Part")
      part.Parent = Workspace
      part.Parent = nil
      ```

      See also `Class.Instance.DescendantAdded|DescendantAdded`.

    description: |
      The `Class.Instance` will never be deleted from memory while a connected
      function is still using it. However, if the function yields at any point,
      the `Class.Instance` and its descendants will be parented to `nil`.

      If the `Class.Workspace.SignalBehavior` property is set to
      `Enum.SignalBehavior.Immediate`, this event fires immediately before the
      `Class.Instance` or one of its ancestors is destroyed with
      `Class.Instance:Destroy()`.

      If the `Class.Workspace.SignalBehavior` property is set to
      `Enum.SignalBehavior.Deferred`, this event fires at the next resumption
      point, which will be after the `Class.Instance` or one of its ancestors is
      destroyed with `Class.Instance:Destroy()`.

      With `Enum.SignalBehavior.Deferred|Deferred` behavior, connecting a script
      to its own `Class.Instance.Destroying` event is problematic, as the script
      will be destroyed before the callback can be called (meaning it will not
      execute).

      When deleting an `Class.Instance` in Studio, such as manually deleting
      through the [Explorer](../../../studio/explorer.md) or through a plugin,
      the `Class.Instance` isn't destroyed. Instead, the parent is set to `nil`
      which you can track with `Class.Instance.AncestryChanged`.
