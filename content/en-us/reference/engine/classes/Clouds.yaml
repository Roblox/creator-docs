  Renders realistic clouds that drift slowly across the sky.
description: |
  The **Clouds** object renders realistic clouds that drift slowly across the
  sky. Both cloud cover and density can be adjusted, as well as cloud color to
  achieve atmospheres like stormy skies, moody sunsets, alien worlds, etc.

  See the <a href="../../../environment/clouds.md">Dynamic Clouds</a> article
  for a summary of properties and expected results.

      Controls the material color of cloud particles.
    description: |
      This property controls the material color of cloud particles. However,
      cloud color is influenced by several `Class.Lighting` and
      `Class.Atmosphere` properties, so it is not intended as a dedicated
      property to simulate colored sunsets, sunrises, etc.

      This property defines the cloud cover within the overall skyscape layer.
      Valid range is from 0 to 1 (sparse cloud cover to full cloud cover).

      This property controls the particulate density of clouds (the proportion
      of airborne water vapor particles at full cloud cover).
