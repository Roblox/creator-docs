  Plays text as speech audio.
description: |
  `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` is used to play text as speech audio. It provides a
  single **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via
  `Class.Wire|Wires`. This API is still in development and is not yet publicly
  available.

      Denotes whether the `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` object is loaded, buffered,
      and ready to play. Although uncommon, `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` objects
      may have their assets unloaded at runtime if there is extreme memory
      pressure, in which case `Class.AudioTextToSpeech.IsLoaded|IsLoaded` will
      become false.
