  Plays text as speech audio.
description: |
  `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` is used to play text as speech audio. It provides a
  single **Output** pin which can be connected to other pins via
  `Class.Wire|Wires`.

  Roblox uses the following formula to throttle requests for this API based on
  the number of players in your experience:
  `max requests per minute per experience = 1 + (6 * number_of_concurrent_users)`.
  You can purchase additional usage using
  [Extended Services](../../../cloud-services/extended-services.md).

  For a more in-depth look, see
  [Text-to-speech](../../../audio/objects.md#text-to-speech).

      Denotes whether the `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` object is loaded, buffered,
      and ready to play. Although uncommon, `Class.AudioTextToSpeech` objects
      may have their assets unloaded at runtime if there is extreme memory
      pressure, in which case `Class.AudioTextToSpeech.IsLoaded|IsLoaded` will
      become false.
