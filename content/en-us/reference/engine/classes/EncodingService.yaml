      Method takes a `Library.buffer` with data encoded in Base64 format and
      decodes it into a new `Library.buffer`.

      If the input is not valid Base64 data, this method throws an error.

      Base64 data is most often used for binary data encoding, so these
      functions are designed to work on `Library.buffer` values.

      If the data is stored in a string, `Library.buffer.fromstring` can be used
      to quickly convert it into a buffer.

      Compresses the binary data stored in a `Library.buffer` using the

      For `Enum.CompressionAlgorithm.Zstd`, the allowed compression values are
      from -7 to 22 inclusive.

      #### Do not use this for passwords

      None of these hashes are password hashing algorithms. They were designed
      to be fast to execute, whereas password hashing should never be fast. You
      shouldn't use this function for computing password hashes that will be
      stored, or for deriving keys from passwords.

    description: |
      Decompresses the binary data stored in a `Library.buffer` using the
      specified compression algorithm.

      Decompression might throw an error if the compressed data doesn't contain
      expected decompressed size, if it is larger than 1GB or if it is invalid.

      It is recommended to use `Class.EncodingService.GetDecompressedBufferSize`
      to find out the decompressed data size before attempting to decompress.
      This is very important if the input buffer contents are outside of your
      control (for example, from a client `Class.RemoveEvent`)

      `nil` is returned, attempting to use
      `Class.EncodingService.DecompressBuffer` on this `Library.buffer` will
      throw an error.
