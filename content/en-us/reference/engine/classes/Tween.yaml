description: |
  The `Tween` object controls the playback of an interpolation. Creating and
  configuring a `Tween` is done with the `Class.TweenService:Create()` function;
  `Datatype.Instance.new()` cannot be used for this particular object.

  Note that while the configuration of a tween can be accessed after a tween has
  been created, it can not be modified. If new goals are needed for an
  interpolation, a new `Tween` must be created.

  Also note that multiple tweens can be played on the same object at the same
  time, but they must not be interpolating the same property. If two tweens
  attempt to modify the same property, the initial tween will be cancelled and
  overwritten by the most recent tween.
