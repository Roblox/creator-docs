  An abstract class inherited by 3D handle adornments.
description: |
  `HandleAdornment` is an abstract class inherited by 3D handle adornments. If
  parented to a player's `Class.PlayerGui` or the `Class.CoreGui`, handles can
  listen to input events for purposes such as making dragger tools.

      workspace. As an exception, setting `Class.HandleAdornment.ZIndex|ZIndex`
      to `-1` will override an `Class.HandleAdornment.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop`
      value of `true` and cause the adornment to appear either in front of or
      behind other adornments and objects based on their relative position in
      the 3D space.

    summary: |
      The positional offset of the adornment based on the adornee's
      `Class.BasePart.Size`.
    description: |
      By default, an adornment draws in the center of its
      `Class.HandleAdornment.Adornee|Adornee`, but this property shifts the
      adornment's relative position based on the adornee's
      `Class.BasePart.Size`.

      Note that the units of
      `Class.HandleAdornment.SizeRelativeOffset|SizeRelativeOffset` are a
      **scale** based on the size of the adornee itself, such that a value of
      `1` will move the adornment to the corresponding edge of the adornee. For
      example, a value of `Datatype.Vector3.new(0, 1, 0)` will shift the
      adornment to the exact top of its adornee.

    summary: |
      Determines the draw order of this `Class.HandleAdornment` when
      `Class.HandleAdornment.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` is `true`.
    description: |
      Only applies if `Class.HandleAdornment.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` is `true`
      and determines the draw order of this `Class.HandleAdornment` relative to
      other adornments. It does not relate to the
      `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex|ZIndex` property for `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`.

      Valid values are from `-1` to `10` with higher values drawing on top (in
      front) of lesser values. This drawing order will be respected even if an
      adornment is in front of or behind another adornment in the 3D space.

      As an exception, setting `Class.HandleAdornment.ZIndex|ZIndex` to `-1` or
      `Class.HandleAdornment.AlwaysOnTop|AlwaysOnTop` to `false` will cause the
      adornment to appear either in front of or behind other adornments and
      objects based on their relative position in the 3D space.
