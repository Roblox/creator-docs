  HandleAdornment is an abstract class inherited by 3D handle adornments.

  **Note:** For handles to be interactive, they must be parented to a player's
  `Class.PlayerGui` or the `Class.CoreGui`. **HandleAdornment** is an abstract
  class inherited by 3D handle adornments.

      Even if the adornment is behind a part based on its
      `Class.HandleAdornment.CFrame`, if **AlwaysOnTop** is true then the
      adornment will still draw on top. The one exception to this behavior is if
      the `Class.HandleAdornment.ZIndex` of the adornment is set to -1. If this
      is the case, the adornment will always draw behind 3d geometry.

      The position and rotation relative to its `Class.PVAdornment.Adornee`.
      This CFrame is in the local space of the adornee, so forward (0,0,-1) will
      be forward relative to the adornee. The offset and rotation of this CFrame
      is applied after any translations due to
      `Class.HandleAdornment.SizeRelativeOffset`.

    summary: |
      The positional offset of the adornment based on the adornee's
      `Class.BasePart.Size`.
    description: |
      The positional offset of the adornment based on the adornee's
      `Class.BasePart.Size`. By default, an adornment draws in the center of its
      adornee. By using this property, the position of the adornment can be
      shifted relative to the center of the adornee. The units of
      **SizeRelativeOffset** are a scale based on the size of the adornee
      itself. This scale is such that a value of 1 will move the adornment to
      the corresponding edge of the adornee. This property is intended to allow
      adornments to easily be moved to the edges of a parts.

      For example, if the **SizeRelativeOffset** is set to (0,1,0), the
      adornment will be drawn with its center at the exact top of the adornee.
      If set to (1,1,1), the adornment will be drawn in the upper corner of the
      adornee.

    summary: |
      The ZIndex property determines the draw order of the HandleAdornment.
    description: |
      The **ZIndex** property determines the draw order of the
      `Class.HandleAdornment`. This **ZIndex** only refers to how the adornment
      will draw relative to other adornments or 3d objects in the workspace.
      This does not relate to the `Class.GuiObject.ZIndex` of GuiObjects.

      The valid values for ZIndex are from -1 to 10. If two HandleAdornments are
      drawn over one another, the one with the higher ZIndex will be drawn. This
      order of drawing will be respected even if the adornment with higher
      ZIndex is behind the other adornment in terms of its position in 3d space.
      If set to -1, ZIndex will force the adornment to draw behind other
      adornments and objects in the Workspace, even if the
      `Class.HandleAdornment.AlwaysOnTop` property for the adornment is true.
