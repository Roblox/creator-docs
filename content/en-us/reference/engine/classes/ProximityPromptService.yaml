  **ProximityPromptService** allows developers to interact with
  `Class.ProximityPrompt` objects in a global way. It may be more convenient to
  listen to events through this service rather than on individual
  `Class.ProximityPrompt` objects.

      Whether `Class.ProximityPrompt|ProximityPrompts` are enabled, and

    description: |
      This property determines whether `Class.ProximityPrompt|ProximityPrompts`
      are enabled, and therefore shown, in-experience. When false, no prompts
      will be shown.

      For example, in a round-based system, you can disable prompts at certain
      points in the experience to disable proximity-based interactions:

      ```lua
      local ProximityPromptService = game:GetService("ProximityPromptService")
      local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

      local enablePrompts = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("EnablePrompts") -- BindableEvent

      -- Connect to the BindableEvent and fire from another script controlling experience logic
      enablePrompts.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(enabled)
      	ProximityPromptService.Enabled = enabled
      end)
      ```
