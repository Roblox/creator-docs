name: AnimationClip
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Represents all types of animation data that the Roblox animation system can
  consume.
description: |
  The non-creatable `Class.AnimationClip` instance type represents abstract
  animation data that can be fed to the Roblox animation system.
  `Class.KeyframeSequence` and `Class.CurveAnimation` are two current instance
  types that inherit from `Class.AnimationClip`.

  There are different ways to represent animation data. To simplify the use of
  Roblox's animation system, all such representations are their own instance
  types but inherit from the `Class.AnimationClip` instance. Animation clips
  published to Roblox via the [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md)
  can be loaded into the Roblox Engine using an `Class.Animation` instance.

      Determines whether the animation stored in this `Class.AnimationClip` is
      intended to loop.
    description: |
      Determines whether the animation stored in this `Class.AnimationClip` is
      intended to loop. When set to true, the animation will continuously repeat
      each time it finishes.

      Note that `Class.AnimationTrack` instances internally load an
      `Class.AnimationClip` when an `Class.Animation` is requested via its
      `Class.Animation.AnimationId|AnimationId`, and the
      `Class.AnimationTrack.Looped` property will default to the original
      `Class.AnimationClip` value. Note also that this value can be overwritten.

    description: |
      Determines which clip takes priority when multiple animations are playing
      simultaneously. Multiple playing animations look to this property to
      figure out which `Class.Keyframe` poses should be played over one another.

      Note that `Class.AnimationTrack` instances internally load an
      `Class.AnimationClip` when an `Class.Animation` is requested via its
      `Class.Animation.AnimationId|AnimationId`, and the
      `Class.AnimationTrack.Priority` property will default to the original
      `Class.AnimationClip` value. Note also that this value can be overwritten.
