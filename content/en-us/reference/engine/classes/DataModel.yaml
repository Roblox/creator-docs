      If the server is not a private server, then this property will be an empty
      string.

      #### Private servers

      Private servers refer to the following:

      - [Private servers](../../../production/monetization/private-servers.md)
        that users can purchase from the games page
      - Reserved servers, private servers created by the developer using
        `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServer()`

      #### PrivateServerId vs JobId

      The PrivateServerId of a server is different from the
      `Class.DataModel.JobId`. The `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId` is the unique
      identifier of the current server instance.

      Private servers (private or reserved servers) can have multiple server
      instances associated with them over time. This is because, although only
      one server instance can be running at once for a private server, new
      server instances can open and close as players join and leave the game.
      For example, no server instance is running when nobody is playing in the
      server. The PrivateServerId will be consistent across all of these server
      instances, and the `Class.DataModel.JobId` will be unique for each one.

      `Class.Player` that owns the
      [private server](../../../production/monetization/private-servers.md) if
      the server is private.

      If the server is a standard or reserved server then this property will be
      set to _0_.

      This property could be used to identify if a `Class.Player` is the owner
      of the private server, for example:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      -- is this a private server?
      if game.PrivateServerId ~= "" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId ~= 0 then

          -- listen for new players being added
          Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)

              -- check if the player is the server owner
              if player.UserId == game.PrivateServerOwnerId then
                  print("The private server owner has joined the game")
              end

    description: |
      This function binds a function to be called prior to the game shutting
      down.

      Multiple functions can be bound using BindToClose if it is called
      repeatedly. The game will wait a maximum of 30 seconds for all bound
      functions to complete running before shutting down. After 30 seconds, the
      game will shut down regardless if all bound functions have completed or
      not.

      Bound functions will be called in parallel, meaning they will run at the
      same time.

      You are advised to use `Class.RunService:IsStudio()` to verify the current
      session is not Roblox Studio. If this is not done, all bound functions
      will be required to complete in offline testing sessions.

      When using the `Class.DataStoreService`, best practice is to bind a
      function saving all unsaved data to `Class.GlobalDataStore|DataStores`
      using BindToClose. Otherwise, data may be lost if the game shuts down
      unexpectedly. For an example of this, refer to the code samples.

      Returns a table containing basic information about the jobs performed by
      the task scheduler.

      In computing, a task scheduler is a system responsible for executing key
      tasks at the appropriate intervals.

      You can also find live task scheduler statistics in the Task Scheduler
      window in Roblox Studio.

      The first entry in the table returned is a reference dictionary containing
      the statistics (or headings) available. It is in the following format:

      ```lua
      {
          ["name"] = "name",
          ["averageDutyCycle"] = "averageDutyCycle",
          ["averageStepsPerSecond"] = "averageStepsPerSecond",
          ["averageStepTime"] = "averageStepTime",
          ["averageError"] = "averageError",
          ["isRunning"] = "isRunning",
      }
      ```

      The subsequent entries in the table returned are dictionaries containing
      the above statistics for jobs performed by the task scheduler. For
      example:

      ```lua
      {
          ["name"] = "Heartbeat",
          ["averageDutyCycle"] = 0,
          ["averageStepsPerSecond"] = 0,
          ["averageStepTime"] = 0,
          ["averageError"] = 0,
          ["isRunning"] = false,
      }

      This method returns an array of `Class.Instance|Instances` associated with

      library. It's not possible to insert `Class.Sound|Sounds` using this
      method as they do not have an `Class.Instance` associated with them and
      have only a content URL.

      Unlike `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()`, `DataModel:GetObjects()` does
      not require an asset to be "trusted," meaning that an asset doesn't need
      to be owned by the logged in user, or created by Roblox, to be inserted.
      However, if the asset is not owned by the logged in user it must be freely
      available.

      Due to this function's security context it can only be used by plugins or
      the command bar. For an alternative that can be used in

      This function returns whether gear of the given `Enum.GearType` is
      permitted to be added to `Class.Player|Players'`
      `Class.StarterGear|StarterGears`. For example:

      ```lua
      local meleeWeaponsAllowed = game:IsGearTypeAllowed(Enum.GearType.MeleeWeapons)
      ```

      Whether gear of a specific `Enum.GearType` is permitted in the game is
      determined in a place's settings page under 'Permissions'. Note, all of a
      gear's associated `Enum.GearType|GearTypes` must be enabled for it to be
      permitted in a place.

      This function returns true if the client has finished loading the game for
      the first time.

      When all initial `Class.Instance|Instances` in the game have finished
      replicating to the client, this function will return true.

      Unless they are parented to `Class.ReplicatedFirst`,
      `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` will not run while the game has not
      loaded. The following snippet, ran from a `Class.LocalScript` in
      `Class.ReplicatedFirst` will yield until the game has loaded:

      This function sets the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId` of the game instance to
      the given _placeId_.

      Setting the `Class.DataModel.PlaceId` is required to access the
      `Class.DataStoreService` when the place is unpublished (for example a
      local .rbxl file). See below for an example. This will only work when the
      _'Enable Studio Access to API Services`_ option is enabled under game
      settings.

      ```lua
      local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

      -- access DataStore 'Data' as place placeId
      game:SetPlaceId(placeId)
      local dataStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("Data")
      ```

      You can use `Class.DataModel:SetUniverseId()` to set the
      `Class.DataModel.GameId` of the game instance. However, it is the
      `Class.DataModel.PlaceId` that must be set to access the
      `Class.DataStoreService`.

      Fires when the user prompts an increase or decrease in graphics quality
      using the hotkeys.

      This event fires under the following conditions:

      - If the user presses F10, this event fires with a _betterQuality_
        argument of _true_
      - If the user presses Shift + F10, this event fires with a _betterQuality_
        argument of _false_

      GraphicsQualityChangeRequest does not provide the current graphics quality
      level or cover all updates to the graphics quality. For example, changes
      made in the core GUI escape menu are not registered. This event is
      intended to be used by Roblox `Class.CoreScript|Core Scripts` to update
      the graphics quality and display notifications.

      You can retrieve a user's `Enum.SavedQualitySetting` using
      `Class.UserGameSettings` with the following snippet:

      ```
      UserSettings():GetService("UserGameSettings").SavedQualityLevel
      ```

      If the user's graphics settings are set to automatic then the
      `Enum.SavedQualitySetting` will be _'Automatic'_. There is currently no
      way for developers to reliably get the current graphics quality level of a
      user's machine.
