      **Version History** section of the place's settings. It is not the current
      version of the Roblox client. This property is 0 for all unpublished

      When a server instance is created for a place, it uses the place's current
      version. If the place is later updated while this server is running, the
      server will remain at its current version.

    description: |
      This property describes the private server ID of the server, if the server
      is a private server.

      If the server is not a private server, then this property will be an empty
      string.

      #### Private servers

      Private servers refer to the following:

      - [Private servers](../../../production/monetization/private-servers.md)
        that users can purchase from the games page
      - Reserved servers, private servers created by the developer using
        `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServerAsync()`

      #### PrivateServerId vs JobId

      The PrivateServerId of a server is different from the
      `Class.DataModel.JobId`. The `Class.DataModel.JobId|JobId` is the unique
      identifier of the current server instance.

      Private servers (private or reserved servers) can have multiple server
      instances associated with them over time. This is because, although only
      one server instance can be running at once for a private server, new
      server instances can open and close as players join and leave the game.
      For example, no server instance is running when nobody is playing in the
      server. The PrivateServerId will be consistent across all of these server
      instances, and the `Class.DataModel.JobId` will be unique for each one.

      See also:

      - `Class.DataModel.PrivateServerOwnerId`, a property describing the owner
        of a private server
      - `Class.TeleportService:ReserveServerAsync()`, a function which creates a
        reserved server

      This property describes the `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` of the
      `Class.Player` that owns the
      [private server](../../../production/monetization/private-servers.md) if
      the server is private.

      If the server is a standard or reserved server then this property will be
      set to `0`.

      This property could be used to identify if a `Class.Player` is the owner
      of the private server, for example:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      -- is this a private server?
      if game.PrivateServerId ~= "" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId ~= 0 then

          -- listen for new players being added
          Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)

              -- check if the player is the server owner
              if player.UserId == game.PrivateServerOwnerId then
                  print("The private server owner has joined the game")
              end
          end)
      end
      ```

    description: |
      Binds a function to be called before the server shuts down. If the bound
      function accepts a parameter, it passes `Enum.CloseReason` specifying the
      reason for the server shutdown.

      You can bind multiple functions by calling
      `Class.DataModel:BindToClose()|BindToClose()` repeatedly. Bound functions
      are called in parallel and run at the same time.

      The experience server waits 30 seconds for all bound functions to stop
      running before it shuts down. After 30 seconds, the server shuts down even
      if functions are still running.

      To verify that the current session is not in Roblox Studio, use
      `Class.RunService:IsStudio()`. This prevents bound functions from
      completing their run in offline testing sessions.

      When you use `Class.DataStoreService`, you should also use `BindToClose`
      to bind a function saving all unsaved data to
      `Class.GlobalDataStore|DataStores`. This prevents data loss if the server
      shuts down unexpectedly.

      See also:

      - `Enum.CloseReason` for reasons for the experience server shutdown.

      Returns a table containing basic information about the jobs performed by
      the task scheduler.

      In computing, a task scheduler is a system responsible for executing key
      tasks at the appropriate intervals.

      You can also find live task scheduler statistics in the Task Scheduler
      window in Roblox Studio.

      The first entry in the table returned is a reference dictionary containing
      the statistics (or headings) available. It is in the following format:

      ```lua
      {
          ["name"] = "name",
          ["averageDutyCycle"] = "averageDutyCycle",
          ["averageStepsPerSecond"] = "averageStepsPerSecond",
          ["averageStepTime"] = "averageStepTime",
          ["averageError"] = "averageError",
          ["isRunning"] = "isRunning",
      }
      ```

      The subsequent entries in the table returned are dictionaries containing
      the above statistics for jobs performed by the task scheduler. For
      example:

      ```lua
      {
          ["name"] = "Heartbeat",
          ["averageDutyCycle"] = 0,
          ["averageStepsPerSecond"] = 0,
          ["averageStepTime"] = 0,
          ["averageError"] = 0,
          ["isRunning"] = false,
      }

      Unlike `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()`, `DataModel:GetObjects()` does
      not require an asset to be "trusted," meaning that an asset doesn't need
      to be owned by the logged in user, or created by Roblox, to be inserted.
      However, if the asset is not owned by the logged in user it must be freely
      available.

      Due to this function's security context it can only be used by plugins or
      the command bar. For an alternative that can be used in
      `Class.Script|Scripts` and `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, see
      `Class.InsertService:LoadAsset()`.

      This function returns whether gear of the given `Enum.GearType` is
      permitted to be added to `Class.Player|Players'`
      `Class.StarterGear|StarterGears`. For example:

      ```lua

      ```

      Whether gear of a specific `Enum.GearType` is permitted in the game is
      determined in a place's settings page under 'Permissions'. Note, all of a
      gear's associated `Enum.GearType|GearTypes` must be enabled for it to be
      permitted in a place.

      Fires when the user prompts an increase or decrease in graphics quality
      using the hotkeys.

      This event fires under the following conditions:

      - If the user presses <kbd>F10</kbd>, this event fires with a
        `betterQuality` argument of `true`.
      - If the user presses <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F10</kbd>, this event fires
        with a `betterQuality` argument of `false`.

      This event does not provide the current graphics quality level or cover
      all updates to the graphics quality. For example, changes made in the core
      GUI escape menu are not registered.

      You can retrieve a user's `Enum.SavedQualitySetting` using
      `Class.UserGameSettings` with the following snippet:

      ```lua
      UserSettings():GetService("UserGameSettings").SavedQualityLevel
      ```

      If the user's graphics settings are set to automatic then the
      `Enum.SavedQualitySetting` will be
      `Enum.SavedQualitySetting.Automatic|Automatic`. There is currently no way
      for developers to reliably get the current graphics quality level of a
