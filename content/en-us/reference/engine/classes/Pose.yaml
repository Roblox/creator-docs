  A Pose holds the `Datatype.CFrame` applied to the `Class.Motor6D` connected to
  its associated `Class.BasePart`. The part which is controlled depends on the
  name of the Pose.

  Poses are the fundamental building blocks of animations and, with `Keyframes`,
  make up `KeyframeSequences`.

  ## Poses, joints and hierarchy

  Although a Pose is assigned to a `Class.BasePart` by name, the object
  manipulated during animation playback is actually the `Class.Motor6D`
  connected to this part. Animation rigs branch out from the model's root part
  through such joints.

  In a R15 character rig, the root part is the HumanoidRootPart. The LowerTorso
  is connected to the HumanoidRootPart by the a motor named 'Root'. Therefore,
  the `Datatype.CFrame` of a Pose named 'LowerTorso' in a `Class.Keyframe` would
  be applied to the motor named 'Root', and not the LowerTorso itself.

  Poses are arranged in a `Class.Keyframe` based on joint hierarchy. This means,
  the Pose's `Datatype.CFrame` is applied to the motor connecting the part
  associated with the pose to the part associated with the pose's parent. See
  below for a visual example of the structure of Poses on a R15 character.

  ## Pose CFrame

  The Roblox animation system applies `Class.Pose.CFrame` to the corresponding
  `Class.Motor6D` by manipulating the relative transformation of the motor, the
  `Class.Motor6D.Transform` property. The original `Class.JointInstance.C1|C0`
  and `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` values are not changed.

      `Class.Pose` objects are arranged in a `Class.Keyframe` based on joint
      hierarchy. This means, that the `Class.Pose.CFrame` is applied to the
      motor connecting the part associated with the pose to the part associated
      with the pose's parent.

      Adds a sub `Class.Pose` to the `Class.Pose` by parenting it to it. It is
      functionally identical to setting the new pose's `Class.Instance.Parent`
      to the pose.

      Note, this function will not error when an instance other than a
      `Class.Pose` is given as the pose parameter and will parent it
      successfully.
