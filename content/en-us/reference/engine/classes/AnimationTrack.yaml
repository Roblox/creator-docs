      This property can be used to check if an animation is already playing
      before playing it (as that would cause it to restart). If you want to
      obtain all playing `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` on an
      `Class.Animator` or a `Class.Humanoid`, they should use
      `Class.Animator:GetPlayingAnimationTracks()`

      This property sets whether the animation will repeat after finishing. If
      it is changed while playing the result will take effect after the
      animation finishes.

      This property defaults to how it was set in the
      [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md). However, this property
      can be changed, allowing control over the `Class.AnimationTrack` while it
      is running. This property also correctly handles animations played in
      reverse (negative `Class.AnimationTrack.Speed`). After the first keyframe
      is reached, it will restart at the last keyframe.

      This property sets the priority of an `Class.AnimationTrack`. Depending on
      what this is set to, playing multiple animations at once will look to this
      property to figure out which `Class.Keyframe` poses should be played over
      one another. It uses `Enum.AnimationPriority` which has 7 priority levels:

      1. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Action4` (highest priority)
      2. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Action3`
      3. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Action2`
      4. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Action`
      5. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Movement`
      6. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Idle`
      7. `Enum.AnimationPriority|Core` (lowest priority)

      Properly set animation priorities, either through the
      [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md) or through this property,
      allow multiple animations to be played without them clashing. Where two
      playing animations direct the target to move the same limb in different
      ways, the `Class.AnimationTrack` with the highest priority will show. If
      both animations have the same priority, the weights of the tracks will be
      used to combine the animations.

      If the speed is adjusted through `Class.AnimationTrack:AdjustSpeed()`, the

      length by the speed. Speed is a unitless quantity.

      This method changes the `Class.AnimationTrack.Speed` of an animation. A

      A track's initial speed is set as a parameter in
      `Class.AnimationTrack:Play()`. However a track's
      `Class.AnimationTrack.Speed` can be changed during playback using this
      method. When speed is equal to `1`, the amount of time an animation takes
      to complete is equal to `Class.AnimationTrack.Length` (in seconds).

      When is adjusted, then the actual time it will take a track to play can be
      computed by dividing the length by the speed. `Class.AnimationTrack.Speed`
      is a unitless quantity.

      Changes the weight of an animation, with the optional `fadeTime` parameter
      determining how long it takes for `Class.AnimationTrack.WeightCurrent` to

      When weight is set in an `Class.AnimationTrack` it does not change

      `Class.AnimationTrack.WeightTarget`. The time it takes to do this is
      determined by the `fadeTime` parameter given when the animation is played,
      or the weight is adjusted.

      The animation weighting system is used to determine how
      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` playing at the same priority are
      blended together. The default weight is `1`, and no movement will be
      visible on an `Class.AnimationTrack` with a weight of `0`. The pose that
      is shown at any point in time is determined by the weighted average of all
      the `Class.Pose|Poses` and the `Class.AnimationTrack.WeightCurrent` of
      each `Class.AnimationTrack`. See below for an example of animation
      blending in practice. In most cases blending animations is not required
      and using `Class.AnimationTrack.Priority` is more suitable.

      The speed the `Class.AnimationTrack` will play at is determined by the

      number of seconds the track will take to complete is equal to the track's
      `Class.AnimationTrack.Length` property. For example, a speed of `2` will
      cause the track to play twice as fast.

      The weight and speed of the animation can also be changed after the
      animation has begun playing by using the
      `Class.AnimationTrack:AdjustWeight()` and
      `Class.AnimationTrack:AdjustSpeed()` methods.

      If you want to start the animation at a specific point using
      `Class.AnimationTrack.TimePosition`, it's important the animation is

  - name: AnimationTrack:Stop
    summary: |
      Stops the `Class.AnimationTrack`.
    description: |
      Stops the `Class.AnimationTrack`. Once called, the weight of the animation
      will move towards zero over a length of time specified by the optional
      `fadeTime` parameter. For example, if `Stop()` is called with a `fadeTime`
      of `2`, it will take two seconds for the weight of the track to reach zero
      and its effects completely end. Please note this will be the case
      regardless of the initial weight of the animation.

      It is not recommended to use a `fadeTime` of `0` in an attempt to override
      this effect and end the animation immediately for `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds`
      that have their `Class.Motor.MaxVelocity` set to zero, as this causes the
      joints to freeze in place. If it must end immediately, ensure the
      `Class.Motor.MaxVelocity` of `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds` in your rig are high
      enough for them to snap properly.

      This event fires whenever a looped `Class.AnimationTrack` completes a
      loop, on the next update.

      Currently it may also fire at the exact end of a non looped animation
      track but this behavior should not be relied upon.

      Fires when the `Class.AnimationTrack` is completely done moving anything
      in the world, meaning the animation has finished playing, the "fade out"
      is finished, and the subject is in a neutral pose.

      You can use this to take action when the animation track's subject is back
      in a neutral pose that's unaffected by the `Class.AnimationTrack` or to
      clean up the `Class.AnimationTrack`.

      Fires every time playback of an `Class.AnimationTrack` reaches a
      `Class.Keyframe` that does not have the default name of `Keyframe`. This
      event lets you run code at predefined points in an animation (set by
      `Class.Keyframe` names).

      `Class.Keyframe` names do not need to be unique. For example, if an
      animation has three keyframes named `Particles`, this event will fire each
      time one of these keyframes is reached.

      `Class.Keyframe` names can be set in the
      [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md) when creating or editing
      an animation. They cannot however be set by a `Class.Script` on an
      existing animation prior to playing it.

    summary: |
      Fires when the `Class.AnimationTrack` finishes playing. The AnimationTrack
      might still animate the subject while the animation "fades out". To catch
      when the AnimationTrack is completely done moving anything in the world,
      use the `Class.AnimationTrack.Ended` event.
    description: |
      Fires whenever the `Class.AnimationTrack` finishes playing.

      This event has a number of uses. It can be used to wait until an
      `Class.AnimationTrack` has stopped before continuing (for example, if
      chaining a series of animations to play after each other). It can also be
      used to clean up any `Class.Instance|Instances` created during the
      animation playback.
