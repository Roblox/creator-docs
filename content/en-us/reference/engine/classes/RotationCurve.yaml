summary: |
  Represents a sequence of rotations and the interpolation curve between them.
description: |
  This class holds a sorted list of
  `Datatype.RotationCurveKey|RotationCurveKeys` that represent a sequence of
  rotations. The shape of the interpolation curve between two keys is determined
  by the `Datatype.RotationCurveKey.Interpolation` type.

  - name: RotationCurve:GetKeyIndicesAtTime
    summary: |
      Returns the index of the last and first key of a period of time.
    description: |
      The first item in the returned array is the index of the last key with
      time less than or equal to `time` (or the lesser of either 1 or the curve
      length if no key was found). The second item in the returned array is the
      index of the first key with time greater than or equal to `time` (or the
      curve length if no key was found satisfying the inequality).

    description: |
      Adds the key passed as an argument to this curve. If a key at the same
      time is found, it will be replaced. In the returned array, the first value
      is `true` if a key was added or `false` if a previous key was replaced;
      the second value is the index at which the marker was added.

  - name: RotationCurve:SetKeys
    summary: |
      Resets this curve's keys using the `Datatype.RotationCurveKey` array passed as an argument.
    description: |
      Resets this curve's keys using the `Datatype.RotationCurveKey` array
      passed as an argument. Keys in the `keys` array are sorted in ascending
      time order before insertion, and keys at duplicated times are removed in a
      stable manner.
      
      Returns the number of keys actually inserted. Keys previously stored in
      this curve are removed before the keys passed as arguments are added.
