summary: |
  Represents a sequence of rotations and the interpolation curve between them.
description: |
  This class holds a sorted list of `RotationCurveKey|RotationCurveKeys` that
  represent a sequence of rotations. The shape of the interpolation curve
  between two RotationCurveKeys is determined by the RotationCurveKey
  interpolation type. RotationCurve provides a sampling method `GetValueAtTime`
  returning its result as the rotation component of a CFrame.

  - name: RotationCurve:GetKeyIndicesAtTime
    summary: |
      Returns the index of the last and first key of a period of time.
    description: |
      The first returned value is the index of the last key with
      `key.time <= time` (or `min(1,length`) if no key was found). The second
      returned value is the index of the first key with `key.time >= time` (or
      the length of the curve if no key was found satisfying the inequality).

      Adds the key passed as argument to this curve. If a key at the same time
      is found it will be replaced. First return value is true if a key was
      added, false if a previous key was replaced. Second return value is the
      index at which the marker was added.

      Resets this curve keys using the RotationCurveKey array passed as
      argument. Keys in the keysArray are sorted in ascending time order before
      insertion. Keys at duplicated times are removed in a stable manner.
      Returns the number of keys actually inserted. Keys previously stored in
      this curve are removed before the keys passed as arguments are added.
