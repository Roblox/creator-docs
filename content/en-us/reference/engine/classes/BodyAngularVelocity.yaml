summary: |
  Applies a torque to maintain a constant angular velocity.
description: |
  The `BodyAngularVelocity` object applies a torque (rotational force) on an
  assembly such that it maintains a constant angular velocity as determined by
  its `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` property. This
  allows for the creation of assemblies that continually rotate. It is the
  rotational counterpart to a `Class.BodyVelocity`. If you would like to
  maintain a constant angular displacement, use a `Class.BodyGyro` instead.

    summary: |
      Determines the axis of rotation (direction) and the rotational velocity
      (magnitude) in radians/s.
    description: |
      This property is a `Datatype.Vector3` which determines the goal angular
      velocity a `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` should maintain through the
      exertion of torque. For this property, the direction of the vector is the
      axis of rotation. The magnitude is the angular velocity in **radians per
      second**.

      You can multiply a `Datatype.Vector3` by `Library.math.rad(360)`, or `2Ï€`,
      in order to convert angular frequency (rotations per second) into the
      desired angular velocity (radians per second).

      This property determines the limit of the torque that may be exerted on
      each world axis. If an assembly isn't moving, consider raising this value
      and also check that it is not `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or
      attached to another anchored assembly). See also
      `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.P|P` (power).

    summary: |
      Determines how aggressive of a torque is applied in reaching the goal
      angular velocity.
    description: |
      This property determines how much power is used while applying torque in
      order to reach the goal
      `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity`. The higher
      this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
