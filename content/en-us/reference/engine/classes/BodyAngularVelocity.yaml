  Applies a torque to maintain a constant angular velocity.
description: |
  The BodyAngularVelocity object applies a [torque][1] (or **rotational force**)
  on a `Class.BasePart` such that it maintains a constant [angular velocity][3]
  as determined by its
  `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` property. This
  allows for the creation of parts that continually rotate. It is the rotational
  counterpart to a `Class.BodyVelocity`. If you would like to maintain a
  constant [angular displacement][2], use a `Class.BodyGyro` instead.

  - name: BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity
    summary: |
      Determines the axis of rotation (direction) and the rotational velocity
      (magnitude) in radians/s.
    description: |
      The AngularVelocity property is a `Datatype.Vector3` which determines the
      goal angular velocity a `Class.BodyAngularVelocity` should maintain
      through the exertion of torque. For this property, the direction of the
      vector is the axis of rotation. The magnitude is the angular velocity in
      **radians per second**. By default, this property is `(0, 2, 0)`.

      **Tip:** You can multiply a `Datatype.Vector3` by `Library.math.rad(360)`,
      or **2π**, in order to convert [angular frequency][5] (rotations per
      second) into the desired [angular velocity][3] (radians per second). For
      example: Setting
      `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` to
      `Vector3.new(0, 1, 0) * math.rad(360)` ≈ `Vector3.new(0, 6.283, 0)` will
      cause a part to spin around the Y axis once per second.

    description: |
      The MaxTorque property determines the limit of the torque that may be
      exerted on each world axis. If a part isn't moving, consider raising this
      value (and also check that it is not `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or
      attached to another anchored part). See also
      `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.P|P` (power).

      angular velocity.
    description: |
      The P property determines how much
      [power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
      applying torque in order to reach the goal
      `Class.BodyAngularVelocity.AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity`. The higher
      this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
