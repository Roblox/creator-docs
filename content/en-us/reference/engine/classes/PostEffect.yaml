summary: |
  Abstract base class for post-processing effects.
description: |
  PostEffect is an abstract base class for post-processing effects, such as
  `Class.BloomEffect` and `Class.ColorCorrectionEffect`. They change how the
  world looks **after** it has been rendered. They do not affect
  `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects`. Objects of this kind should be parented to the
  `Class.Lighting` or the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` in order to work.

  It should also be noted that some post-processing effects will work
  differently or **not at all** when Roblox is set to a low
  `Class.RenderSettings.QualityLevel|QualityLevel` (or
  `Class.RenderSettings.EditQualityLevel|EditQualityLevel` in Studio). On some
  low-end devices, faster rendering algorithms may be used. By default, these
  quality settings are set to Automatic, so if you aren't seeing post-processing
  effects you should check Roblox's settings under the "Rendering" section. It
  may be necessary to override the automatic behavior temporarily in order to
  preview post-processing effects.
