summary: ''
description: |
  `PluginAction` represents a generic performable action in Studio with no
  directly‑associated `Class.PluginToolbarButton`. If
  `Class.PluginAction.AllowBinding|AllowBinding` is `true`, the action can be
  assigned a keyboard shortcut through Studio's **File**&nbsp;⟩ **Customize
  Shortcuts** window.

  A `PluginAction` must be created using the `Class.Plugin:CreatePluginAction()`
  method in order to work as expected.
