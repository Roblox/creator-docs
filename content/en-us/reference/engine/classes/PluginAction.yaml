  PluginAction is an object that represents a generic performable action in
  Roblox Studio, with no directly associated `Toolbar` or `Enum.Button`. In
  Roblox Studio, they can be assigned a keyboard shortcut under
  `File → Advanced → Customize Shortcuts...`, and they can also be added to the
  Quick Access Toolbar.

  PluginActions must be created using the `Class.Plugin:CreatePluginAction()`
  function in order to work as expected.
