name: BindableFunction
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object which allows for synchronous two-way communication between scripts
  on the same side of the client-server boundary. Scripts invoking a
  `Class.BindableFunction` yield until the corresponding callback is found.
description: |
  The **BindableFunction** object allows for synchronous two-way communication
  between scripts on the same side of the
  [client-server](../../../projects/client-server.md) boundary. You can use it
  to define a custom callback function and invoke it manually by calling
  `Class.BindableFunction:Invoke()`. The code invoking the function **yields**
  until the corresponding callback is found, and the callback receives the
  arguments that you passed to `Class.BindableFunction:Invoke()|Invoke()`. If
  the callback was never set, the script that invokes it will not resume
  execution.

  As an alternative for one-way communication between two scripts on the same
  side of the client-server boundary, consider `Class.BindableEvent` which does
  **not** yield for a return.

  As stated, `Class.BindableFunction|BindableFunctions` do not allow for
  communication between the server and clients. If you are looking for this
  functionality, use a `Class.RemoteFunction` as outlined in
  [Remote events and callbacks](../../../scripting/events/remote.md).

  See [Bindable events and callbacks](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md) for
  code samples and further details on `Class.BindableFunction`.

  #### Parameter Limitations

  Any type of Roblox object such as an `Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, or
  others can be passed as a parameter when a `Class.BindableFunction` is
  invoked, as well as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans,
  although you should carefully explore the
  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/bindable.md#argument-limitations).

      Only one function can be bound to
      `Class.BindableFunction:Invoke()|Invoke()` at a time. If you assign
      multiple functions, only the last one assigned will be used.

    description: |
      This callback is called when the `Class.BindableFunction` is invoked with
      `Class.BindableFunction:Invoke()|Invoke()`. It can be set multiple times
      but cannot be called directly. Invocations will yield until this callback
      is found and, if it is never set, the script that invoked it will not
      resume execution.
