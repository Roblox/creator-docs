  Represents a speaker in a `Class.TextChannel`.

  `Class.TextSource|TextSources` provide details on permissions users have in
  `Class.TextChannel|TextChannels`. There may be multiple
  `Class.TextSource|TextSources` for a user if that user belongs in multiple
  `Class.TextChannel|TextChannels`.

  Create `Class.TextSource|TextSources` with `Class.TextChannel:AddUserAsync()`,
  which adds a `Class.TextSource` to the `Class.TextChannel` as a descendant.

  Remove `Class.TextSource|TextSources` by calling `Class.TextSource.Destroy`.

  Name of a `Class.TextSource` is the `Class.Player.DisplayName` of the user
  associated with the `Class.TextSource` via `Class.TextSource.UserId`.

  To learn more about using TextSources, see
  [In-Experience Text Chat](../../../chat/customizing-in-experience-text-chat.md).
