name: MemoryStoreQueue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Provides access to a queue within MemoryStore.
description: |
  Provides access to a queue within MemoryStore. A queue is a data structure
  that provides temporary storage for arbitrary items (up to the maximum item
  size -- see
  [MemoryStore Limits](../../../cloud-services/memory-stores/index.md#limits-and-quotas)).
  Each queue item has a numeric priority: MemoryStore retrieves items with
  higher priority from the queue first, and it retrieves Items with the same
  priority in order of addition.

  Items in the queue can optionally be set to expire after a certain amount of
  time. Expired items simply disappear from the queue as if they were never
  added.

        summary: |
          Item priority. Items with higher priority are retrieved from the queue
          before items with lower priority.

    summary: |
      Reads one or more items from the queue.
    description: |
      Reads one or more items from the queue as a single atomic operation.

      This method does not automatically delete the returned items from the
      queue but makes them invisible to other ReadAsync calls for the period of
      the invisibility timeout. The items must be explicitly removed from the
      queue with `Class.MemoryStoreQueue:RemoveAsync()` before the invisibility
      timeout expires. The invisibility timeout defaults to 30 seconds unless a
      different value was provided in `Class.MemoryStoreService:GetQueue()`.

    parameters:
      - name: count
        type: int
        default:
        summary: |
          Number of items to read. The maximum allowed value of this parameter
          is 100.
      - name: allOrNothing
        type: boolean
        default: false
        summary: |
          Controls the behavior of the method in the case the queue has fewer
          than `count` items: if set to false the method returns all available
          items; if set to true, it returns no items. The default value is
          false.
      - name: waitTimeout
        type: double
        default: -1
        summary: |
          The duration, in seconds, for which the method will wait if the
          required number of items is not immediately available in the queue.
          Reads are attempted every two seconds during this period. This
          parameter can be set to zero to indicate no wait. If this parameter is
          not provided or set to -1, the method will wait indefinitely.
    returns:
      - type: Tuple
        summary: |
          A tuple of two elements. The first element is an array of item values
          read from the queue. The second element is a string identifier that
          should be passed to `Class.MemoryStoreQueue:RemoveAsync()` to
          permanently remove these items from the queue.

    description: |
      Removes an item or items previously read from the queue. This method uses
      the identifier returned by `Class.MemoryStoreQueue:ReadAsync()` to
      identify the items to remove. If called after the invisibility timeout has
      expired, the call has no effect.
