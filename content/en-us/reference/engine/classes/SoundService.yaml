  A service that determines various aspects of how `Class.Sound|Sounds` play in
  the experience. `Class.SoundService` is also often used to store
  `Class.SoundGroup|SoundGroups`, although this is not mandatory for groups to
  work.

  `Class.SoundService` properties such as
  `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb|AmbientReverb`,
  `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor|DistanceFactor`,
  `Class.SoundService.DopplerScale|DopplerScale` and
  `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale|RolloffScale` can be used to change how all
  `Class.Sound|Sounds` play in the experience, and the
  `Class.SoundService:SetListener()|SetListener()` function allows you to set
  the position from where sounds are heard.

    summary: |
      The ambient sound environment preset used by `Class.SoundService`.
    description: |
      Each `Enum.ReverbType` option for this property corresponds to a preset
      available in the FMOD sound engine. For example, when
      `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb|AmbientReverb` is set to
      `Enum.ReverbType.Hangar`, sound will reverberate differently to simulate
      being in a large enclosed space.

      Changing `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb|AmbientReverb` affects the
      following properties used by Roblox's sound engine.

      - Reverberation decay time.
      - Initial reflection delay time.
      - Late reverberation delay time relative to initial reflection.
      - Reference high frequency.
      - High-frequency to mid-frequency decay time ratio.
      - Value that controls the echo density in the late reverberation decay.
      - Value that controls the modal density in the late reverberation decay.
      - Reference low frequency.
      - Relative room effect level at low frequencies.
      - Relative room effect level at high frequencies.
      - Early reflections level relative to room effect.
      - Room effect level at mid frequencies.

      Determines where to place an `Class.AudioListener` by default.
      If `Class.SoundService.DefaultListenerLocation` is `None`, then no `Class.AudioListener` will be created by default, but `Class.AudioListeners` can be created separately by scripts.
      If `Class.SoundService.DefaultListenerLocation` is `Camera`, then
      - an `Class.AudioListener` will be created and parented to `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`
      - an `Class.AudioDeviceOutput` will be created and parented to `Class.SoundService`
      - a `Class.Wire` will be created and parented to the previously-created `Class.AudioListener`
      - `Class.Wire.SourceInstance` will be set to the previously-created `Class.AudioListener`, and `Class.Wire.TargetInstance` will be set to the previously-created `Class.AudioDeviceOutput`
      As a result, the world will be heard from the perspective (postition and orientation) of your camera.

      If `Class.SoundService.DefaultListenerLocation` is `Character`, then
      - an `Class.Attachment` will be created and parented to your `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`'s `Class.Player.Character`'s `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`
      - an `Class.AudioListener` will be created and parented to the `Class.Attachment`
      - an `Class.AudioDeviceOutput` will be created and parented to `Class.SoundService`
      - a `Class.Wire` will be created and parented to the previously-created `Class.AudioListener`
      - `Class.Wire.SourceInstance` will be set to the previously-created `Class.AudioListener`, and `Class.Wire.TargetInstance` will be set to the previously-created `Class.AudioDeviceOutput`
      - the previously-created `Class.Attachment` will be updated once-per-frame to face the same direction as `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`
      As a result, the world will be heard from the position of your character, while matching the orientation of your camera.

      If `Class.SoundService.DefaultListenerLocation` is `Default`, then its behavior depends on the value of `Class.VoiceChatService.EnableDefaultVoice` and `Class.VoiceChatService.UseAudioApi`.
      When using the default voice setup with the audio API, this behaves similarly to `Camera`.

      The number of studs to be considered a meter by `Class.SoundService` when
      calculating volume attenuation of `Class.Sound|Sounds` parented to a
      `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`.

      By default, this property is `3.33`, meaning that a meter is considered
      3.33 studs for the purposes of volume attenuation. The greater the
      `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor|DistanceFactor`, the more gradually
      sound will attenuate.

      It's recommended that you only change this property if your experience
      uses a different scale. For example, when using larger custom characters,
      you may want to reduce `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor|DistanceFactor`.

    description: |
      This property determines the degree to which the pitch of a `Class.Sound`
      varies due to the Doppler effect, a phenomenon whereby the pitch of a
      sound changes as the source and observer of the sound move further away or
      closer together. Only affects `Class.Sound|Sounds` that are parented to a
      `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`.

      Increasing this value exaggerates the impact of the Doppler effect,
      whereas decreasing it minimizes it. By default, the value of this property
      is `1`.

    description: |
      This property determines whether `Class.Sound` playback is replicated from
      the client to the server, and therefore from the server. In other words,
      when a `Class.LocalScript` calls `Class.Sound:Play()|Play()` and this
      property is `true`, the sound will only play on the respective client. If
      this property is `false`, other clients will also hear the sound.

      Default is `true`, meaning filtering is enabled.

      Sets how fast `Class.Sound` volume attenuates. The higher the
      `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale|RolloffScale`, the more rapidly a sound's
      volume will attenuate as the distance between the listener and the sound
      increases.

      Note that this property only applies to `Class.Sound|Sounds` whose
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMode|RollOffMode` property is set to
      `Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse|Inverse` (default) or
      `Enum.RollOffMode.InverseTapered|InverseTapered`.
      `Enum.RollOffMode.Linear|Linear` and
      `Enum.RollOffMode.LinearSquare|LinearSquare` modes use a different
      attenuation model which is not influenced by this property. This property
      also has no impact on `Class.Sound|Sounds` which are not parented to a
      `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`.

      This method returns the `Class.SoundService` current listener type and
      what is set as the listener, meaning the point from which audio in the
      experience is "heard" by the player. By default, the listener is set to
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. The listener can be changed using
      `Class.SoundService:SetListener()|SetListener()`.

      The first result returned is the listener's `Enum.ListenerType` and the
      second result is dependent on that type:
