  A service that determines various aspects of how the audio engine works. Most
  of its properties affect how `Class.Sound|Sounds` play in the experience,
  while others affect the behavior of instances in the advanced audio system
  such as `Class.AudioPlayer|AudioPlayers` and
  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters`.

  `Class.SoundService` is also often used to store
  `Class.SoundGroup|SoundGroups`, although this is not mandatory for groups to
  work.

      Determines whether acoustic simulation is enabled globally in the advanced

    description: |
      Determines at a global level whether sound from
      `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` and
      `Class.AudioListener|AudioListeners` should automatically implement
      features of acoustic simulation, such as occlusion (being muffled through
      walls), diffraction (bending around corners), and reverberation (echoing
      off of walls).

      If set to `false`, these instances will not simulate these features,
      regardless of their individual
      `Class.AudioEmitter.AcousticSimulationEnabled|AcousticSimulationEnabled`
      settings.

    description: |
      A reverb preset that should be applied to all `Class.Sound|Sounds` in the
      experience.

      Each `Enum.ReverbType` option for this property corresponds to a preset
      available in the FMOD sound engine. For example, when
      `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb|AmbientReverb` is set to
      `Enum.ReverbType.Hangar`, `Class.Sound|Sounds` will have reverb applied to
      simulate being in a large enclosed space.

      Note that this only affects `Class.Sound|Sounds` and **not** instances in
      the advanced audio system such as `Class.AudioPlayer|AudioPlayers` and
      `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters`. See `Class.AudioReverb` for a way to
      apply reverb in that system.

    summary: |
      The number of studs to be considered a meter by `Class.SoundService` when

    description: |
      The number of studs to be considered a meter by `Class.SoundService` when
      simulating the Doppler effect for `Class.Sound|Sounds`. This impacts any
      `Class.Sound` parented to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`.

      By default, this property is `3.33`, meaning that a meter is considered
      3.33 studs for the purposes of simulating the Doppler effect. The greater
      the `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor|DistanceFactor`, the faster the
      listener has to travel relative to `Class.Sound|Sounds` in order to
      experience the same Doppler shift.

      It's recommended that you only change this property if the objects in your
      experience are scaled differently from what they represent. For example,
      if your character is meant to be very small (but is normal-sized in the
      engine), you may want to increase `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor`.

      Note that this does not impact the behavior of instances in the advanced
      audio system, such as `Class.AudioPlayer` or `Class.AudioEmitter`.

      Degree to which the pitch of a `Class.Sound` varies due to the Doppler
      effect.
    description: |
      This property determines the degree to which the pitch of a `Class.Sound`
      varies due to the Doppler effect. This impacts any `Class.Sound` parented
      to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`.

      The Doppler effect is a phenomenon whereby the pitch of a sound changes as
      the source and observer of the sound move further away or closer together,
      which is stronger the more quickly they are moving. Increasing
      `Class.SoundService.DopplerScale` exaggerates the impact of this effect,
      whereas decreasing it minimizes it. By default, the value of this property
      is `1`.

      Note that this does not impact the behavior of instances in the advanced
      audio system, such as `Class.AudioPlayer` or `Class.AudioEmitter`.

    description: |
      This property determines whether `Class.Sound` playback is replicated from
      the client to the server, and therefore from the server. In other words,
      when a `Class.LocalScript` calls `Class.Sound:Play()|Play()` and this
      property is `true`, the sound will only play on the respective client. If
      this property is `false`, other clients will also hear the sound.

      Default is `true`, meaning filtering is enabled.

      Determines how fast the volume of a spatialized `Class.Sound` attenuates.
      This impacts any `Class.Sound` parented to a `Class.BasePart` or
      `Class.Attachment`.

      A higher `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale|RolloffScale` means the volume
      of a `Class.Sound` will attenuate more rapidly as the distance between the
      listener and the `Class.Sound|Sound` grows. More precisely, the volume of
      the `Class.Sound` will still start attenuating at a distance equal to
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMinDistance`, but the attenuation curve will be
      steeper or more gradual based on the value of
      `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale|RolloffScale`. Note that the
      `Class.Sound` will still be inaudible past its the
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMaxDistance` regardless of the value of
      `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale`.

      Note that this property does not affect the behavior of instances in the
      advanced audio system, such as `Class.AudioEmitter`. See
      `Class.AudioEmitter:SetDistanceAttenuation` for a way to apply custom
      attenuation in that system.

      `Class.Part`.
