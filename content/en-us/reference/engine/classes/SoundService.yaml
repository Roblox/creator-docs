  A service that determines various aspects of how `Class.Sound`s play in the
  game. SoundService is also often used to store `Class.SoundGroup`s although
  this is not mandatory for `Class.SoundGroup`s to work.

  ## What can SoundService do?

  SoundService properties such as `Class.SoundService.AmbientReverb`,
  `Class.SoundService.DistanceFactor`, `Class.SoundService.DopplerScale` and
  `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale` can be used to change how all `Class.Sound`s
  play in the game.

  The `Class.SoundService:SetListener()` function allows developers to set the
  position where sounds are heard from.

  `Class.SoundService:PlayLocalSound()` can be used to play a sound locally
  regardless of where it is parented to.

  Developers looking to find out more about how sound works in Roblox should
  consult the documentation provided for the
  [FMOD sound engine](https://www.fmod.com/docs/api/content/generated/overview/3dsound.html).

      The ambient sound environment preset used by `Class.SoundService`.
    description: |
      The ambient sound environment preset used by `Class.SoundService`.

      The `Enum.ReverbType` this property simulates a range of different
      environment's impact on sound. Each different option corresponds with a
      preset available in the FMOD sound engine. For example, when AmbientReverb
      is set to Hangar, the sound will reverberate differently to simulate being
      in a large enclosed space.

      Changing the AmbientReverb effects the following properties used by
      Roblox's sound engine.

      - Reverberation decay time
      - Initial reflection delay time
      - Late reverberation delay time relative to initial reflection
      - Reference high frequency
      - High-frequency to mid-frequency decay time ratio
      - Value that controls the echo density in the late reverberation decay
      - Value that controls the modal density in the late reverberation decay
      - Reference low frequency
      - Relative room effect level at low frequencies
      - Relative room effect level at high frequencies
      - Early reflections level relative to room effect
      - Room effect level at mid frequencies

      Those interested in finding more out about ambient reverb presets should
      see the
      [FMOD documentation on the topic](https://www.fmod.com/docs/api/content/generated/FMOD_REVERB_PRESETS.html).
      For most developers however, the `Enum.ReverbType` names are descriptive
      enough to be able to use this setting without advanced knowledge.

      The number of studs to be considered a meter by `Class.SoundService` when

    description: |
      The number of studs to be considered a meter by `Class.SoundService` when
      calculating 3D `Class.Sound` volume attenuation.

      By default, the DistanceFactor is 3.33. This means, for the purposes of
      volume attenuation, a meter is considered 3.33 studs. The greater the
      DistanceFactor, the more gradually sound will attenuate.

      ```
      local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
      SoundService.DistanceFactor = 1 -- 1 meter = 1 stud
      SoundService.DistanceFactor = 10 -- 1 meter = 10 studs
      ```

      Developers are advised to only change this property if their game uses a
      different scale. For example, when using larger custom characters,
      developers may want to reduce the DistanceFactor. In all other cases,
      `Class.Sound` settings such as `Class.Sound.RollOffMode` should be used
      instead.

    description: |
      This property determines the degree to which a 3D `Class.Sound` object's
      pitch varies due to the Doppler effect.

      The Doppler effect describes a phenomenon whereby the pitch of a sound
      changes as the source and observer of the sound move further away, or
      closer together. The Doppler effect can often be seen in real life, such
      as when a car with a siren drives past.

      Increasing this value exaggerates the impact of the Doppler effect,
      whereas decreasing it minimizes it. By default, the value of this property
      is 1.

      ```
      local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
      SoundService.DopplerScale = 1 -- default
      SoundService.DopplerScale = 2 -- exaggerated Doppler effect
      SoundService.DopplerEffect = 0.5 -- subdued Doppler effect
      ```

      Note the Doppler effect has no impact on 2D `Class.Sound`s,
      (`Class.Sound`s not parented to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`).

      The **RespectFilteringEnabled** property determines whether `Class.Sound`
      playback is replicated from the client to the server, and therefore from
      server. In other words, when a `Class.LocalScript` calls
      `Class.Sound:Play()` and this property is **true**, the sound will only
      play on the respective client. If the property is false, other clients
      will also hear the sound.

      Sets how fast 3D `Class.Sound` volume attenuates, or 'rolls off'.

      Note, this property only applies to `Class.Sound`s whose
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMode` property is set to 'Inverse' or
      'InverseTapered'. 'Linear' and 'LinearSquare' `Enum.RollOffMode`s use a
      different attenuation model which is not influenced by this property. This
      property also has no impact on 2D sounds (`Class.Sound`s not parented to a
      `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`).

      The higher the RolloffScale, the more rapidly a 3D sound's volume will
      attenuate as the distance between the listener and the sound increases.

      By default the roll off scale is set to 1, which simulates the real world.

      ```
      local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
      SoundService.RolloffScale = 1 -- attenuation simulates real world
      SoundService.RolloffScale = 2 -- sound attenuates twice as fast as the real world
      ```

      The listener can be changed using `Class.SoundService:SetListener()`.

      ```lua

      SoundService:SetListener(Enum.ListenerType.CFrame, CFrame.new(0, 0, 0))
      local listenerType, listener = SoundService:GetListener()
      print(listenerType, listener)
      ```

      #### What is a listener?

      The listener determines the point from which audio in the game is being
      'heard' by the player. For 3D `Class.Sound|Sounds` (Sounds parented to a
      BasePart or `Class.Attachment`) the listener influences the volume and
      left/right balance of a playing sound. Listeners have no influence on the
      playback of 2D sounds as they have no position of emission.

      By default, the listener is set to the CurrentCamera. However, a range of
      different types of listeners can be used.
