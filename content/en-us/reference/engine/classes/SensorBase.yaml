  An abstract class for various sensor instance types.

  A `Class.SensorBase` is an instance that, when parented to a `Class.BasePart`,
  outputs additional data about the world around that part. This data is
  presented in the sensor's "output" property category. Often, other systems
  will consume the sensor's output data.

      Determines how the sensor will update its output data.

      With `Enum.SensorUpdateType.OnRead`, internal sensor logic is run so that
      the output properties are always up to date. In this mode, the sensor will
      only run if you read the properties and they are currently outdated.

      With `Enum.SensorUpdateType.Manual`, the output properties will never
      change. Instead, you can write your own scripts to set the output
      properties as you like.
