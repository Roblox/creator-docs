  Imparts a whooshing or sweeping sound on audio streams.
description: |
  `Class.AudioFlanger` imparts a whooshing or sweeping sound on audio streams by
  overlaying a delayed copy of the input stream and modulating the pitch of the
  copy. It provides one **Input** pin and one **Output** pin which can be
  connected to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`.

    description: |
      Controls how strong the pitch modulation of the flanger is. Ranges from 0
      to 1 which determines the maximum delay time of the modulated signal. A
      value of 1 corresponds to 10 milliseconds of maximum delay; beyond this,
      the modulated signal would begin to sound more like an echo than a flange.
