  Splits an audio stream into component channels so that each can be processed
  independently.
description: |
  `Class.AudioChannelSplitter` splits an audio stream into component channels so
  that each can be processed independently. It provides one **Input** pin, one
  combined **Output** pin, as well as the following secondary output pins, all
  of which can be connected to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`: **Left**, **Right**,
  **Center**, **SurroundLeft**, **SurroundRight**, **Sub**, **BackLeft**,
  **BackRight**, **TopLeft**, **TopRight**, **TopBackLeft**, and
  **TopBackRight**.

    summary: |
      Controls the input channel layout to be split from.
    description: |
      Controls the input channel layout to be split from. When changed, all
      audio streams prior to this channel splitter's input may need to be
      up-mixed (widened to at least as many channels as the input requires).

      The **Output** pin produces a copy of the stream wired to **Input** but,
      depending on the value of `Class.AudioChannelSplitter.Layout`:

      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Mono|Mono`, the **Center** pin produces an
        audio stream.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Stereo|Stereo`, the **Left** and **Right**
        pins produce audio streams.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Quad|Quad`, the **Left**, **Right**,
        **BackLeft**, and **BackRight** pins produce audio streams.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_5|Surround_5` is the same as `Quad`,
        plus **Center** produces an audio stream.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_5_1|Surround_5_1` is the same as
        `Surround_5`, plus **Sub** produces an audio stream.
      - `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_7_1|Surround_7_1` is the same as
        `Surround_5_1`, plus **SurroundLeft** and **SurroundRight** produce
        audio streams.
      - For `Enum.AudioChannelLayout.Surround_7_1_4|Surround_7_1_4`, all
        secondary output pins produce audio streams.
