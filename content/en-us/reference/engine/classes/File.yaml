  An asset loaded from a file on disk.
description: |
  An object that represents an Asset loaded from a file on a local disk.

  Files generate a temporary asset id in the form _"rbxtemp://####"_, which can
  be used in Studio without uploading the asset, but will be destroyed when the
  File is destroyed or when the Studio session ends. Temporary asset ids are not
  shared across [Team Create](../../../projects/collaboration.md).

  The default `Class.Instance.Name|Name` of a File instance will be the filename
  on disk, excluding path, including extension.
