memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An asset loaded from a file on disk.
description: |
  An object that represents an asset loaded from a file on a local disk. Files
  generate a temporary asset ID in the form `rbxtemp://` which can be used in
  Studio without uploading the asset, but will be destroyed when the
  `Class.File` is destroyed or when the Studio session ends. Temporary asset IDs
  are not shared across [collaborative](../../../projects/collaboration.md)
  sessions.

  The default `Class.Instance.Name|Name` of a `Class.File` instance will be the
  filename on disk, excluding the path but including the extension.
