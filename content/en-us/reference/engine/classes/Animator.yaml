  Responsible for the playback and replication of `Class.Animation|Animations`.
description: |
  The main class responsible for the playback and replication of
  `Class.Animation|Animations`. All replication of playing
  `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` is handled through the `Class.Animator`
  instance.

  [Using Animations](../../../animation/using.md) to learn how to create and add
  pre-built or custom animations to your game.

      Computes relative velocities between parts and apply them to

    description: |
      Given the current set of `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` playing,
      and their current times and play speeds, compute relative velocities
      between the parts and apply them to Motor6D.Part1 (the part which
      `Class.Animator` considers the "child" part). These relative velocity
      calculations and assignments happen in the order provided.

      This method doesn't apply velocities for a given joint if both of the
      joint's parts are currently part of the same assembly, for example, if
      they are still connected directly or indirectly by Motors or Welds.

      This method doesn't disable or remove the joints for you. You must disable
      or otherwise remove the rigid joints from the assembly before calling this
      method.

      The given `Motor6Ds` are not required to be descendants of the
      `Class.DataModel`. Removing the joints from the `Class.DataModel` before
      calling this method is supported.

      Loads an `Class.Animation` onto an `Class.Animator`, returning an

    description: |
      This function loads the given `Class.Animation` onto this
      `Class.Animator`, returning a playable `Class.AnimationTrack`. When called
      on an `Class.Animator` within models that the client has network ownership
      of, for example the local player's character or from
      `Class.BasePart:SetNetworkOwner()`, this function also loads the animation
      for the server as well.

      Note that the `Class.Animator` must be in the `Class.Workspace` before
      making a call to `LoadAnimation()` or else it will be unable to retrieve
      the `Class.AnimationClipProvider` service and throw an error.

      You should use this function directly instead of the similarly-named
      `Class.Humanoid:LoadAnimation()` and
      `Class.AnimationController:LoadAnimation()` functions. These are
      deprecated proxies of this function which also create an `Class.Animator`
      if one does not exist; this can cause replication issues if you are not
      careful.

      #### Loading an Animation on Client or Server

      In order for `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` to replicate
      correctly, it's important to know when they should be loaded on the client
      or on the server:

      - If an `Class.Animator` is a descendant of a `Class.Humanoid` or
        `Class.AnimationController` in a player's `Class.Player.Character`,
        animations started on that player's client will be replicated to the
        server and other clients.

      - If the `Class.Animator` is **not** a descendant of a player character,
        its animations must be loaded and started on the server to replicate.

      The `Class.Animator` object must be initially created on the server and
      replicated to clients for animation replication to work at all. If an
      `Class.Animator` is created locally, then
      `Class.AnimationTrack|AnimationTracks` loaded with that `Class.Animator`
      will not replicate.

      Increments the `Class.AnimationTrack.TimePosition` of all playing

      `Class.Animator`. For use in the command bar or by plugins only.

      `Class.Animator`. For use in the command bar or by plugins only.

      The deltaTime parameter determines the number of seconds to increment on
      the animation's progress. Typically this function will be called in a loop
      to preview the length of an animation (see example).

      Note that once animations have stopped playing, the model's joints will
      need to be manually reset to their original positions (see example).

      This function is used to simulate playback of `Class.Animation|Animations`
      when the game isn't running. This allows animations to be previewed
      without the consequences of running the game, such as scripts executing.
      If the function is called while the game is running, or by
      `Class.Script|Scripts` or `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, it will return
      an error.

      Developers designing their own custom animation editors are advised to use
      this function to preview animations, as it is the method the official
      Roblox Animation Editor plugin uses.
