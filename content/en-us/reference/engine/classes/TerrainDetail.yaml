name: TerrainDetail

memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Determines appearance of a certain terrain face direction.
description: |
  TerrainDetail has to be a child of a `Class.MaterialVariant` object. The
  `Class.MaterialVariant.BaseMaterial` property of the parent MaterialVariant
  object need to be one of the supported terrain Material, for example, it can
  be Basalt but not Plastic.

  Terrain renders with different textures for it's top(+y), bottom(-y), and
  side(horizontal to y axis) faces. If a MaterialVariant has no TerrainDetail
  children, all faces are rendered as MaterialVariant specified. At most 3
  TerrainDetail objects can be added to MaterialVariant, one for each face.
  TerrainDetail overrides the terrain appearance of a certain face.

  For example, it can achieve this kind of effect: the top surface of Grass has
  lots of grass. On side surfaces, there are less grass. On bottom surfaces
  there are no grass.

      This property determines the apparent emissivity across the surface. An
      emissive mask is a grayscale image where black pixels correspond to no
      emissivity, and white pixels correspond to full emissivity.

      The emissive contribution gets added to total lighting contribution across
      the surface, and the sum gets multiplied by the albedo texture, which
      would be sampled from `Class.TerrainDetail.ColorMap|ColorMap` if provided.

    description: |
      This value is a multiplier to control how strong the emissive contribution
      is across the surface. If the final contribution of emissives goes beyond
      supported dynamic range, it will get clamped; this could result in
      emissive contribution appearing all white when using large emissive
      strength values. Since this value is a multiplier, the maximum value to
      prevent clamping depends on all of the other contributing values,
      including `Class.TerrainDetail.EmissiveTint|EmissiveTint`,
      `Class.TerrainDetail.ColorMap|ColorMap` and combined lighting
      contribution.

    description: |
      This property determines which parts of the surface are metal and are
      non-metal. A metalness map is a grayscale image where black pixels
      correspond to non-metals and white pixels correspond to metals.

      Metals only reflect light the same color as the metal, and they reflect
      much more light than non-metals. Most materials in the real world can be
      categorized either metals or non-metals. For this reason, most pixels in a
      metalness map will be either pure black or pure white. Values in between
      are typically used to simulate dirt or grunge on top of an underlying
      metal area.

      When `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentSpecularScale` is 0, metalness has no
      effect. For the most realistic reflections, setting
      EnvironmentSpecularScale and `Class.Lighting.EnvironmentDiffuseScale` to
      1, and `Class.Lighting.Ambient` and `Class.Lighting.OutdoorAmbient` to
      (0,0,0) is recommended.

    description: |
      This property modifies the lighting of the surface by adding bumps, dents,
      cracks, and curves without adding more polygons.

      Normal maps are RGB images that modify the surface's normal vector used
      for lighting calculations. The R, G, and B channels of the NormalMap
      correspond to the X, Y, and Z components of the local surface vector
      respectively, and byte values of 0 and 255 for each channel correspond
      linearly to normal vector components of -1 and 1.016 respectively. This
      range is stretched slightly from -1 to 1 so that a byte value of 127 maps
      to exactly 0. The normal vector's Z axis is always defined as the
      direction of the underlying mesh's normal. A uniform (127,127,255) image
      translates to a completely flat normal map where the normal is everywhere
      perpendicular to the mesh surface. This format is called "tangent space"
      normal maps. Roblox does not support world space or object space normal
      maps.

      Incorrectly flipped normal components can make bumps appear like indents.
      If you import a normal map and notice the lighting looks off, you may need
      to invert the G channel of the image. The X and Y axes of the tangent
      space frame correspond to the X and Y directions in the image after it's
      transformed by the mesh UVs. If you view your normal map in an image
      editor as if it were displayed on a surface, normals pointing towards the
      right side of the screen should appear more red, and normals pointing
      towards the top side of your screen should appear more green.

      The terms "DirectX format" and "OpenGL format" are sometimes used to
      describe whether the G channel of the normal map is inverted or not.
      Roblox expects the OpenGL format.

      Roblox expects imported meshes to include tangents. Modeling software may
      also refer to this as "tangent space" information. If you apply a normal
      map and it does not seem to make any visual difference, you may need to
      re-export your mesh along with its tangent information from modeling
      software.
