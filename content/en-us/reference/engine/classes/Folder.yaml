  A simple container used to hold and organize Roblox instances. Unlike other
  container classes like `Class.Model`, a folder generally offers no additional
  functionality. Folders behave the same way as folders in a computer file
  system, meaning they can also be parented to each other.

  #### Usage in UI Hierarchies

  Each `Class.Folder` in your UI hierarchy can define its own `Class.UILayout`
  (`Class.UIListLayout`, `Class.UIGridLayout`, `Class.UIPageLayout`,
  `Class.UITableLayout`), or use a default position-based layout. For example,
  you can set up a `Class.Frame` with multiple `Class.Folder` children, each
  with a different `Class.UILayout` type. Additionally, `Class.Folder` contents
  are exempt from the effects of a `Class.UILayout` sibling.
