description: |
  A simple container used to hold and organize Roblox instances. Unlike other
  container classes like `Class.Model`, a folder offers no additional
  functionality. Folders behave the same way as folders in a computer file
  system, meaning they can also be parented to each other.

  # Usage in UI Hierarchies
  Each `Class.Folder` in your UI hierarchy can define its own `Class.UILayout`
  (List, Grid, Page, Table) or use the default Position-based layout. For example,
  you could have a `Class.GuiObject` with multiple `Class.Folder` children, each with
  a different `Class.UILayout` type.
  Additionally, `Class.Folder` contents are exempted from the effects of a `Class.UILayout` sibling.
