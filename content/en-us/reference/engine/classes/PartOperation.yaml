    summary: |
      The level of detail used to render the solid modeled part.
    description: |
      This property determines the level of detail that the solid modeled part
      will be shown in. It can be set to the possible values of the
      `Enum.RenderFidelity` enum.

      By default, solid modeled parts will always be shown in **precise
      fidelity**, no matter how far they are from the camera. This improves
      their appearance when viewed from any distance, but if a place has a large
      number of detailed solid modeled parts, it may reduce overall performance.

  - name: PartOperation.SmoothingAngle
    summary: |
      An angle in degrees which affects the smooth shading of a solid modeled
      part.
    description: |
      This property represents an angle in degrees for a threshold value between
      face normals on a [solid modeled](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) part.
      If the normal difference is less than the value, normals will be adjusted
      to smooth the difference. While a value between 30 and 70 degrees usually
      produces a good result, values between 90 and 180 are not recommended as
      they may cause a "shadowing" effect on unions with sharp edges.

      Note that smoothing does not affect the normals between different
      materials or different colors.

      union will maintain their original colors from before the onion operation
      was performed.

      Substitutes the geometry of this `Class.PartOperation` with the geometry

    description: |
      Substitutes the geometry of this `Class.PartOperation` with the geometry
      of another `Class.PartOperation`. This makes it easier to utilize the
      geometry of a solid modeling operation like
      `Class.GeometryService:UnionAsync()|UnionAsync()`,
      `Class.GeometryService:SubtractAsync()|SubtractAsync()`, or
      `Class.GeometryService:IntersectAsync()|IntersectAsync()` but maintain
      properties, attributes, tags, and children of the main part such as
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
      `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, light objects, decals, and more.
      This approach also circumvents the potential "flicker" of completely
      replacing the original `Class.PartOperation` with another.

      Note that if you're calling this method on a `Class.PartOperation` with
      child `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
      you should calculate the affected instances with
      `Class.GeometryService:CalculateConstraintsToPreserve()|CalculateConstraintsToPreserve()`,
      then drop those whose recommended parent is `nil`.
