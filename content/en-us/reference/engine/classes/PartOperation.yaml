    summary: |
      The level of detail used to render the solid modeled part.
    description: |
      This property determines the level of detail that the solid modeled part
      will be shown in. It can be set to the possible values of the
      `Enum.RenderFidelity` enum.

      By default, solid modeled parts will always be shown in **precise
      fidelity**, no matter how far they are from the camera. This improves
      their appearance when viewed from any distance, but if a place has a large
      number of detailed solid modeled parts, it may reduce overall performance.

  - name: PartOperation.SmoothingAngle
    summary: |
      An angle in degrees which affects the smooth shading of a solid modeled
      part.
    description: |
      This property represents an angle in degrees for a threshold value between
      face normals on a [solid modeled](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) part.
      If the normal difference is less than the value, normals will be adjusted
      to smooth the difference. While a value between 30 and 70 degrees usually
      produces a good result, values between 90 and 180 are not recommended as
      they may cause a "shadowing" effect on unions with sharp edges.

      Note that smoothing does not affect the normals between different
      materials or different colors.

      Sets whether the `Class.PartOperation` can be recolored using the

      union will maintain their original colors from before the onion operation
      was performed.

      Substitutes the geometry of this `Class.PartOperation` with the geometry

    description: |
      Substitutes the geometry of this `Class.PartOperation` with the geometry
      of another `Class.PartOperation`. This makes it easier to utilize the
      geometry of a solid modeling operation like
      `Class.GeometryService:UnionAsync()|UnionAsync()`,
      `Class.GeometryService:SubtractAsync()|SubtractAsync()`, or
      `Class.GeometryService:IntersectAsync()|IntersectAsync()` but maintain
      properties, attributes, tags, and children of the main part such as
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments`, `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
      `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, light objects, decals, and more.
      This approach also circumvents the potential "flicker" of completely
      replacing the original `Class.PartOperation` with another.

      Note that if you're calling this method on a `Class.PartOperation` with
      child `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or `Class.Constraint|Constraints`,
      you should calculate the affected instances with
      `Class.GeometryService:CalculateConstraintsToPreserve()|CalculateConstraintsToPreserve()`,
      then drop those whose recommended parent is `nil`.
