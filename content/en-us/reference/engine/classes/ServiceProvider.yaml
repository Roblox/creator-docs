  - name: ServiceProvider:GetService
    summary: |
      Returns the service with the requested class name, creating it if it does
      not exist.
    description: |
      Returns a service with the class name requested. When called with the name
      of a service (such as `Class.Debris`) it will return the instance of that
      service. If the service does not yet exist it will be created and the new
      service is returned. This is the only way to create some services, and can
      also be used for services that have unusual names, e.g. RunService's name
      is "Run Service".

      Note:

      - This function will return `nil` if the className parameter is an
        existing class, but the class is not a service.
      - If you attempt to fetch a service that is present under another Object,
        an error will be thrown stating that the "singleton serviceName already
        exists".

    returns:
      - type: Instance
        summary: |
          An instance of the requested service.
