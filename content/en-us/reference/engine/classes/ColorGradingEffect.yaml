  A class allowing to customize the Color Grading used by the renderer
description: | 
  The **ColorGradingEffect** instance is a **PostEffect** expected to live under the **Lighting** instance. It allows the customization of Color Grading techniques used in an experience. Color grading defines how color values should be converted to a screen's color range through the tone mapper, which allows to create different moods and visual styles. 

  If there exists multiple **ColorGradingEffect** instances under the Lighting instance, only the instance that was most recently parented under Lighting and that is enabled will be applied. The other enabled **ColorGradingEffect** instances will be ignored. Any **ColorGradingEffect** not parented to the **Lighting** instance are ignored. 

  The main ColorGradingEffect property is:

  - `Class.ColorGradingEffect.ToneMapperPreset` which allows to select which tone mapper to use for the place.
