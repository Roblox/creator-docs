  The **ColorGradingEffect** effect modifies how color values calculated by the
  renderer should be converted to the screen's color range, impacting the mood
  and appearance of your place.

  **ColorGradingEffect** is expected to be parented to `Class.Lighting` and will
  be ignored if parented elsewhere. Multiple instances cannot be combined and
  only the most recently parented instance to `Class.Lighting` will be applied.

  For more details on this effect and others, see
  [Post-Processing Effects](../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md).
