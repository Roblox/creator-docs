description: |
  A `Class.LocalScript` is a Lua code container that runs its contents on the
  client (player's device) instead of the server. It is used to access
  client-only objects such as the player's `Class.Camera`.

  For code run through `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, the
  `Class.Players.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` property of the `Class.Players`
  service will return the player whose client is running the script.

  See [here](../../../projects/data-model.md#client) for a table of valid
  container services from which `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` will execute.
