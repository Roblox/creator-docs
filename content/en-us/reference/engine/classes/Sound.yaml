name: Sound
type: class
memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  An object that emits sound. This object can be placed within a
  `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` to emit a sound from a particular
  position within a place or world, or it can be attached elsewhere to play the
  sound at a constant volume throughout the entire place.
description: |
  `Class.Sound` is an object that emits sound. When placed in a `Class.BasePart`
  or an `Class.Attachment`, this object will emit its sound from that part's
  `Class.BasePart.Position` or the attachment's
  `Class.Attachment.WorldPosition`. In this placement, a `Class.Sound` exhibits
  the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch varies with the relative
  motion of whatever attachment or part it is attached to. Additionally, its
  volume will be determined by the distance between the client's sound listener
  (by default the `Class.Camera` position) and the position of the sound's
  parent. For more information, see `Class.Sound.RollOffMode|RollOffMode`.

  A sound is considered "global" if it is **not** parented to a `Class.BasePart`
  or an `Class.Attachment`. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume
  throughout the entire place.

    summary: |
      The minimum distance, in studs, at which a 3D `Class.Sound` (direct child

      of a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`) will begin to attenuate
      (decrease in volume).

      Sounds parented to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` that are
      descendants of the `Class.Workspace` are considered 3D sounds and their
      volume while playing is dependent on the distance between the client's
      sound listener (`Class.Camera` position by default) and the Sound's
      parent. Two properties influence this behavior EmitterSize and
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMode`.

      The way the `Class.Sound` attenuates (fades out) after the distance
      between the listener and the sound exceeds the EmitterSize is determined
      by RollOffMode.

      The maximum distance, in studs, a client's listener can be from the

      The maximum distance, in studs, a client's listener can be from the
      `Class.Sound` origin and still hear it. Only applies to Sounds parented to
      a `Class.Part` or `Class.Attachment` (3D sounds).

      How MaxDistance impacts the attenuation of a sound (manner in which it
      fades out) is dependent on the `Class.Sound.RollOffMode` property. When
      RollOffMode is set to use an inverse type distance model (Inverse or
      InverseTapered) the MaxDistance will not effect the attenuation of the
      sound. This means that low values for MaxDistance will cause the sound to
      abruptly cut off when the listener reaches the MaxDistance. In most cases
      this is not desirable and developers are advised not to use low
      MaxDistance values.

      When RollOffMode is set to a linear type distance model (Linear or
      LinearSquared) the sound will attenuate between `Class.Sound.EmitterSize`
      and MaxDistance (with playback volume reaching zero at MaxDistance). This
      is less realistic, but in some cases allows attenuation to be handled in a
      more intuitive way.

    description: |
      This property reflects the progress of the `Class.Sound` in seconds. It
      can be changed to move the playback position of the sound both before and
      during playback.

      As a `Class.Sound` is played, `Class.Sound.TimePosition|TimePosition`
      increases at a rate of `Class.Sound.PlaybackSpeed|PlaybackSpeed` per
      second. Once `Class.Sound.TimePosition|TimePosition` reaches
      `Class.Sound.TimeLength|TimeLength`, the sound will stop unless it is
      `Class.Sound.Looped|Looped`.

      Note that setting `Class.Sound.TimePosition|TimePosition` to a value
      greater than the length in a looped track will not cause it to wrap
      around. If that behavior is desired, consider the following code snippet:

      ```
      local newPosition = 1.5

      if newPosition >= sound.TimeLength then
      	newPosition = newPosition - sound.TimeLength
      end
      sound.TimePosition = newPosition
      ```

      When the `Class.Sound` is stopped through `Class.Sound:Stop()|Stop()`, the

      Note that this event will **not** fire for sounds with

      reaching their end. This event will also **not** fire when the sound is
