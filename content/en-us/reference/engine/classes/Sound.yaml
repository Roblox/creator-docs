  A `Class.Sound` is an object that emits sound. Sounds can be placed within a
  `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` to emit a sound from a particular
  position within a place or world, or it can be attached elsewhere to play the
  sound at a constant volume throughout the entire place.

  A `Class.Sound` is an object that emits sound.

  ## 2D and 3D Sound

  A sound placed in a `Class.BasePart` or an `Class.Attachment` will emit its
  sound from that part's `Class.BasePart.Position` or the attachment's
  `Class.Attachment.WorldPosition`. A sound exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning
  its frequency and pitch varies with the relative motion of whatever attachment
  or part it is attached to. The volume of the sound will be determined by the
  distance between the client's sound listener (by default the `Class.Camera`
  position) and the position of the sound's parent. For more information on this
  see `Class.Sound.RollOffMode`.

  A sound is considered "global" if it is not parented to a `Class.BasePart` or
  an `Class.Attachment`. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume
  throughout the entire place.

      The minimum distance, in studs, at which a 3D `Class.Sound` (direct child

      of a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment`) will begin to attenuate
      (decrease in volume).

      Sounds parented to a `Class.BasePart` or `Class.Attachment` that are
      descendants of the `Class.Workspace` are considered 3D sounds and their
      volume while playing is dependent on the distance between the client's
      sound listener (`Class.Camera` position by default) and the Sound's
      parent. Two properties influence this behavior EmitterSize and
      `Class.Sound.RollOffMode`.

      The way the `Class.Sound` attenuates (fades out) after the distance
      between the listener and the sound exceeds the EmitterSize is determined
      by RollOffMode.

      This property will be true when the `Class.Sound` has loaded from Roblox

      In Roblox, audio files are not stored in games themselves but hosted on
      the Roblox servers and referenced by the `Class.Sound.SoundId` property.
      This means that they need to be downloaded to a client's device before
      they can be played. This can take a while depending on the user's internet
      connection, the length of the sound and the number of other objects that
      need to be loaded.

      Developers can use the `Class.Sound.IsLoaded` property and the
      `Class.Sound.Loaded` event if they wish to verify a sound has loaded
      before playing it.

      parented to a `Class.Part` or `Class.Attachment` (3D sounds).

      How MaxDistance impacts the attenuation of a sound (manner in which it
      fades out) is dependent on the `Class.Sound.RollOffMode` property. When
      RollOffMode is set to use an inverse type distance model (Inverse or
      InverseTapered) the MaxDistance will not effect the attenuation of the
      sound. This means that low values for MaxDistance will cause the sound to
      abruptly cut off when the listener reaches the MaxDistance. In most cases
      this is not desirable and developers are advised not to use low
      MaxDistance values.

      When RollOffMode is set to a linear type distance model (Linear or
      LinearSquared) the sound will attenuate between `Class.Sound.EmitterSize`
      and MaxDistance (with playback volume reaching zero at MaxDistance). This

      In the studio editor, `Class.Sound|Sounds` are not playable because time

      This property should not be confused with `Class.Sound.IsPlaying` which is

      the playback of a sound.

      Note that when Playing is set to false, the `Class.Sound.TimePosition`

      #### Inverse vs Linear Distance Attenuation

      By default sounds are set to use inverse distance attenuation
      (Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse) which mirrors how sounds attenuate in the real
      world. Under inverse distance attenuation, sounds will begin to attenuate
      once the distance between the listener and the Sound's parent exceeds
      RollOffMinDistance. The rate of attenuation depends on the emitter size,
      as sounds with larger EmitterSize's will attenuate at a slower rate.
      Inverse rate of inverse distance attenuation is further influenced by
      `Class.SoundService.RolloffScale`.

      RollOffMaxDistance will not effect attenuation under the inverse model but
      will cause the sound to cut off completely once this distance is reached.
      This can be particularly abrupt when using low values for max distance.

      Linear distance attenuation works differently. Under linear distance
      attenuation the sound will attenuate between RollOffMinDistance and
      RollOffMaxDistance, falling silent once MaxDistance is reached.
      RollOffMinDistance still denotes the point at which the sound will begin
      attenuating. However, the audible volume at any point now depends on the
      point the listener is at between EmitterSize and MaxDistance. This means,
      in contrast to the inverse distance attenuation model, the audible volume
      of the sound will approach silence at MaxDistance point. This is less
      realistic, but may be more desirable in some cases.

      however if it is being set from a `Class.Script` then the correct content
      ID will need to be used, using the number from the URL. For example:

      ```lua

      Shows the progress in seconds of the `Class.Sound`. Can be changed to move
      the playback position of the sound. If the sound is already playing then
      playback will snap to the specified position. If it is not playing the
      `Class.Sound` will begin playback at the set position when the sound is
      next played.

      As a `Class.Sound` is played, TimePosition increases at a rate of
      `Class.Sound.PlaybackSpeed` per second. Once TimePosition reaches
      `Class.Sound.TimeLength` the Sound will stop unless it is looped. This
      means, unless `Class.Sound.Looped` is set to true setting TimePosition to
      a value equal or greater to `Class.Sound.TimeLength` will stop the sound.

      Note that setting `TimePosition` to a value greater than the length in a
      looped track will not cause it to wrap around. If that behavior is desired
      the developer should do the following.

          if newPosition >= sound.TimeLength then
          	newPosition = newPosition - sound.TimeLength
          end
          sound.TimePosition = newPosition

      Setting TimePosition to a value less than zero currently does not
      influence playback, but this behavior should not be relied upon.

      Fires whenever the `Class.Sound` is paused using `Class.Sound:Pause()`.

      As with `Class.Sound.Played`, `Class.Sound.Resumed` and
      `Class.Sound.Stopped` only the respective sound function will cause the
      event to fire. This means that Pause will only fire when
      `Class.Sound:Pause()` is called.

      Fires whenever the `Class.Sound` is played using the `Class.Sound:Play()`
      function.

      As with `Class.Sound.Stopped`, `Class.Sound.Paused` and
      `Class.Sound.Resumed` only the respective sound function will cause the
      event to fire. This means that Played will only fire when
      `Class.Sound:Play()` is called. This event will not fire if the
      `Class.Sound` is played due to the sound being destroyed and
      `Class.Sound.PlayOnRemove` being set to true.

      Fires when the `Class.Sound` is stopped due to the `Class.Sound:Stop()`
      function.

      As with `Class.Sound.Played`, `Class.Sound.Paused` and

      event to fire. This means that Stopped will only fire when
      `Class.Sound:Stop()` is called. Destroying a sound while it is playing
      will not cause this event to fire.
