  Ensures two axes on two bodies remain perpendicular.
description: |
  A **UniversalConstraint** ensures two axes on two bodies remain perpendicular.
  Contextually, this constraint is more restrictive than a
  `Class.BallSocketConstraint` but less restrictive than a
  `Class.HingeConstraint` by one degree of freedom.

  Example applications of this constraint include transmitting power between the
  transmission and drive shafts of cars, robotics, and more.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Limits

  Enabling the `Class.UniversalConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property
  exposes the `Class.UniversalConstraint.MaxAngle|MaxAngle` limit to restrict
  tilt within a cone, as well as
  `Class.UniversalConstraint.Restitution|Restitution` which defines the
  elasticity of the attachments when they reach the limit.

      Determines whether the angular motion of attachments' primary axes is
      limited.
    description: |
      This property, when enabled, limits the relative angular motion of the
      primary axes of attachments through a cone constraint. The default value
      is false.

    summary: |
      The max angle, in degrees, of the constraint's limiting cone.
    description: |
      This property determines the max angle, in degrees, of the constraint's
      limiting cone, formed from `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0` and
      its primary axis. The default value is 45 degrees.

      In order for this property to take affect, the constraint's
      `Class.UniversalConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property must be
      set to true.

    summary: |
      The restitution coefficient of the cone constraint.
    description: |
      This property determines the restitution of the two
      `Class.Attachment|Attachments` connected by the
      `Class.UniversalConstraint` when they reach the end of the range specified
      by `Class.UniversalConstraint.MaxAngle|MaxAngle`. The value defaults to 0
      and can be any floating number in the range of 0 to 1. Only applies when
      `Class.UniversalConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` is set to true.
