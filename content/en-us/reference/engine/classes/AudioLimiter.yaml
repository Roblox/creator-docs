description: |
  `AudioLimiter` limits how loud audio streams are allowed to be. Whenever its
  input stream exceeds a specified maximum level, the stream's volume is reduced
  for a moment. `AudioLimiter` provides a single **Input** pin, and a single
  **Output** pin that can be connected to/from by `Class.Wires`.

      The maximum volume, in decibels, that the limiter will allow to pass
      through without reduction. Whenever the input stream exceeds
      `Class.AudioLimiter.MaxLevel|MaxLevel`, the output stream's volume will be
      reduced to compensate. This value ranges from `-12` to `0`.
