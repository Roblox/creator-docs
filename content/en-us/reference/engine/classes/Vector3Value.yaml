summary: |
  A container object for a single Vector3 value.
description: |
  A Vector3Value simply holds a Vector3 as a value. This value can be used for
  scripts to communicate, for objects to move to a preset location, etc.

events:

    summary: |
      Fired whenever `Class.Vector3Value.Value` is changed.
    description: |
      Fired whenever the `Class.Vector3Value.Value` of the `Class.Vector3Value`
      is changed. It will run with the new value being stored in the argument
      object, instead of a string representing the property being changed.

      This event, like other changed events, can be used to track when an
      Vector3Value changes and to track the different values that it may change
      to.

      For instance, this may be useful in games that rely on Vector3Values to
      track positions in the game world.

      Equivalent changed events exist for similar objects, such as
      `Class.NumberValue` and `Class.StringValue`, depending on what object type
      best suits the need.
