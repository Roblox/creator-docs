name: UIGridLayout
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Positions sibling UI elements by filling rows using the space of the parent UI
  element.
description: |
  A UIGridLayout (not to be confused with the abstract `Class.UIGridStyleLayout`
  from which this class inherits) lays out sibling UI elements in multiple rows
  within the parent UI element, adding elements to a row one-by-one until the
  next element would not fit. It then continues adding elements in the next row.
  A UIGridLayout will take UI elements' `Class.GuiObject.Size` and
  `Class.GuiObject.Position` under control. While under control, these UI
  elements' properties will not be editable in the Properties window.

  By default, it lays out elements in **ascending** order where lower values
  take more priority over higher values, but this can be changed to use
  elements' names by changing `Class.UIListLayout.SortOrder` to **Name**. A
  UIListLayout will automatically re-layout elements when elements are
  added/removed, or if a relevant property changes:
  `Class.GuiObject.LayoutOrder` or `Class.Instance.Name`. This can be triggered
  manually by calling `Class.UIGridStyleLayout:ApplyLayout()`, though this is
  typically not necessary.

  The actual cell sizes are the same for all cells. A UIGridLayout will respect
  UI constraints placed with it, such as `Class.UISizeConstraint` and
  `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`. Elements in the layout can span multiple
  cells if they have a `Class.UISizeConstraint` with a
  `Class.UISizeConstraint.MinSize|MinSize` set higher than the
  `Class.UIGridLayout.CellSize|CellSize`. It is possible to limit the number of
  elements per row using `Class.UIGridLayout.FillDirectionMaxCells`. If set to
  1, it is possible to create a single row of elements (as each element would be
  positioned in its own row).

  This layout is appropriate when line breaks are OK after arbitrary cells. For
  example, a set of inventory spaces is a good use of this layout. If building a
  table of values in which a line break is not appropriate in the middle of
  tabular data, it might be a better idea to use a `Class.UITableLayout`
  instead.

      FillDirectionMaxCells determines the number of cells in the grid that can
      be used before continuing on the next row/column (whether this is a row or
      column is dependent on `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection`). This
      value must be non-negative.

      - If set to zero, there is no maximum number of cells that may appear in
        one row/column except for how many can fit within the parent UI element.
      - If set to one, this creates a list similar to those created by
        `Class.UIListLayout`.

      StartCorner (`Enum.StartCorner`) determines from which corner the grid
      starts laying out UI elements. The grid continues in the
      `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection`, filling elements one by one until
      `Class.UIGridLayout.FIllDirectionMaxCells` cells have been laid out in
      that row/column or if all the parent UI element's space has been occupied
      by previous cells.

      Above, the potion is the first `Class.ImageLabel`, followed by the gem and
      the sword. The UIGridLayout is using a `Enum.StartCorner` of BottomRight.
      The `Class.UIGridStyleLayout.FillDirection` is Horizontal.
