  Produces audio streams from physical devices, such as microphones.
description: |
  `Class.AudioDeviceInput` produces audio streams from physical devices, such as
  microphones. It provides a single **Output** pin which can be connected to
  other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. `Class.AudioDeviceInput` has properties for
  selecting which `Class.Player` is producing the stream, and controlling
  whether or not they are muted.

      Determines whether the list of user IDs provided to
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.SetUserIdAccessList|SetUserIdAccessList` is
      treated as an allow-list or deny-list.

      If `Class.AudioDeviceInput.AccessType|AccessType` is
      `Enum.AccessModifierType.Allow`, then **only** the supplied user IDs are
      **permitted** to hear this `Class.AudioDeviceInput`. If
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.AccessType|AccessType` is
      `Enum.AccessModifierType.Deny`, then **only** the supplied user IDs are
      **blocked** from hearing this `Class.AudioDeviceInput`.

      Since player voices are networked, this property should only be assigned
      from the server in order to replicate properly.

      Controls whether this `Class.AudioDeviceInput` is muted. Unlike

      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Active|Active` is true **and**
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Muted|Muted` is false.
