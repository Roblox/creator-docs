summary: |
  Produces audio streams from physical devices, such as microphones.
description: |
  `Class.AudioDeviceInput` produces audio streams from physical devices, such as
  microphones. It provides a single **Output** pin which can be connected to
  other pins via `Class.Wire|Wires`. `Class.AudioDeviceInput` has properties for
  selecting which `Class.Player` is producing the stream, and controlling
  whether or not they are muted.

      Determines whether the list of user IDs provided to
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.SetUserIdAccessList|SetUserIdAccessList` is
      treated as an allow-list or deny-list.

      If `Class.AudioDeviceInput.AccessType|AccessType` is
      `Enum.AccessModifierType.Allow`, then **only** the supplied user IDs are
      **permitted** to hear this `Class.AudioDeviceInput`. If
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.AccessType|AccessType` is
      `Enum.AccessModifierType.Deny`, then **only** the supplied user IDs are
      **blocked** from hearing this `Class.AudioDeviceInput`.

      Since player voices are networked, this property should only be assigned
      from the server in order to replicate properly.

      Controls whether the physical device is actively recording. This property
      is only set by Roblox core scripts, but it may be read by user scripts.

      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Active|Active` is true **and**
      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Muted|Muted` is false.

      `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Muted|Muted` is false.
