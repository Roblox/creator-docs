  Attachment0's primary axis.
description: |
  Constrains Attachment0 and Attachment1 such that both points lie in a plane
  defined by Attachment0. The plane origin is at Attachment0 and the plane unit
  normal is the primary axis of Attachment0. This means that Attachment0 and
  Attachment1 will move to a position/orientation such that the distance between
  Attachment1 and Attachment0, projected onto the Plane unit normal, is zero.
