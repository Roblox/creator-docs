  Attachment0's primary axis.
description: |
  Constrains Attachment0 and Attachment1 such that both points lie in an plane
  defined by Attachment0. The plane origin is at Attachment0 and the plane unit
  normal is the primary axis of Attachment0. This means that Attachment0 and
  Attachment1 will move to a position/orientation such that the distance between
  Attachment1 and Attachment0, projected onto the Plane unit normal, is zero.
