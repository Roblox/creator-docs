  A class which defines a view of the 3D world.
description: |
  The **Camera** object defines a view of the 3D world. In a running experience,
  each client has its own **Camera** object which resides in that client's local
  `Class.Workspace`, accessible through the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`
  property.

  The most important camera properties are:

  - `Class.Camera.CFrame` which represents the position and orientation of the
    camera.

  - `Class.Camera.CameraType` which is read by the experience's camera scripts
    and determines how the camera should update each frame.

  - `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` which is read by the experience's camera
    scripts and determines what object the camera should follow.

  - `Class.Camera.FieldOfView` which represents the visible extent of the
    observable world.

  - `Class.Camera.Focus` which represents the point the camera is looking at.
    It's important this property is set, as certain visuals will be more
    detailed and will update more frequently depending on how close they are to
    the focus point.

  See [Customizing the Camera](../../../workspace/camera.md) for more
  information on how to adjust and customize the camera's behavior.

      The `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`, defining its position and
      orientation in the 3D world.
    description: |
      This property is the `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`, defining its
      position and orientation in the 3D world. Note that some transformations,
      such as the rotation of the head when using VR devices, are not reflected
      in this property, so you should use
      `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()|GetRenderCFrame()` to obtain the "true"
      `Datatype.CFrame` of the camera.

      You can move the camera by setting this property. However, the default
      camera scripts also set it, so you should either:

      - Set the camera `Class.Camera.CameraType` to `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable`
        so that the default camera scripts will not update the camera's
        `Datatype.CFrame`. This method is simplest and recommended in most
        cases.

      - Completely replace the default camera scripts with alternatives. This
        approach is only recommended if you do not need any default camera
        functionality.

      The most intuitive way to position and orient the `Class.Camera` is by
      using the `Datatype.CFrame.lookAt()` constructor. In the following
      example, the `Class.Camera` is positioned at
      `Datatype.Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)` and is oriented to be looking towards
      `Datatype.Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)`.

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

      local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local lookAtPos = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)

      workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos, lookAtPos)
      ```

      Although the camera can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you
      may want to animate it to move smoothly from one `Datatype.CFrame` to
      another. For this, you can either:

      - Set the camera's position/orientation every frame with
        `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` and the `Datatype.CFrame:Lerp()`
        method.
      - Create and play a `Class.Tween` that animates the position/orientation
        of the camera:

        ```lua
        local Players = game:GetService("Players")
        local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")

        local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
        camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

        local player = Players.LocalPlayer
        local character = player.Character
        if not character or character.Parent == nil then
        	character = player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
        end

        local pos = camera.CFrame * Vector3.new(0, 20, 0)
        local lookAtPos = character.PrimaryPart.Position
        local targetCFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos, lookAtPos)

        local tween = TweenService:Create(camera, TweenInfo.new(2), {CFrame = targetCFrame})

        tween:Play()
        ```

      **CameraSubject** accepts a variety of `Class.Instance|Instances`. The
      default camera scripts respond differently to the available settings:

      - By default, the camera scripts follow the local character's
        `Class.Humanoid`, factoring in the humanoid's current state and
        `Class.Humanoid.CameraOffset`.

      - When set to a `Class.BasePart`, the camera scripts follow its position,
        with a vertical offset in the case of `Class.VehicleSeat|VehicleSeats`.

      **CameraSubject** cannot be set to `nil`. Attempting to do so will revert
      it to its previous value.

      To restore **CameraSubject** to its default value, set it to the local
      character's `Class.Humanoid`:

      The **FieldOfView** property sets how many degrees in the vertical
      direction the camera can view. This property is clamped between 1 and 120
      degrees and defaults at 70. Very low or very high fields of view are not
      recommended as they can be disorientating to players.

      Note that uniform scaling is enforced, meaning the vertical and horizontal
      field of view are always related by the aspect ratio of the screen.

      Suggested uses for **FieldOfView** (FOV) include:

      - Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification, for example when
        using binoculars.
      - Increasing FOV when the player is "sprinting" to give the impression of
        a lack of control.

      For example, when this property is set to `Enum.FieldOfViewMode.Vertical`,
      the horizontal FOV is updated when the viewport is resized, but the
      vertical FOV is kept constant. If this property is set to
      `Enum.FieldOfViewMode.Diagonal`, both horizontal and vertical FOV might be
      changed to keep the diagonal FOV constant.

    summary: |
      Sets the area in 3D space that is prioritized by Roblox's graphical
      systems.
    description: |
      Certain graphical operations the engine performs, such as updating
      lighting, can take time or computational effort to complete. The camera's
      **Focus** property tells the engine which area in 3D space to prioritize
      when performing such operations. For example, dynamic lighting from
      objects such as `Class.PointLight|PointLights` may not render at distances
      far from the focus.

      The default Roblox camera scripts automatically set **Focus** to follow
      the `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` (usually a `Class.Humanoid`). However,
      **Focus** will **not** automatically update when
      `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` is set to
      `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable` or when the default camera scripts are not
      being used. In these cases, you should update **Focus** every frame, using
      `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` function at the
      `Enum.RenderPriority.Camera` priority.

      **Focus** has no bearing on the position or orientation of the camera; see
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` for this.

    description: |
      Toggles whether the camera will automatically track the head motion of a
      player using a VR device. When `true` (default), the engine combines
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` with the `Enum.UserCFrame` of the user's head to
      render the player's view with head tracking factored in. The view will be
      rendered at the following `Datatype.CFrame`:

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

      local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
      headCFrame = headCFrame.Rotation + headCFrame.Position * camera.HeadScale

      -- This will be equivalent to Camera:GetRenderCFrame()
      local renderCFrame = camera.CFrame * headCFrame
      ```

      It is recommended to **not** disable this property for the following
      reasons:

      - Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking
        solution is not added.
      - The Roblox engine performs latency optimizations when **HeadLocked** is
        true.

      #### See Also

        `Datatype.CFrame` of the head.
      - `Class.VRService:RecenterUserHeadCFrame()` which is used to recenter the
        head to the current position and orientation of the VR device.

      Sets the scale of the user's perspective of the world when using VR.
    description: |
      **HeadScale** is the scale of the user's perspective of the world when
      using VR.

      The size of 1 stud in VR is `0.3 meters / HeadScale`, meaning that larger
      **HeadScale** values equate to the world looking smaller from the user's
      perspective when using VR devices. For example, a part that's 1 stud tall
      appears to be 0.6 meters tall to a VR player with a **HeadScale** of 0.5.

      This property is automatically controlled by
      `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` to align the player's perspective with
      the size of their avatar. If you intend to control **HeadScale** yourself
      or use custom characters, toggle `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` to
      `Enum.VRScaling.Off`.

      This property should not be confused with `Class.Humanoid.HeadScale` which
      is a `Class.NumberValue` parented to a `Class.Humanoid` to control its
      scaling.

      When the longest axis is the vertical axis, this property will behave
      similar to the `Class.Camera.FieldOfView|FieldOfView` property. This is
      generally the case when a device is in a portrait orientation. In a
      landscape orientation, the longest axis will be the horizontal axis; in
      this case, the property describes the horizontal field of view of the
      `Class.Camera`.

      clipping plane is, in studs. The near clipping plane is a geometric plane
      that sits in front of the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame`. Anything between
      this plane and the camera will not render, creating a cutaway view when
      viewing objects at very short distances. The value of **NearPlaneZ**
      varies across different platforms and is currently always between -0.1 and
      -0.5.

      This property toggles whether to apply tilt and roll from the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` property while the player is using a VR device.

      To prevent motion sickness, the horizon should remain level. Tilting and
      rolling the player's view while using a VR device can cause a disconnect
      between the player's physical space and the virtual space they are
      viewing. Changing the apparent downwards direction can cause players to
      lose balance or experience dizziness.

      For these reasons, it is generally advisable to leave this property
      disabled, unless you have extensively tested your experience for these
      effects. Even with tilt and roll enabled, you may want to ensure the
      player always has a stable reference frame, such as the interior of a
      vehicle or a floor that can help the player ground themselves in their
      physical space.

      This method returns an array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are
      obscuring the lines of sight between the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      and `Datatype.Vector3` positions in the `castPoints` array. Any
      `Class.Instance|Instances` included in the `ignoreList` array will be
      ignored, along with their descendants.

      The `castPoints` parameter is given as an array of `Datatype.Vector3`
      positions. Note that the array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` returned is
      in an arbitrary order, and no additional raycast data is provided. If you
      need data such as hit position, hit material, or surface normal, you
      should opt for the `Class.WorldRoot:Raycast()` method.

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

      local castPoints = {
      	Vector3.new(0, 10, 0),
      	Vector3.new(0, 15, 0)
      }
      local ignoreList = {}

      local partsObscuringTarget = camera:GetPartsObscuringTarget(castPoints, ignoreList)
      ```

      If `Class.Terrain` obscures a cast point, `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
      obscuring the cast point between the obscuring `Class.Terrain` and the
      cast point will not be returned.

      This function returns the actual `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`
      as it is rendered, including the impact of VR (VR head transformations are
      not applied to the `Class.Camera.CFrame` property, so it is best practice
      to use `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()` to obtain the "true"
      `Datatype.CFrame` of a player's view).

      For example, when using VR, the `Class.Camera` is actually rendered at the
      following `Datatype.CFrame`:

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

      local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
      headCFrame = headCFrame.Rotation + headCFrame.Position * camera.HeadScale
      renderCFrame = camera.CFrame * headCFrame
      ```

      The camera's render `Datatype.CFrame` will only be changed to account for
      the head when the `Class.Camera.HeadLocked` property is true.

    description: |
      This function tweens the `Class.Camera` in a linear fashion towards a new
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` and `Class.Camera.Focus` over a given duration, for
      example:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

      camera:Interpolate(
      	CFrame.new(0, 10, 100),
      	CFrame.new(0, 0, 100),
      	5
      )
      ```

      Throughout the tween, the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame` will be
      orientated towards the camera's `Class.Camera.Focus`.

      When the tween has completed, the camera's
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished` event will fire.

      If this function is called while the `Class.Camera` is already tweening
      the older tween will be stopped (without firing
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished`) and overridden by the new tween.

      Interpolate can only be used if the current `Class.Camera.CameraType` is
      _'Scriptable'_, regardless of whether the default camera scripts are being
      used. If it is used with any other `Class.Camera.CameraType` an error will
      be thrown.

      You are advised to use `Class.TweenService` to tween the `Class.Camera`
      instead as it is more reliable and offers a variety of easing styles. See
      below for an example:

      ```lua

      Creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a position on the screen (in pixels),

    description: |
      This function creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a 2D position on the
      screen (defined in pixels), accounting for the GUI inset. The
      `Datatype.Ray` originates from the `Datatype.Vector3` equivalent of the 2D
      position in the world at the given depth (in studs) away from the
      `Class.Camera`.

      As this function acknowledges the GUI inset, the offset applied to GUI
      elements (such as from the top bar) is accounted for. This means the
      screen position specified will start in the top left corner below the top
      bar. For an otherwise identical function that does not account for the GUI
      offset, use `Class.Camera:ViewportPointToRay()`.

      As the `Datatype.Ray` created is a unit ray, it is only one stud long. To
      create a longer ray, you can do the following:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local length = 500
      local unitRay = camera:ScreenPointToRay(100, 100)
      local extendedRay = Ray.new(unitRay.Origin, unitRay.Direction * length)
      ```

      This function only works for the current Workspace camera. Other cameras,
      such as those you create for a `Class.ViewportFrame`, have an initial
      viewport size of `(1, 1)` and are only updated after you set them to
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. The mismatch in viewport size causes the
      camera to return a ray with an incorrect `Datatype.Ray.Direction`.

    description: |
      This function is outdated and no longer considered best practice.

      This function sets the current roll, in radians, of the `Class.Camera`.
      The roll is applied after the `Class.Camera.CFrame` and represents the
      rotation around the camera's Z-axis.

      For example, the following would invert the `Class.Camera`:

      ```lua
      workspace.CurrentCamera:SetRoll(math.pi) -- math.pi radians = 180 degrees
      ```

      SetRoll has no effect on any roll applied using the `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      property. Roll applied using SetRoll is not reflected in the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` property but is reflected in the `Datatype.CFrame`
      returned by`Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()`.

      This function can only be used when the `Class.Camera.CameraType` is set
      to _'Scriptable'_, regardless of whether the default camera scripts are
      being used. If it is used with any other `Class.Camera.CameraType` a
      warning is given in the output.

      Any roll applied using this function will be lost when the
      `Class.Camera.CameraType` is changed from _'Scriptable'_.

      To obtain the roll set using this function use `Class.Camera:GetRoll()`.

      As this function is outdated, you are advised to instead apply roll to the
      `Class.Camera` using the `Class.Camera.CFrame` property. For example:

      ```lua
      local currentCFrame = workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame
      local rollCFrame = CFrame.Angles(0, 0, roll)
      workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = currentCFrame * rollCFrame

      you are not using `Class.ScreenGui.IgnoreGuiInset` and need an otherwise
      identical function that accounts for the GUI offset, use
      `Class.Camera:ScreenPointToRay()`.

      This function can be used in conjunction with the
      `Class.Camera.ViewportSize` property to create a ray from the centre of
      the screen, for example:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local viewportPoint = camera.ViewportSize / 2
      local unitRay = camera:ViewportPointToRay(viewportPoint.X, viewportPoint.Y, 0)

      `Class.Camera:WorldToViewportPoint()`.

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

      local worldPoint = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local vector, onScreen = camera:WorldToScreenPoint(worldPoint)

      local screenPoint = Vector2.new(vector.X, vector.Y)
      local depth = vector.Z
      ```

      Note this function does not perform any raycasting and the boolean
      indicating whether `worldPoint` is within the bounds of the screen will be
      `true` regardless of whether the point is obscured by
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` or `Class.Terrain`.

            of the `worldPoint` from the top left corner of the screen, in
            pixels. The `Datatype.Vector3` **Z** component represents the depth
            of the `worldPoint` from the screen (in studs).

          - A boolean indicating if the `worldPoint` is within the bounds of the
            screen.

      This function returns the screen location and depth of a
      `Datatype.Vector3` `worldPoint` and whether this point is within the
      bounds of the screen.

      This function does not take in account the current GUI inset, such as the
      space occupied by the top bar, meaning that the 2D position returned is
      taken from the top left corner of the viewport. Unless you are using
      `Class.ScreenGui.IgnoreGuiInset`, this position is not appropriate for
      placing GUI elements.

      For an otherwise identical function that accounts for the GUI inset, see
      `Class.Camera:WorldToScreenPoint()`.

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera

      local worldPoint = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local vector, onScreen = camera:WorldToViewportPoint(worldPoint)

      local viewportPoint = Vector2.new(vector.X, vector.Y)
      local depth = vector.Z
      ```

      Note this function does not perform any raycasting and the boolean
      indicating whether `worldPoint` is within the bounds of the screen will be
      `true` regardless of whether the point is obscured by
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` or `Class.Terrain`.

      This event fires when the `Class.Camera` has finished interpolating using
      the `Class.Camera:Interpolate()` function.

      This event will not fire if a tween is interrupted due to
      `Class.Camera:Interpolate()` being called again.

      You are advised to use `Class.TweenService` to animate the `Class.Camera`
      instead, as it is more reliable and provides more options for easing
      styles.
