summary: |
  A class which defines a view of the 3D world.
description: |
  The `Camera` object defines a view of the 3D world. In a running experience,
  each client has its own `Camera` object which resides in that client's local
  `Class.Workspace`, accessible through the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`
  property.

  The most important camera properties are:

  - `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` which represents the position and orientation
    of the camera.

  - `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` which is read by the experience's
    camera scripts and determines how the camera should update each frame.

  - `Class.Camera.CameraSubject|CameraSubject` which is read by the experience's
    camera scripts and determines what object the camera should follow.

  - `Class.Camera.FieldOfView|FieldOfView` which represents the visible extent
    of the observable world.

  - `Class.Camera.Focus|Focus` which represents the point the camera is looking
    at. It's important this property is set, as certain visuals will be more
    detailed and will update more frequently depending on how close they are to
    the focus point.

  See [Customizing the Camera](../../../workspace/camera.md) for more
  information on how to adjust and customize the camera's behavior.

  #### Storing Multiple Cameras

  Note that when changing `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` to a new
  `Class.Camera`, all other `Class.Camera|Cameras` directly descending from
  `Class.Workspace` will be destroyed. If you need to store multiple cameras and
  swap between them on demand, it's recommended that you store them in a
  `Class.Folder` or `Class.Model` under `Class.Workspace`, inside which they
  will remain even when `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera` is
  changed.

    summary: |
      The `Class.Humanoid` or `Class.BasePart` that is the `Class.Camera`
      subject.
    description: |
      `CameraSubject` accepts a variety of `Class.Instance|Instances`. The
      default camera scripts respond differently to the available settings:

      - By default, the camera scripts follow the local character's
        `Class.Humanoid`, factoring in the humanoid's current state and
        `Class.Humanoid.CameraOffset`.

      - When set to a `Class.BasePart`, the camera scripts follow its position,
        with a vertical offset in the case of `Class.VehicleSeat|VehicleSeats`.

      `CameraSubject` cannot be set to `nil`. Attempting to do so will revert it
      to its previous value.

      To restore `CameraSubject` to its default value, set it to the local
      character's `Class.Humanoid`:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera

      local function resetCameraSubject()
      	if camera and localPlayer.Character then
      		local humanoid = localPlayer.Character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
      		if humanoid then
      			camera.CameraSubject = humanoid
      		end
      	end
      end
      ```

      this property toggles between the various `Enum.CameraType` behaviors.
      Note that some camera types require a valid

      The default camera scripts will not move or update the camera if
      `CameraType` is set to `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable`. For more information
      on positioning and orienting the camera manually, see
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame`.

      For all `CameraType` settings **except** `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable`, the

      whose position the camera's `Class.Camera.Focus|Focus` is set to.

      The `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`, defining its position and
      orientation in the 3D world.
    description: |
      This property is the `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`, defining its
      position and orientation in the 3D world. Note that some transformations,
      such as the rotation of the head when using VR devices, are not reflected
      in this property, so you should use
      `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()|GetRenderCFrame()` to obtain the "true"
      `Datatype.CFrame` of the camera.

      You can move the camera by setting this property. However, the default
      camera scripts also set it, so you should either:

      - Set the camera `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` to
        `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable` so that the default camera scripts will not
        update the camera's `Datatype.CFrame`. This method is simplest and
        recommended in most cases.

      - Completely replace the default camera scripts with alternatives. This
        approach is only recommended if you do not need any default camera
        functionality.

      The most intuitive way to position and orient the `Class.Camera` is by
      using the `Datatype.CFrame.lookAt()` constructor. In the following
      example, the `Class.Camera` is positioned at
      `Datatype.Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)` and is oriented to be looking towards
      `Datatype.Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)`.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera
      camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

      local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local lookAtPos = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)

      Workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos, lookAtPos)
      ```

      Although the camera can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you
      may want to animate it to move smoothly from one `Datatype.CFrame` to
      another. For this, you can either:

      - Set the camera's position/orientation every frame with
        `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` and the `Datatype.CFrame:Lerp()`
        method.
      - Create and play a `Class.Tween` that animates the position/orientation
        of the camera:

        ```lua
        local Players = game:GetService("Players")
        local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")
        local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

        local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera
        camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

        local player = Players.LocalPlayer
        local character = player.Character
        if not character or character.Parent == nil then
        	character = player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
        end

        local pos = camera.CFrame * Vector3.new(0, 20, 0)
        local lookAtPos = character.PrimaryPart.Position
        local targetCFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos, lookAtPos)

        local tween = TweenService:Create(camera, TweenInfo.new(2), {CFrame = targetCFrame})

        tween:Play()
        ```

    description: |
      The `FieldOfView` (FOV) property sets how many degrees in the vertical
      direction the camera can view. This property is clamped between `1` and
      `120` degrees and defaults at `70`. Very low or very high fields of view
      are not recommended as they can be disorientating to players.

      Note that uniform scaling is enforced, meaning the vertical and horizontal
      field of view are always related by the aspect ratio of the screen.

      Suggested uses for `FieldOfView` include:

      - Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification, for example when
        using binoculars.
      - Increasing FOV when the player is "sprinting" to give the impression of
        a lack of control.

      Note that `FieldOfView` represents the field of view that is visible by
      the `Class.Camera` rendering into the fullscreen area which may be
      occluded by notches or screen cutouts on some devices. See
      `Class.Camera.ViewportSize|ViewportSize` for more information.

      For example, when this property is set to `Enum.FieldOfViewMode.Vertical`,
      the horizontal FOV is updated when the viewport is resized, but the
      vertical FOV is kept constant. If this property is set to
      `Enum.FieldOfViewMode.Diagonal`, both horizontal and vertical FOV might be

    summary: |
      Sets the area in 3D space that is prioritized by Roblox's graphical
      systems.
    description: |
      Certain graphical operations the engine performs, such as updating
      lighting, can take time or computational effort to complete. The camera's
      `Focus` property tells the engine which area in 3D space to prioritize
      when performing such operations. For example, dynamic lighting from
      objects such as `Class.PointLight|PointLights` may not render at distances
      far from the focus.

      The default Roblox camera scripts automatically set `Focus` to follow the
      `Class.Camera.CameraSubject|CameraSubject` (usually a `Class.Humanoid`).
      However, `Focus` will **not** automatically update when
      `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` is set to
      `Enum.CameraType.Scriptable` or when the default camera scripts are not
      being used. In these cases, you should update `Focus` every frame, using
      `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` method at the
      `Enum.RenderPriority.Camera` priority.

      `Focus` has no bearing on the position or orientation of the camera; see
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` for this.

    description: |
      Toggles whether the camera will automatically track the head motion of a
      player using a VR device. When `true` (default), the engine combines
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` with the `Enum.UserCFrame` of the user's head
      to render the player's view with head tracking factored in. The view will
      be rendered at the following `Datatype.CFrame`:

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera

      local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
      headCFrame = headCFrame.Rotation + headCFrame.Position * camera.HeadScale

      -- This will be equivalent to Camera:GetRenderCFrame()
      local renderCFrame = camera.CFrame * headCFrame
      ```

      It is recommended to **not** disable this property for the following
      reasons:

      - Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking
        solution is not added.
      - The Roblox Engine performs latency optimizations when `HeadLocked` is
        true.

      ##### See Also

        `Datatype.CFrame` of the head.

        head to the current position and orientation of the VR device.

      `HeadScale` is the scale of the user's perspective of the world when using
      VR.

      The size of 1 stud in VR is `0.3 meters / HeadScale`, meaning that larger
      `HeadScale` values equate to the world looking smaller from the user's
      perspective when using VR devices. For example, a part that's 1 stud tall
      appears to be 0.6 meters tall to a VR player with a `HeadScale` of `0.5`.

      This property is automatically controlled by
      `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` to align the player's perspective with
      the size of their avatar. If you intend to control `HeadScale` yourself or
      use custom characters, toggle `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` to
      `Enum.VRScaling.Off`.

      This property should not be confused with `Class.Humanoid.HeadScale` which
      is a `Class.NumberValue` parented to a `Class.Humanoid` to control its
      scaling.

      The dimensions of the device safe area on a Roblox client.
    description: |
      `ViewportSize` returns the dimensions of the device safe area on the
      current screen. This area is a rectangle which includes the Roblox top bar
      area but does not include any device notches or screen cutouts. The units
      of `ViewportSize` are Roblox UI offset units which may be different from
      native display pixels.

      <img src="../../../assets/engine-api/classes/Camera/DeviceSafeAreaVsFullscreen.png" width="840" alt="Mobile device screen with cutout showing device safe area." />

      As noted above, `ViewportSize` is not equal to the fullscreen area size on
      displays with cutouts or notches. To obtain the fullscreen area size on
      all displays, you can query the
      `Class.ScreenGui.AbsoluteSize|AbsoluteSize` property of a
      `Class.ScreenGui` with `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` set to
      `Enum.ScreenInsets.None|None`. See `Enum.ScreenInsets` for a more
      information about how screen areas are defined.

      Finally, note that `ViewportSize` is not the actual viewport size the
      camera uses for rendering (the camera renders in the fullscreen area).
      Also, the `Class.Camera.FieldOfView|FieldOfView` and
      `Class.Camera.DiagonalFieldOfView|DiagonalFieldOfView` properties are
      based on the fullscreen area, not `ViewportSize`.

      ##### Camera Updates

      Only the `Class.Camera` currently referred to by
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` has its `ViewportSize` updated each frame
      during the `Class.RunService.PreRender|PreRender` step. The `ViewportSize`
      of all other cameras in your experience won't be updated, including those
      used for `Class.ViewportFrame|ViewportFrames`.

      This property toggles whether to apply tilt and roll from the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` property while the player is using a VR
      device.

      To prevent motion sickness, the horizon should remain level. Tilting and
      rolling the player's view while using a VR device can cause a disconnect
      between the player's physical space and the virtual space they are
      viewing. Changing the apparent downwards direction can cause players to
      lose balance or experience dizziness.

      For these reasons, it is generally advisable to leave this property
      disabled, unless you have extensively tested your experience for these
      effects. Even with tilt and roll enabled, you may want to ensure the
      player always has a stable reference frame, such as the interior of a
      vehicle or a floor that can help the player ground themselves in their

      This method returns the actual `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera` as

      obtain the "true" `Datatype.CFrame` of a player's view).

      For example, when using VR, the `Class.Camera` is actually rendered at the

      renderCFrame = camera.CFrame * headCFrame

      This method tweens the `Class.Camera` in a linear fashion towards a new
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` and `Class.Camera.Focus|Focus` over a given
      duration, for example:

      ```lua

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera
      camera.CameraType = Enum.CameraType.Scriptable

      camera:Interpolate(

      	CFrame.new(0, 0, 100),
      	5
      )
      ```

      Throughout the tween, the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` will be
      orientated towards the camera's `Class.Camera.Focus|Focus`.

      When the tween has completed, the camera's
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished|InterpolationFinished` event will
      fire.

      If this method is called while the `Class.Camera` is already tweening, the
      older tween will be stopped (without firing
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished|InterpolationFinished`) and overridden
      by the new tween.

      Interpolate can only be used if the current
      `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` is `Scriptable`, regardless of
      whether the default camera scripts are being used. If it is used with any
      other `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` an error will be thrown.

      You are advised to use `Class.TweenService` to tween the `Class.Camera`
      instead as it is more reliable and offers a variety of easing styles. See

    description: |
      This method creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a 2D position on the screen
      (defined in pixels), accounting for the GUI inset. The `Datatype.Ray`
      originates from the `Datatype.Vector3` equivalent of the 2D position in
      the world at the given depth (in studs) away from the `Class.Camera`.

      As this method acknowledges the GUI inset, the offset applied to GUI
      elements (such as from the top bar) is accounted for. This means the
      screen position specified will start in the top left corner below the top
      bar. For an otherwise identical method that does not account for the GUI
      offset, use `Class.Camera:ViewportPointToRay()|ViewportPointToRay()`.

      As the `Datatype.Ray` created is a unit ray, it is only one stud long. To
      create a longer ray, you can do the following:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera
      local length = 500
      local unitRay = camera:ScreenPointToRay(100, 100)
      local extendedRay = Ray.new(unitRay.Origin, unitRay.Direction * length)
      ```

      This method only works for the current `Class.Workspace` camera. Other
      cameras, such as those you create for a `Class.ViewportFrame`, have an
      initial viewport size of <Typography noWrap>`(1, 1)`</Typography> and are
      only updated after you set them to `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`. The
      mismatch in viewport size causes the camera to return a ray with an
      incorrect `Datatype.Ray.Direction`.

    description: |
      This method is outdated and no longer considered best practice.

      This method sets the current roll, in radians, of the `Class.Camera`. The
      roll is applied after the `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` and represents the
      rotation around the camera's Z-axis.

      For example, the following would invert the `Class.Camera`:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      Workspace.CurrentCamera:SetRoll(math.pi) -- math.pi radians = 180 degrees
      ```

      SetRoll has no effect on any roll applied using the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` property. Roll applied using SetRoll is not
      reflected in the `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` property but is reflected in
      the `Datatype.CFrame` returned
      by`Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()|GetRenderCFrame()`.

      This method can only be used when the `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType`
      is set to `Scriptable`, regardless of whether the default camera scripts
      are being used. If it is used with any other
      `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` a warning is given in the output.

      Any roll applied using this method will be lost when the
      `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraType` is changed from `Scriptable`.

      To obtain the roll set using this method use
      `Class.Camera:GetRoll()|GetRoll()`.

      As this method is outdated, you are advised to instead apply roll to the
      `Class.Camera` using the `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` property. For

    description: |
      This method creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a 2D position in device
      safe viewport coordinates, defined in pixels. The ray originates from the
      `Datatype.Vector3` equivalent of the 2D position in the world at the given
      depth (in studs) away from the `Class.Camera`.

      As illustrated below, `(0, 0)` corresponds to the top‑left point of the
      Roblox top bar. This means that the input 2D position does **not** account
      for the `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets` inset, but it does account
      for any `Enum.ScreenInsets|DeviceSafeInsets`.

      <img src="../../../assets/engine-api/classes/Camera/ViewportPointToRayOrigin.png" width="840" alt="Diagram showing the origin of the device safe area viewport coordinate system." />

      Note that UI instances use a different coordinate system
      (`Class.GuiObject.AbsolutePosition` uses the
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets` viewport coordinate system while this
      method uses the `Enum.ScreenInsets|DeviceSafeInsets` viewport coordinate
      system). If you would like to specify position in core UI coordinates,
      please use `Class.Camera:ScreenPointToRay()|ScreenPointToRay()`.

      Also note that this method only works for the
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` camera. Other cameras, such as those you
      create for a `Class.ViewportFrame`, have an initial viewport size of
      `(1, 1)` and are only updated after you set them to
      `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera`. The mismatch in viewport
      size causes the camera to return a ray with an incorrect
      `Datatype.Ray.Direction`.

      This method can be used in conjunction with the
      `Class.Camera.ViewportSize|ViewportSize` property to create a ray from the
      centre of the screen, for example:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera

      local viewportPoint = camera.ViewportSize / 2
      local unitRay = camera:ViewportPointToRay(viewportPoint.X, viewportPoint.Y, 0)
      ```

      As the `Datatype.Ray` created is a unit ray, it is only one stud long. To
      create a longer ray, you can do the following:

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera

      local length = 500
      local unitRay = camera:ScreenPointToRay(100, 100)
      local extendedRay = Ray.new(unitRay.Origin, unitRay.Direction * length)
      ```

      This method returns the screen location and depth of a `Datatype.Vector3`
      `worldPoint` and whether this point is within the bounds of the screen.

      This method takes in account the current GUI inset, such as the space
      occupied by the top bar, meaning that the 2D position returned is in the
      same term as GUI positions and can be used to place GUI elements. For an
      otherwise identical method that ignores the GUI inset, see
      `Class.Camera:WorldToViewportPoint()|WorldToViewportPoint()`.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

      local camera = Workspace.CurrentCamera

      local worldPoint = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local vector, onScreen = camera:WorldToScreenPoint(worldPoint)

      local screenPoint = Vector2.new(vector.X, vector.Y)
      local depth = vector.Z
      ```

      Note this method does not perform any raycasting and the boolean
      indicating whether `worldPoint` is within the bounds of the screen will be
      `true` regardless of whether the point is obscured by
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` or `Class.Terrain`.

      This method adjusts the `Class.Camera.CFrame|CFrame` so that a specified
      bounding box is fully visible within the camera's viewport, without
      cropping any part of the box.

      The bounding box is defined by its center and orientation
      (`boundingBoxCFrame`) and its size (`boundingBoxSize`).

      This can be used to focus the camera on a 3D object or model, such as when
      framing content in a `Class.ViewportFrame`, taking screenshots, or
      smoothly transitioning the camera to highlight specific content.

      The method automatically accounts for the camera's field of view and
      viewport aspect ratio to ensure the entire bounding box fits.

      ```lua
      local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")
