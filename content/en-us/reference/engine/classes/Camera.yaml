  The Camera object defines a view of the 3D game world.

  ## Where the Camera object is found

  In an instance of the game, each client has its own Camera object associated
  with it. Camera objects exist only upon the viewer's client, residing in that
  user's local Workspace, and therefore cannot be edited directly from the
  server.

  Each client's particular Camera object can be accessed through the
  `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` property of the `Class.Workspace` on that
  client.

  Note, `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera` can also be used to find the Camera
  object in Roblox Studio.

  ## How the Camera object works

  The Camera's properties define the current view of the 3D game world. The most
  important of these being:

  - The `Class.Camera.CFrame` property represents the position and orientation
    of the camera.
  - The `Class.Camera.Focus` property represents the point the camera is looking
    at. It is important this property is set as it also represents where the
    game thinks you are in the world. Certain visuals will be more detailed and
    will update more frequently, depending on how close they are to the Focus.
    Roblox's default camera scripts take care of this.
  - The `Class.Camera.CameraType` property is read by the game's camera scripts
    and determines how the Camera should update each frame.
  - The `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` property is read by the game's camera
    scripts and determines what object the Camera should follow.
  - The `Class.Camera.FieldOfView` property represents the extent of the
    observable world visible.

  ## How to work with the Camera

  Roblox's camera scripts update the Camera's properties every frame dependent
  on the current `Class.Camera.CameraType`. This means developers looking to
  control the Camera themselves have two options.

  1. Setting the `Class.Camera.CameraType` property to _'Scriptable'_. When the
     Camera is in _'Scriptable'_ mode the default camera scripts will not update
     the camera. In most cases this is the easiest option.
  2. Replacing or modifying the default camera scripts in
     `Class.StarterPlayerScripts|StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts`. This is
     only recommended for advanced developers.

    summary: |
      The `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`, defining its position and
      orientation in the 3D world.
    description: |
      This property is the `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera` and defines
      its position and orientation in the 3D world.

      Some transformations, such as the rotation of the head when using VR
      devices are not reflected in this property. For this reason, developers
      should use `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()` to obtain the 'true'
      `Datatype.CFrame` of the camera.

      #### How to set the camera's CFrame

      You can move the camera by setting the CFrame property. However, the
      default camera scripts also set the CFrame property. When manually setting
      the CFrame property, it may be overwritten by the [camera scripts][1]
      which update every frame. There are two options to address this:

      1. Set the camera `Class.Camera.CameraType` to _'Scriptable'_. When the
         camera is _'Scriptable'_ the default scripts will not update the
         CFrame. This method is simplest and recommended in most cases

      2. Replace the default camera scripts with an alternative that doesn't
         interfere with the developer's desired implementation. This is only
         recommended when developers do not need any default camera's
         functionality

      #### How the Camera CFrame works

      Like all `Datatype.CFrame` data, the camera CFrame represents a position
      and an orientation.

      The most intuitive way to position and orientate the `Class.Camera` is by
      using the `Datatype.CFrame.lookAt()` constructor:

      ```lua
      local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local lookAtPos = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)
      local cameraCFrame = CFrame.lookAt(pos, lookAtPos)
      workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = cameraCFrame
      ```

      In the above example the `Class.Camera` is positioned at _Vector3.new(0,
      10, 0)_ and oriented to be looking towards _Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)_.

      #### Animating the Camera CFrame

      Although the camera can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you
      may want to animate the Camera to smoothly move from one CFrame to
      another. For this, there are a number of options:

      1. Creating a `Class.Tween` using `Class.TweenService` that animates the
         CFrame property of the camera. See the code sample below for an example
         of this
      2. Setting the camera CFrame every frame with
         `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` and the _lerp_ CFrame method

      The `Class.Humanoid` or `Class.BasePart` that is the `Class.Camera`
      subject.
    description: |
      When using the default camera scripts, the CameraSubject property has two
      roles:

      - Defining the object the `Class.Camera` is to follow, in the case of the
        _'Follow'_, _'Attach'_, _'Track'_, _'Watch'_ and _'Custom'_
        `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraTypes`
      - For all `Class.Camera.CameraType|CameraTypes` but _'Scriptable'_, the
        object whose position the camera's `Class.Camera.Focus` will be set to

      CameraSubject accepts a variety of `Class.Instance|Instances`. The default
      camera scripts respond differently to different CameraSubject types:

      - `Class.Humanoid` — By default the CameraSubject is set to the
        `Class.Player.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` `Class.Humanoid`. The camera
        scripts will follow the `Class.Humanoid` factoring in the humanoid's
        current state and `Class.Humanoid.CameraOffset`
      - `Class.BasePart` — The camera scripts will follow the position of any
        `Class.BasePart`, with a vertical offset in the case of
        `Class.VehicleSeat|VehicleSeats`

      You can configure the `Class.Camera` to follow a `Class.Model` by setting
      the CameraSubject to the model's `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`.

      The CameraSubject cannot be set to _nil_. If it is, it will revert to its
      previous value.

      To restore the CameraSubject to its default value, set it to the
      `Class.Player.LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer` `Class.Humanoid` like so:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer

      local function resetCameraSubject()
      	if workspace.CurrentCamera and localPlayer.Character then
      		local humanoid = localPlayer.Character:FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid")
      		if humanoid then
      			workspace.CurrentCamera.CameraSubject = humanoid
      		end
      	end
      end

    description: |
      The default Roblox camera scripts have several built in behaviors. Setting
      the CameraType of a player's `Class.Camera` will toggle between these
      behaviors. Note some CameraType's require a valid
      `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` to work correctly.

      - Fixed: `Class.Camera` is stationary
      - Follow: `Class.Camera` moves with the `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` and
        rotates to keep the subject in the center of view
      - Attach: `Class.Camera` moves with the `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` at a
        fixed offset and will rotate as the subject rotates
      - Track: `Class.Camera` moves with the `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` but
        does not rotate automatically
      - Watch: `Class.Camera` is stationary but will rotate to keep the
        `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` in the center of view
      - Custom: Default
      - Scriptable: No default behavior. Used by developers to script custom
        behavior

      The above only applies when you use the default Roblox [camera
      scripts][1]. If you write your own camera scripts, you can choose to
      listen to CameraType and implement your own behaviors or ignore the
      property entirely.

      #### Manually controlling the Camera

      In some cases you may wish to manually control the `Class.Camera` (for
      example during a cut-scene). The best way to do this is by setting the
      CameraType to _'Scriptable'_. The default camera scripts will not move or
      update the `Class.Camera` on its own if CameraType is set to
      _'Scriptable'_. This means you can freely modify the `Class.Camera` using
      its properties and functions. For more information on positioning and
      orientating the `Class.Camera` manually see the `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      page.

      If you want complete control over the camera at all times, you may replace
      the default camera scripts with your own.

      Sets the angle of the camera's vertical field of view.
    description: |
      Field of view, often shortened to FOV, is the extent of the observable
      game world that can be seen on screen at a given moment. The FieldOfView
      property is clamped between 1 and 120 degrees and defaults at 70. Very low
      or very high fields of view are not recommended as they can be
      disorientating to players.

      The FieldOfView property sets how many degrees in the vertical direction
      (y-axis) the camera can view. Uniform scaling is enforced meaning the
      vertical and horizontal field of view are always related by the
      [aspect ratio](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)>) of
      the screen. This means the FieldOfView property also determines the
      horizontal field of view.

      See the images below for an example of how different FieldOfView settings
      can impact the extent of the perceptive game world. At a FOV of 70, a
      considerable portion of the game world is visible:

      ![A demonstration of the default FOV of 70](/assets/legacy/Fov70.png)

      However when the FOV is reduced to 30, although the camera's
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` has not changed, a much smaller portion of the game
      world is rendered:

      ![A demonstration of a reduced FOV of 30](/assets/legacy/Fov30.png)

      #### Suggested uses for FieldOfView

      Changing FOV can produce a variety of effects, such as:

      - Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification (for example when
        using binoculars)
      - Increasing FOV when the player is 'sprinting' to give the impression of
        a lack of control

      viewport is resized, while the vertical FOV is kept constant. On the other
      hand, if the value is set to `Enum.FieldOfViewMode.Diagonal`, both
      horizontal and vertical FOV might be changed to keep the diagonal FOV
      constant.

    summary: |
      Sets the area in 3D space that is prioritized by Roblox's graphical
      systems.
    description: |
      The `Class.Camera` Focus is a `Datatype.CFrame` that determines the area
      in 3D space the graphics engine will prioritize.

      Certain graphical operations Roblox performs, such as updating lighting,
      can take a lot of time or computational effort to complete. Focus tells
      Roblox the area in 3D space to prioritize when performing such operations.
      For example dynamic lighting from objects such as
      `Class.PointLight|PointLights` may not render at distances far from the
      Focus.

      The default Roblox camera scripts automatically set the Focus to follow
      the `Class.Camera.CameraSubject` (usually a `Class.Humanoid`). However,
      Focus will not be automatically updated in the following cases:

      - When the `Class.Camera.CameraType` is set to _'Scriptable'_
      - When the default camera scripts are not being used

      In these cases, you should update Focus every frame, using
      `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` function at the _'Camera'_
      `Enum.RenderPriority`.

      Focus has no bearing on the positioning or orientation of the
      `Class.Camera` (see `Class.Camera.CFrame` for this).

      Un-linking the camera from a VR user's head motions can cause motion

      testing.

      Toggles whether the `Class.Camera` will automatically track the head
      motion of a player using a VR device.

      When HeadLocked is _true_, the engine will combine `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      with the `Enum.UserCFrame` of the user's head to render the player's view
      with head tracking factored in. The view will be rendered at the following
      `Datatype.CFrame`:

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
      local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
      headCFrame = headCFrame.Rotation + headCFrame.Position * workspace.CurrentCamera.HeadScale
      -- this will be equivalent to Camera:GetRenderCFrame()
      local renderCFrame = workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame * headCFrame
      ```

      #### Disabling HeadLocked

      You are recommended not to disable HeadLocked for the following reasons:

      - Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking
        solution is not added
      - The Roblox engine performs latency optimizations when HeadLocked is true

      See also:

      - `Class.VRService:GetUserCFrame()` which can be used to obtain the
        `Datatype.CFrame` of the head
      - `Class.VRService:RecenterUserHeadCFrame()` which is used to recenter the
        head to the current position and orientation of the VR device
      - The `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()` function which returns the
        `Class.Camera` `Class.Camera.CFrame` combined with the `Datatype.CFrame`
        of the user's head

      HeadScale is the scale of the user's perspective of the world when using
      VR.

      The size of a stud in VR is:

      _1 stud = 0.3 meters / HeadScale_

      This means the larger the HeadScale value, the smaller the world will look
      from the user's perspective when using VR devices and vice versa. For
      example, a part that is 1 stud tall appears to be 0.6 meters tall to a VR
      player with a HeadScale = 0.5.

      This property is automatically controlled by
      `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` to align the player's perspective with
      the size of their avatar. If you intend to control HeadScale yourself or
      use custom characters, toggle `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` =
      `Enum.VRScaling.Off`.

      When not using VR, this property has no effect.

      This property should not be confused with `Class.Humanoid` HeadScale,
      which is a `Class.NumberValue` parented to a `Class.Humanoid` to control
      its scaling.

      The NearPlaneZ property describes how far away the Camera's near clipping
      plane is in studs. The near clipping plane is a geometric plane that sits
      in-front of the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame`. Anything between this
      plane and the camera will not render. This creates a cutaway view when
      viewing objects at very short distances. See the images below for a visual
      example of this:

      ![A demonstration of how anything falling behind the clipping plane is not rendered](/assets/legacy/NearPlaneZ2.jpg)

      The value of NearPlaneZ varies across different platforms, but is
      currently always between _-0.1_ and _-0.5_.

      - Most windows systems, all Xbox systems and most iOS systems support the
        more precise value of _-0.1_
      - Currently Mac and Android systems only support a NearPlaneZ of _-0.5_,

      This property toggles whether to apply tilt and roll from the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` property while the player is using a VR device.

      To prevent motion sickness, the horizon should remain level. Tilting and
      rolling the player's view while using a VR device can cause a disconnect
      between the player's physical space and the virtual space they are
      viewing. Changing the apparent downwards direction can cause players to
      lose balance or experience dizziness.

      For these reasons, it is generally advisable to leave this property
      disabled, unless you have extensively tested your experience for these
      effects. Even with tilt and roll enabled, you may want to ensure the
      player always has a stable reference frame, such as the interior of a
      vehicle or a floor that can help the player ground themselves in their
      physical space.

      This function returns an array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` that are
      obscuring the lines of sight between camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame` and
      the _castPoints_.

      GetPartsObscuringTarget is used by the 'Invisicam' in the default camera
      scripts to hide parts between the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame` and
      `Class.Camera.Focus`.

      Any `Class.Instance|Instances` included in the _ignoreList_ array will,
      along with their descendants, be ignored.

      See below for a visual example of this function. The `Class.Camera` is
      represented by the grey camera model and the cast points are represented
      by the colored dots. The `Class.Part|Parts` highlighted in red are the
      ones that would be returned.

      ![A visual demonstration of the function](/assets/legacy/GetPartsObscuringTarget.png)

      The castPoints parameter is given as an array of
      `Datatype.Vector3|Vector3s`, for example:

      ```lua
      local castPoints = {Vector3.new(0, 10, 0), Vector3.new(0, 15, 0)}
      local ignoreList = {}
      workspace.CurrentCamera:GetPartsObscuringTarget(castPoints, ignoreList)
      ```

      The array of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` returned is in an arbitrary order,
      and no additional raycast data is provided (for example hit position, hit
      material and surface normal). If this information is required, you should
      a `Class.Workspace` raycast function such as
      `Class.Workspace.FindPartOnRayWithIgnoreList`.

      If `Class.Terrain` obscures a cast point, `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
      obscuring the cast point between the obscuring `Class.Terrain` and the
      cast point will not be returned.

      Note, this function benefits from internal optimisations that make it more
      performant than casting a ray for each cast point individually.

    description: |
      This function returns the actual `Datatype.CFrame` of the `Class.Camera`
      as it is rendered, including the impact of VR.

      VR head transformations are not applied to the `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      property. For this reason, it is best practice to use
      `Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()` to obtain the 'true' `Datatype.CFrame` of
      a player's view.

      For example, when using VR the `Class.Camera` is actually rendered at the
      following `Datatype.CFrame`:

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
      headCFrame = headCFrame.Rotation + headCFrame.Position * workspace.CurrentCamera.HeadScale
      renderCFrame = workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame * headCFrame
      ```

      The camera's render `Datatype.CFrame` will only be changed to account for
      the head when the `Class.Camera.HeadLocked` property is true.

      This function tweens the `Class.Camera` in a linear fashion towards a new
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` and `Class.Camera.Focus` over a given duration, for
      example:

      ```lua

      camera:Interpolate(

      	CFrame.new(0, 0, 100),
      	5
      )
      ```

      Throughout the tween, the camera's `Class.Camera.CFrame` will be
      orientated towards the camera's `Class.Camera.Focus`.

      When the tween has completed, the camera's
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished` event will fire.

      If this function is called while the `Class.Camera` is already tweening
      the older tween will be stopped (without firing
      `Class.Camera.InterpolationFinished`) and overridden by the new tween.

      Interpolate can only be used if the current `Class.Camera.CameraType` is
      _'Scriptable'_, regardless of whether the default camera scripts are being
      used. If it is used with any other `Class.Camera.CameraType` an error will
      be thrown.

      You are advised to use `Class.TweenService` to tween the `Class.Camera`
      instead as it is more reliable and offers a variety of easing styles. See

      This function creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a 2D position on the

      This function is outdated and no longer considered best practice.

      This function sets the current roll, in radians, of the `Class.Camera`.
      The roll is applied after the `Class.Camera.CFrame` and represents the
      rotation around the camera's Z-axis.

      For example, the following would invert the `Class.Camera`:

      ```lua
      workspace.CurrentCamera:SetRoll(math.pi) -- math.pi radians = 180 degrees
      ```

      SetRoll has no effect on any roll applied using the `Class.Camera.CFrame`
      property. Roll applied using SetRoll is not reflected in the
      `Class.Camera.CFrame` property but is reflected in the `Datatype.CFrame`
      returned by`Class.Camera:GetRenderCFrame()`.

      This function can only be used when the `Class.Camera.CameraType` is set
      to _'Scriptable'_, regardless of whether the default camera scripts are
      being used. If it is used with any other `Class.Camera.CameraType` a
      warning is given in the output.

      Any roll applied using this function will be lost when the
      `Class.Camera.CameraType` is changed from _'Scriptable'_.

      To obtain the roll set using this function use `Class.Camera:GetRoll()`.

      As this function is outdated, you are advised to instead apply roll to the
      `Class.Camera` using the `Class.Camera.CFrame` property. For example:

    summary: |
      Creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a position on the viewport (in pixels),
      at a given depth from the `Class.Camera` orientated in the camera's
      direction. Does not account for the GUI inset.
    description: |
      This function creates a unit `Datatype.Ray` from a 2D position on the
      viewport (defined in pixels). This position does not account for the GUI
      inset. The `Datatype.Ray` originates from the `Datatype.Vector3`
      equivalent of the 2D position in the world at the given depth (in studs)
      away from the `Class.Camera`.

      As this function does not account for the GUI inset, the viewport position
      given is not equivalent to the screen position used by GUI elements. If
      you are not using `Class.ScreenGui.IgnoreGuiInset` and need an otherwise
      identical function that accounts for the GUI offset, use
      `Class.Camera:ScreenPointToRay()`.

      This function can be used in conjunction with the
      `Class.Camera.ViewportSize` property to create a ray from the centre of
      the screen, for example:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local viewportPoint = camera.ViewportSize / 2
      local unitRay = camera:ViewportPointToRay(viewportPoint.X, viewportPoint.Y, 0)
      ```

      As the `Datatype.Ray` created is a unit ray it is only one stud long. To
      create a longer ray, you can do the following:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local length = 500
      local unitRay = camera:ScreenPointToRay(100, 100)
      local ray = Ray.new(unitRay.Origin, unitRay.Direction * length)
      ```

      Returns the 2D screen location of a `Datatype.Vector3` position in the
      world, the depth of it from the screen and whether it is visible. Accounts
      for the GUI inset.
    description: |
      This function returns the screen location and depth of a
      `Datatype.Vector3` _worldPoint_ and whether this point is visible on the
      screen or not.

      ![In-game example](/assets/legacy/WorldToScreenPointImage.jpg)

      This function takes in account the current GUI inset (such as the space
      occupied by the top bar). This means the 2D position returned is in the
      same term as GUI positions and can be used to place GUI elements. For an
      otherwise identical function that ignores the GUI inset, see
      `Class.Camera:WorldToViewportPoint()`.

      For example:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local worldPoint = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local vector, onScreen = camera:WorldToScreenPoint(worldPoint)

      local screenPoint = Vector2.new(vector.X, vector.Y)
      local depth = vector.Z
      ```

      Note this function does not perform any raycasting, meaning the visible
      bool will be true regardless if the _worldPoint_ is obscured by
      `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` or `Class.Terrain`.

      ![In-game example](/assets/legacy/WorldToViewportPointImage.jpg)

      This function does not take in account the current GUI inset (such as the
      space occupied by the top bar). This means the 2D position returned is
      taken from the top left corner of the viewport. This means, unless you are
      using `Class.ScreenGui.IgnoreGuiInset` this position is not appropriate
      for placing GUI elements.

      For an otherwise identical function that accounts for the GUI inset, see
      `Class.Camera:WorldToScreenPoint()`.

      For example:

      ```lua
      local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
      local worldPoint = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
      local vector, inViewport = camera:WorldToViewportPoint(worldPoint)

      local viewportPoint = Vector2.new(vector.X, vector.Y)
      local depth = vector.Z
      ```

      Note this function does not perform any raycasting, meaning the visible
