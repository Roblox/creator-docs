  Bones are non-rendered objects that drive the movement of one or more parts
  for the purposes of animation, or creating clothing and characters. Bones are
  part of a `Class.Model` or `Class.MeshPart` object's skeletal **rig** that you
  typically access and animate through the
  [Animation Editor](../../../animation/editor.md).

  Rigs are created during the modeling process in third-party software such as
  Blender or Maya. After importing the rigged model into Studio, you can add the
  model directly to your experience, or save and share the model as an asset.
  See [Rigging](../../../art/modeling/rigging.md) for more details on creating
  and using rigged models.

  Note that you can parent `Class.Bone|Bones` under other `Class.Bone|Bones` and
  parts. When parenting a bone to another bone, the child bone's world position
  will be relative to the parent bone's position, and the hierarchy of parented
  `Class.Bone` objects can change the behavior of affected parts during posing
  or animation.

  ##### Relationship with Motor6D

  To support animations with older rigs using joints, such as `Class.Motor6D`,
  you can use the `Class.Bone.Transform` property in the same way as
  `Class.Motor6D.Transform`. Roblox uses the offset of the bones from the
  default pose to drive an animation, and bones are not replicated or
  serialized.

  ##### Bone.CFrame

  Bones inherit the `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame` property of
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments` which Roblox uses as the bone's reference
  position. The inherited `Class.Attachment.WorldCFrame|WorldCFrame` and other
  world properties return the initial un-transformed position.

      **Transform** determines the current animated offset of the bone relative
      to its `Class.Attachment.CFrame|CFrame`. This property is set by Roblox
      when animations on skinned meshes are played, although it can be
      manipulated manually in a manner similar to `Class.Motor6D.Transform`.

        character rig animation
      - `Class.Bone.TransformedCFrame|TransformedCFrame` and
        `Class.Bone.TransformedWorldCFrame|TransformedWorldCFrame`, whose values
        are partially determined by this property
