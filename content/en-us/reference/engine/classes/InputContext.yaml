  Collection of actions which holds related actions and defines how they

description: |
  An `InputContext` is a collection of actions which holds related
  `Class.InputAction|InputActions` and defines how they interact with other
  contexts and actions. Nested `InputContext` instances will have no effect and
  ordering/priority is managed through `Class.InputContext.Enabled|Enabled`,
  `Class.InputContext.Priority|Priority`, and `Class.InputContext.Sink|Sink`.

      Determines if this `InputContext` is enabled or not. When `false`, all of
      the descendant actions of the context do not receive any signals except
      when `Enabled` is toggled from `true` to `false`, in which case a final
      "end" signal is triggered if a key is pressed or a two-directional input
      is not zero.

      The priority level at which the context should be run (higher priority
      `InputContext` instances run before lower ones).

    summary: |
      Determines whether input bindings of lower priority will be processed.
    description: |
      When `Sink` is set to `true`, inputs will not be processed for connected
      `Class.InputAction` bindings within contexts of lower
      `Class.InputContext.Priority|Priority`. Contexts with the same priority
      will receive the input.

      For example, if multiple contexts contain an `Class.InputAction` with a
      binding to `Enum.KeyCode.E` and a higher priority context has `Sink` set
      to `true`, the lower priority contexts will not receive the input signal
      for `Enum.KeyCode.E` and will fire no events for it.
