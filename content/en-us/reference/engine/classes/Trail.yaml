  The Trail object is used to create a trail like an effect between two points.
  As the points move through space a texture is drawn on the plane the points
  define. This is commonly used to create effects to help visualize movements
  like tracer trails behind projectiles, footprints, tire tracks, and many other
  similar effects.

  See [Trails](../../../effects/trails.md) for more information.

    description: |
      A `Class.Trail` starts drawing its segments at the positions of its
      `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and **\*Attachment1**.

      When the Trail is `Class.Trail.Enabled` it will record the positions of
      its attachments every frame. It will connect these positions to the
      positions of the attachments on the previous frame. This creates a polygon
      that is then filled in by the Trail's `Class.Trail.Color` and
      `Class.Trail.Texture` (if that Texture exists).

      When created a Trail will not have any Attachments set by default. These
      will need to be set in order for the effect to work.

      Changing the Attachments of a Trail while a trail is drawing will remove
      all of the segments the trail has already drawn.

      The color of the trail segments throughout the lifetime of the trail.
    description: |
      The color of a `Class.Trail` can be set with the effect's Color property.
      This property determines what color the segments of the trail will have
      through their `Class.Trail.Lifetime`.

      Color is a `Datatype.ColorSequence`, which means that the segments in a
      trail can shift between several colors. Note that if the color for a trail
      changes after some of the trail segments have been drawn, all of the old
      segments will be updated to match the new colors.

      If a trail has a `Class.Trail.Texture` then the Color property will tint
      that texture.

      ![Trails with tinted textures](/assets/legacy/TrailTextureColor.png)

      Any transparent components of a texture will not be tinted.

    description: |
      This property determines whether the trail will be drawn or not. When
      `true`, the trail will create segments between the current position of its
      `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and the position of its attachments in the last
      frame. Defaults to `true`.

      If enabled is set to `false` while a trail is drawing, no new segments
      will be drawn, but any existing segments will be cleaned up naturally when
      they reach the end of their `Class.Trail.Lifetime`. To forcibly clean up
      any existing segments, use the `Class.Trail:Clear()` function at the same
      time.

      This property determines whether the `Class.Trail` is always drawn facing
      the camera. If set to `true`, the trail textures will always face the
      camera. If set to `false`, the texture will be drawn in the direction of
      the distance between the trail's `Class.Trail.Attachment0` and
      `Class.Trail.Attachment1`. The default value is `false`.

      Note that changing this property immediately affects all existing and
      future trail segments. This means that all existing and new segments will
      adjust to face the player's camera or the direction of the attachments
      according to the property's new state.

    summary: |
      Duration of the trail in seconds.
    description: |
      The Lifetime property determines how long each segment in its
      `Class.Trail` will last in seconds. Once a segment is drawn, it will wait
      for the given lifetime (measured in seconds) and then will disappear. The
      lifetime property defaults to 2 seconds, but can be set anywhere between
      0.01 and 20.

      The lifetime of a trail is also used by that effect's `Class.Trail.Color`
      and `Class.Trail.Transparency` properties to determine how each segment is
      drawn. Both of these properties are sequences, meaning that they define
      their values at certain keypoints in the segment's lifetime and then
      interpolate between the values as the segment ages.

      If a trail's lifetime changes while there are still segments that the
      trail has drawn, these segments will immediately behave as if they always
      had the new lifetime. This means that if they have existed for longer than
      the lifetime they will be removed immediately.

    description: |
      The LightEmission `Class.Trail` property sets how much the
      `Class.Trail.Color|Colors` of the trail are blended with the colors behind
      them. LightEmission uses additive blending to combine the colors, meaning
      the RGB values of the colors are added together to determine the displayed
      color. This addition is weighted by the value of LightEmission.

      When changed this property instantly affects all particles owned by the
      emitter, both current and future particles.

      This property is not related to the dynamic lighting engine of Roblox. If
      you need your trail to emit light, it is recommended to create parts with
      `Class.PointLight` that follow the path of the trail.

      **LightInfluence** determines the factor the light in the environment
      affects the appearance of the Trail. A value of zero (0) ensures no
      influence which allows a trail to be visible even in complete darkness.

      This property determines the maximum length of each of the segments in the
      trail. Note that changing it will only affect **new** segments that are
      drawn; any old segments that have already been drawn will maintain their
      current length.

      This value can be any number greater than or equal to 0, and it defaults
      to 0, meaning that the trail will not have a maximum length. Note that
      even if this property is 0 or another large number, the trail is still
      constrained by its `Class.Trail.Lifetime|Lifetime`. Old segments will be
      erased if they reach the end of their lifetime, even if the trail is
      shorter than the maximum length.

      This property can be used alongside the `Class.Trail.MinLength|MinLength`
      property which determines the minimum length trail must before it is
      drawn.

      trail. If neither of the trail's `Class.Trail.Attachment0` or
      `Class.Trail.Attachment1` have moved at least the minimum length in studs,
      no new segments will be created and the endpoints of the current segment
      will be moved to the current position of the attachments.

      Note that changing this property will only affect **new** segments that
      are drawn; any old segments that have already been drawn will maintain
      their current length.

      This value can be any number greater than or equal to 0 and it defaults to
      0.1.

      This property can be used alongside the `Class.Trail.MaxLength|MaxLength`
      property which determines the maximum length trail may be before its
      oldest segments are erased.

      based on the trail's `Class.Trail.TextureMode|TextureMode` and
      `Class.Trail.TextureLength|TextureLength` properties.

      If a texture is not provided, only the `Class.Trail.Color` of the trail
      will be used.

      If the TextureLength is changed after its trail has drawn some of its
      segments, the new length will only be applied to new segments being drawn
      -- old segments will be unaffected.

      Note that changing a trail's `Class.Trail.TextureMode|TextureMode` after

      value is a `Datatype.NumberSequence`, meaning it can be a static value or
      can change throughout the lifetime of the trail segments.

      The values in the NumberSequence can be any number, but the effective
      range of transparency is 0 (completely opaque) to 1 (completely

    description: |
      The WidthScale property is a `Datatype.NumberSequence` that scales the
      width of the `Class.Trail` over the course of its lifetime.

      This property can range from `0` to `1`. The value of the property
      influences the width of the trail by setting the trail's width to the
      product of:

          (distance between trail's attachment0 and attachment1 in studs) * (the value of WidthScale)

      For example, if the trail's attachments are 2 stud's apart, and the value
      of this property is 0.5, the trail's width will be 1 stud and the trail
      will be centered in between the two attachments.

      If you would like to hide the trail entirely, consider setting
      `Class.Trail.Enabled` to false.

      Clears the segments of the trail.
    description: |
      The Clear function clears the segments of the `Class.Trail`. This means
      that any trail that has been drawn will be erased when this function is
      called, even if that segment's `Class.Trail.Lifetime` duration has not yet
      been reached.

      While this is less noticeable for trails with shorter lifetimes, this is
      useful when cleaning up trails that have a longer lifetime, or for cases
      where the trail is removed when a certain game action occurs.

      Calling this function will only affect old segments that have already been
      done. It will not affect the drawing of any new trail segments after this
      function call. If you would like to clear existing trail segments, and
      temporarily prevent new segments from being drawn, consider toggling the
      trail's `Class.Trail.Enabled` property to false at the same time.
