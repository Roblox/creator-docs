  The DataModelMesh is an abstract class from which mesh classes descend.

  Mesh classes are objects that, when parented to `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`
  alter the appearance of the part to that of a predefined mesh. Note, they only
  alter the appearance of the part and not the physics/collision boundaries of
  the part. Developers looking to apply a mesh to a part that alters the part's
  collision should use `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`.

  Note the `Class.MeshPart` and `Class.CharacterMesh` classes do not descend
  from DataModelMesh.

  - name: DataModelMesh.Offset
    summary: |
      The Offset of a mesh determines the relative position from the
      `Class.BasePart.Position` of a `Class.BasePart` that the mesh will be
      displayed at.
    description: |
      The Offset of a mesh determines the distance from the
      `Class.BasePart.Position` of a `Class.BasePart` that the mesh will be
      displayed.

      #### How to use mesh offset

      The Offset property changes the relative position the mesh will be
      rendered at. For example, an offset of 0, 5, 0 will cause the mesh to be
      displayed 5 studs above the position of the `Class.BasePart`.

      The position of the `Class.BasePart` remains unchanged, meaning the
      physics collision box of the part will remain in the same location. This
      is demonstrated in the image below where the green outline (a
      `Class.SelectionBox`) shows the extents of the `Class.BasePart`.

      #### Other uses for mesh offset

      There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.

      - Offset and `Class.DataModelMesh.Scale` can be animated using
        `Class.TweenService` relatively inexpensively as the engine does not
        need to make any physics/collision calculations as the `Class.BasePart`
        is not moved.

      The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its
      original dimensions.

      The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its
      original dimensions.

      #### How to use mesh scale

      The scale property works slightly differently depending on the type of
      mesh being used. Note the size of the `Class.BasePart` remains unchanged,
      meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain the same.

      - `Class.SpecialMesh` objects with `Class.SpecialMesh.FileType` set to
        'FileMesh' scale relative to the original dimensions of the mesh when it
        was uploaded to Roblox
      - `Class.BlockMesh` objects or `Class.SpecialMesh` objects with
        `Class.SpecialMesh.FileType` set to 'Brick', 'Wedge' or 'Sphere' scale
        uniformly relative to the `Class.BasePart.Size` of their parent
      - `Class.CylinderMesh` objects or `Class.SpecialMesh` objects with
        `Class.SpecialMesh.FileType` set to 'Cylinder' scale relative to the
        `Class.BasePart.Size` of their parent. Uniformly for the cylinders
        height axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the length and width of the
        cylinder, using the lowest value.
      - `Class.SpecialMesh` objects with `Class.SpecialMesh.FileType` set to
        'Head' currently scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not
        rely on this as there are plans to change this behavior.
      - `Class.SpecialMesh` objects with `Class.SpecialMesh.FileType` set to
        'Torso' scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on
        this as there are plans to deprecate this mesh type.

      #### Mesh scale demonstration

      The above behavior can be seen in the following demonstration images.

      Linear scaling relative to part size for 'Brick', 'Wedge' and 'Sphere'
      meshes.

      Linear scaling relative to original uploaded mesh for 'FileMesh' meshes

      Non-uniform constrained scaling for 'Cylinder' meshes

      #### Other uses for mesh scale

      There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.

      - `Class.DataModelMesh.Offset` and Scale can be animated using
        `Class.TweenService` relatively inexpensively as the engine does not
        need to make any physics/collision calculations as the `Class.BasePart`
        is not changed.

      Changes the hue of a mesh's texture, used with `Class.FileMesh.TextureId`.
    description: |
      **VertexColor** determines the hue change of the
      `Class.FileMesh.TextureId|Texture` of a `Class.FileMesh`. Note that this
      property is a `Datatype.Vector3` rather than a `Datatype.Color3`; to
      convert, use the `Datatype.Color3.R`, `Datatype.Color3.G`, and
      `Datatype.Color3.B` properties.

      Although this property allows basic modification of a texture, changing a
      texture entirely provides more control. See `Class.MeshPart` for more
      details.
