description: |
  **VRService** is responsible for handling interactions between Roblox and
  Virtual Reality (VR). Its methods, properties, and events help you provide the
  best experience for end users seeking to experience Roblox on VR devices.

  Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a
  `Class.LocalScript` or a `Class.Script` with
  `Class.Script.RunContext|RunContext` of `Enum.RunContext|Client`.

  See [VR Guidelines](../../../production/publishing/vr-guidelines.md) for more
  information on publishing an experience for VR devices.

      When `Class.VRService.AutomaticScaling` is set to `World`,
      `Class.Camera.HeadScale` adjusts so that the scale of the world is seen
      from the avatar's perspective. A player with a small avatar will perceive
      the objects around them as larger than a player with a large avatar will.

      The GuiInputUserCFrame property describes what `Enum.UserCFrame` is
      responsible for input in VR. For instance, if a VR headset is responsible,
      the value of this property will be UserCFrame.Head.

      To check if Roblox detects any VR devices, which would be responsible for
      input in VR, you can check the `Class.VRService.VREnabled` property.

      Since `Class.VRService` only runs client-side, this property will only
      work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      This property describes whether the user is using a virtual reality (VR)
      device.

      If a VR device is enabled, you can interact with its location and movement
      through functions such as `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()`. You
      can also react to VR device movement using the
      `Class.UserInputService.UserCFrameChanged` event.

      ```lua
      local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local isUsingVR = userInputService.VREnabled
      if isUsingVR then
          print("User is using a VR headset!")
      else
          print("User is not using a VR headset!")
      end
      ```

      As `Class.UserInputService` is client-side only, this property can only be
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      The GetTouchpadMode function returns the `Enum.VRTouchpadMode` indicating
      the mode of a specified `Enum.VRTouchpad`.

      The returned mode indicates how the user interacts with their touchpad to
      play the game. For more information about the different types of modes,
      see the `Enum.VRTouchpadMode` page.

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      functions and events.

      Since `Class.VRService` only runs client-side, this function will only

    summary: |
      Returns a CFrame describing the position &amp; orientation of a specified
      virtual reality device as an offset from a point in real world space.
    description: |
      The GetUserCFrame function returns a `Datatype.CFrame` describing the
      position &amp; orientation of a specified virtual reality (VR) device as
      an offset from a point in real world space.

      This function should be used when implementing VR compatibility into a
      game to obtain and track the movement of a connected VR device.

      By using the function, players can implement features such as
      re-positioning the user's in-game character corresponding to the location
      of a connected VR device. This can be done by changing the _CFrame_ of the
      user's in-game character to match the _CFrame_ of the specified VR device
      using the UserCFrame enum and _CFrame_ value arguments passed by the
      event.

      The `Class.VRService` service also provides an event
      `Class.VRService.UserCFrameChanged` that automatically fires when the
      _CFrame_ of connected VR device changes - so long it is used in a
      LocalScript.

      Since `Class.VRService` only runs client-side, this function will only
      work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      The GetUserCFrameEnabled function returns true if the specified
      `Enum.UserCFrame` virtual reality device (VR) is available to be listened
      to.

      This can be used to determine whether a specified VR device, _(e.g.
      UserCFrame.Head)_, is connected to the user's game. If the specified VR
      device is connected, is it enabled (_true_). Otherwise, it is disabled
      (_false_).

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      functions and events.

    description: |
      The RecentUserHeadCFrame function recenters the `Datatype.CFrame` of the
      user's head to the current location of the VR headset being worn by the
      user.

      This function can be used to ensure that the user's in-game head is
      positioned according to the location of the user's VR headset.

      This behaves identically to the `Class.UserInputService` function,
      `Class.UserInputService:RecenterUserHeadCFrame()`.

      Since `VRServiceService` only runs client-side, this function will only
      work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      The RequestNavigation function requests navigation to the specified
      `Datatype.CFrame`, using the specified `Enum.UserCFrame` as the origin for
      the visualizer parabola.

      This can be used to incorporate virtual reality (VR) into your game by
      providing a means to visualize a navigation path from the user's VR device
      to a destination.

      The `Class.VRService` has a similar event,
      `Class.VRService.NavigationRequested`, used to detect such requests. This
      can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      functions and events.

      Since VRService only runs client-side, this function will only work when
      used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      The SetTouchpadMode function sets the mode of the specified
      `Enum.VRTouchpad` to the specified `Enum.VRTouchpadMode`.

      This can be used to change the user's virtual reality (VR) touchpad mode
      so that the user interacts with the game different using the touchpad. For
      more information about the different types of modes, see the
      `Enum.VRTouchpadMode` page.

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      functions and events.

      This is fired with a `Datatype.CFrame` coordinate and specified UserCFrame

      This `Class.VRService` event can be used alongside

      changes, and its new state.

      You can use this event to track the states of VRTouchpads connected via

      This `Class.VRService` event can be used alongside
