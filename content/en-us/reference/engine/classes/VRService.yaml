      Automatically adjusts scaling in VR to align the player with their avatar.
    description: |
      When set to `Enum.VRScaling.World`, `Class.Camera.HeadScale` adjusts so
      that the scale of the world is seen from the avatar's perspective. A
      player with a small avatar will perceive the objects around them as larger
      than a player with a large avatar will.

      property will be `Enum.UserCFrame.Head`.

      To check if Roblox detects any VR devices, which would be responsible for
      input in VR, you can check the `Class.VRService.VREnabled|VREnabled`

      This property describes whether the user is using a virtual reality (VR)
      device.

      If a VR device is enabled, you can interact with its location and movement
      through methods such as `Class.UserInputService:GetUserCFrame()`. You can
      also react to VR device movement using the
      `Class.UserInputService.UserCFrameChanged` event.

      ```lua
      local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

      local isUsingVR = UserInputService.VREnabled
      if isUsingVR then
      	print("User is using a VR headset!")
      else
      	print("User is not using a VR headset!")
      end
      ```

      This property can only be used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

    description: |
      This method returns the `Enum.VRTouchpadMode` indicating the mode of a
      specified `Enum.VRTouchpad`. The returned mode indicates how the user
      interacts with their touchpad to play the game.

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      methods and events.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

  - name: VRService:GetUserCFrame
    summary: |
      Returns a CFrame describing the position &amp; orientation of a specified
      virtual reality device as an offset from a point in real world space.
    description: |
      This method returns a `Datatype.CFrame` describing the position and
      orientation of a specified virtual reality (VR) device as an offset from a
      point in real world space. This method should be used when implementing VR
      compatibility into a game to obtain and track the movement of a connected
      VR device.

      By using the method, developers can implement features such as
      re-positioning the user's in-game character corresponding to the location
      of a connected VR device. This can be done by changing the _CFrame_ of the
      user's in-game character to match the _CFrame_ of the specified VR device
      using the UserCFrame enum and _CFrame_ value arguments passed by the
      event.

      `Class.VRService` also provides a
      `Class.VRService.UserCFrameChanged|UserCFrameChanged` event that
      automatically fires when the `Datatype.CFrame` of connected VR device
      changes, so long it is used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.
    code_samples:
      - VRService-GetUserCFrame
    parameters:
      - name: type
        type: UserCFrame
        default:

    summary: |
      Returns true if the specified `Enum.UserCFrame` is available to be
      listened to.
    description: |
      This method returns true if the specified `Enum.UserCFrame` virtual
      reality device (VR) is available to be listened to. It can be used to
      determine whether a specified VR device, such as `Enum.UserCFrame.Head`,
      is connected to the user's game.

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      methods and events.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.
    code_samples:
      - VRService-GetUserCFrameEnabled

      - name: type
        type: UserCFrame

    returns:
      - type: boolean

          A boolean indicating whether the specified VR device is enabled
          (`true`) or disabled (`false`).

    summary: |
      Re-centers the `Datatype.CFrame` to the current location of the VR headset
      being worn by the user.
    description: |
      This method re-centers the `Datatype.CFrame` of the user's head to the
      current location of the VR headset being worn by the user. It can be used
      to ensure that the user's in-game head is positioned according to the
      location of the user's VR headset.

      This behaves identically to
      `Class.UserInputService:RecenterUserHeadCFrame()`.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.

      - VRService-RecenterUserHeadCFrame

    description: |
      This method requests navigation to the specified `Datatype.CFrame` using
      the specified `Enum.UserCFrame` as the origin for the visualizer parabola.
      It can be used to incorporate virtual reality (VR) into your game by
      providing a means to visualize a navigation path from the user's VR device
      to a destination.

      `Class.VRService` has a similar event,
      `Class.VRService.NavigationRequested|NavigationRequested`, used to detect
      such requests. This can also be used alongside the several
      `Class.UserInputService` VR methods and events.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.
    code_samples:

    description: |
      This method sets the mode of the specified `Enum.VRTouchpad` to the
      specified `Enum.VRTouchpadMode`. It can be used to change the user's
      virtual reality (VR) touchpad mode so that the user interacts with the
      game differently using the touchpad.

      This can also be used alongside the several `Class.UserInputService` VR
      methods and events.

      This method will only work when used in a `Class.LocalScript`.
