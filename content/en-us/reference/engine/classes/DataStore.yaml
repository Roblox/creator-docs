      through `Class.DataStore:ListVersionsAsync()` or alternatively be the
      identifier returned by `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()`.

          Key name for which the version info is requested. If
          `Class.DataStoreOptions.AllScopes` was set to true when accessing the
          data store through `Class.DataStoreService:GetDataStore()`, this key
          name must be prepended with the original scope as in "scope/key".
      - name: version
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          Version number of the key for which the version info is requested.
    returns:
      - type: Tuple
        summary: |
          The value of the key at the specified version and a
          `Class.DataStoreKeyInfo` instance that includes the version number,
          date and time the version was created, and functions to retrieve
          `Class.Player.UserId|UserIds` and metadata.

      Returns a `Class.DataStoreKeyPages` object for enumerating through keys of

    description: |
      This function returns a `Class.DataStoreKeyPages` object for enumerating
      through keys of a data store. It accepts an optional `prefix` parameter to
      only locate keys whose names start with the provided prefix.

      If `Class.DataStoreOptions.AllScopes` was set to true when accessing the
      data store through `Class.DataStoreService:GetDataStore()`, keys will be
      returned with all scopes as prefixes.

      - name: prefix

          **(Optional)** Prefix to use for locating keys.
      - name: pageSize
        type: int
        default: 0
        summary: |
          **(Optional)** Number of items to be returned in each page. If no
          value is given, the engine sends a default value of 0 to the data
          store web service, which in turn defaults to 50 items per page.
      - name: cursor
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          **(Optional)** Cursor to continue iteration.
      - name: excludeDeleted
        type: boolean
        default: false
        summary: |
          **(Optional)** Exclude deleted keys from being returned.

          When enabled ListKeys will check up to 512 keys. If all checked keys
          are deleted then it will return an empty list with a cursor to
          continue iteration.
    returns:
      - type: DataStoreKeyPages
        summary: |
          A `Class.DataStoreKeyPages` instance that enumerates the keys as

      Enumerates all versions of a key.
    description: |
      This function enumerates versions of the specified key in either ascending
      or descending order specified by a `Enum.SortDirection` parameter. It can
      optionally filter the returned versions by minimum and maximum timestamp.

      This function permanently deletes the specified version of a key. Version
      identifiers can be found through `Class.DataStore:ListVersionsAsync()`.

      Unlike `Class.GlobalDataStore:RemoveAsync()`, this function does not
      create a new "tombstone" version and the removed value cannot be retrieved
