  A TextButton behaves similarly to `Class.TextLabel` in regards to rendering
  with the additional behaviors of a `Class.GuiButton`. It defines the same
  text-rendering properties as a `Class.TextLabel` does.

  You can disable text rendering by setting `Class.TextButton.TextTransparency`
  to 1. This will leave you with a plain rectangle that can be used as a button.

      A copy of `Class.TextButton.Text` that contains exactly what is being
      rendered by the `Class.TextButton`.
    description: |
      This property provides a copy of `Class.TextButton.Text` that contains
      exactly what is being rendered by the `Class.TextButton`. This is useful
      for eliminating style tags used for rich text.

      #### Example

      When `Class.TextButton.RichText` is enabled, the
      `Class.TextButton.ContentText` property shows the text as it appears to
      the player.

      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>RichText</th>
                  <th>Text</th>
                  <th>ContentText</th>

      The Font property selects one of several pre-defined fonts with which the
      UI element will render its text. Some fonts have bold, italic and/or light
      variants (as there is no font-weight or font-style properties).

      With the exception of the "Legacy" font, each font will render text with
      the line height equal to the `Class.TextButton.TextSize` property. The
      "Code" font is the only monospace font. It has the unique property that
      each character has the exact same width and height ratio of 1:2. The width
      of each character is approximately half the `Class.TextButton.TextSize`
      property.

      This property is kept in sync with the `Class.TextButton.FontFace`
      property. When setting Font, the FontFace is set to
      `Datatype.Font.fromEnum(value)`.

      Changes whether text is resized to fit within the TextButton.
    description: |
      Rather than using TextScaled, we recommend you consider using
      `Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize`, a new method to dynamically
      size UI that will give you the best visual result possible.

      The TextScaled property determines whether text is scaled so that it fills
      the entire UI element's space. When this is enabled,
      `Class.TextButton.TextSize` is ignored and `Class.TextButton.TextWrapped`
      is automatically enabled. This property is useful for text-rendering UI
      elements within `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`.

      When this property is used for screen-space UI, it may be desirable to use
      a `Class.UITextSizeConstraint` to restrict the range of possible text
      sizes.

      #### TextScaled and AutomaticSize

      It's recommended that developers avoid usage of TextScaled and adjust UI
      to take advantage of the AutomaticSize property instead. Here are the core
      differences between the two properties:

      - TextScaled scales the content (text) to accommodate the UI. Without
        careful consideration, some text may become unreadable if scaled too
        small.
      - AutomaticSize resizes the UI to accommodate content.

      With AutomaticSize, you're able to adjust your UI to accommodate the
      content (text) while maintaining a consistent font size. For more
      information on how to use automatic sizing, see the UI Automatic Size
      article.

      We suggest that you don't apply both TextScaled and AutomaticSize on the
      same UI object. If you apply both properties:

      - AutomaticSize determines the maximum amount of available space that a
        `Class.GuiObject` can use (in this case, text)
      - TextScaled uses the available space determined by AutomaticSize, to
        scale the font size to fit the available space, which will expand up to
        the maximum font size (100), if there are no size constraints
      - The end result will be: text goes to 100 font size and the UI object
        will expand to fit that text

      Using both AutomaticSize and TextScaled at the same time can result in
      significant scaling differences than when AutomaticSize is off.

      The TextStrokeColor3 property sets the color of the stroke, or outline, of

      Text stroke is rendered before normal text and is simply 4 renderings of
      the same text in +/- 1 pixel offsets in each direction. Text stroke

      rendering works independently and identically to

      Since text stroke is simply multiple renderings of the same transparency,
      this property is essentially multiplicative on itself four times over
      (e.g. a TextStrokeTransparency of 0.5 appears about the same as
      TextTransparency of 0.0625, or 0.5^4). Therefore, it's recommended to set
      TextStrokeTransparency to a value in the range of 0.75 to 1 for more a
      more subtle effect.

      text-align property, with left, right and center values (there is no
      justify option). For Left and Right, text is rendered such that the
      left/right text bounds just touch the edge of the UI element rectangle.
      For Center, each line of text is centered on the very center of the UI
      element rectangle.

      This property is used in conjunction with
      `Class.TextButton.TextYAlignment` to fully determine text alignment on
      both axes. This property won't affect the read-only properties
      `Class.TextButton.TextBounds` and `Class.TextButton.TextFits`.

      Determines the vertical alignment of rendered text.
    description: |
      TextYAlignment determines the vertical alignment (Y-axis) of text rendered
      within a UI element's space. For Top and Bottom, text is rendered such
      that the top/bottom text bounds just touch the edge of the UI element
      rectangle. For Center, text is rendered such that there is an equal space
      from the top bounds of the text to the top of the element and the bottom
      bounds of the text to the bottom of the element.
