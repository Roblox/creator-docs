name: StringValue
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  A container object for a single string.
description: |
  Stores a single [Luau string](https://luau.org/syntax#string-literals). The
  length of the string can't be more than 200,000 characters; anything longer
  causes a `String too long` error.

  If the string is too long to be displayed in the **Value** field within the
  **Properties** window, it shows partial string contents and an ellipsis (...).

  Like all `Class.ValueBase` objects, this single value is stored in the
  `Class.StringValue.Value|Value` property. The `Changed` event fires with the
  new value being stored in the object, instead of a string representing the
  property being changed.

      Fires whenever `Class.StringValue.Value` is changed.
    description: |
      Fires whenever the `Class.IntValue.Value` changes. It runs with the new
      value being stored in the argument object, instead of a string
      representing the property being changed.

      Listening for the `Changed` signal can be useful in games that use
      `StringValues` to track values like NPC names or item descriptions.
