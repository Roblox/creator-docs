  Links a `Class.DataModel` instance to a corresponding asset in the cloud.
description: |
  The purpose of the `Class.PackageLink` object is to link a `Class.DataModel`
  instance to a corresponding asset in the cloud. This improves flows for
  collaboration, version control, and sharing for models. The `Class.PackageLink`
  instance will be a child of the root of the entire package hierarchy.

  `Class.PackageLink|PackageLinks` are not creatable through `Class.Script|Scripts`.
  They can only be added through interaction with Studio and can only be parented to
  `Class.Instance|Instances` that can be published independently of `Class.DataModel`
  publish. The `Class.PackageLink` instance will always be the first child shown in
  the tree view, regardless of sorting.
