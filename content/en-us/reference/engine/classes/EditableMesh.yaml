type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Instance which allows for the runtime creation and manipulation of meshes.
description: |
  `EditableMesh` changes the applied visual mesh when linked to a
  `Class.MeshPart`, allowing for querying and modification of the mesh both in
  Studio and in experience.

  #### Enabling for Published Experiences

  For security purposes, using `EditableMesh` fails by default for published
  experiences. To enable usage of `EditableMesh`, you must be 13+ age verified
  and ID verified. After you are verified, open Studio's
  [Experience Settings](../../../studio/experience-settings.md), select
  **Security**, and enable the **Allow&nbsp;Mesh&nbsp;&&nbsp;Image&nbsp;APIs**
  toggle. Remember to review the
  [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use#creators-restrictions-on-use)
  before enabling the toggle.

  #### Permissions

  To prevent misuse, `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync()` will only
  allow you to load and edit mesh assets:

  - That are owned by the creator of the experience (if the experience is owned
    by an individual).
  - That are owned by a group (if the experience is owned by the group).
  - That are owned by the logged in Studio user (if the place file has not yet
    been saved or published to Roblox).

  #### Memory Limits

  Editable assets are currently expensive for memory usage. To minimize its
  impact on client performance, `EditableMesh` has strict client-side memory
  budgets, although the server, Studio, and plugins operate with unlimited
  memory. Using `Class.EditableMesh.FixedSize|FixedSize` may help you stay
  within the memory budget and, in some scenarios, linking one `EditableMesh` to
  multiple `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts` (multi-referencing) can help with memory
  optimization.

  #### Creation and Display

  An `EditableMesh` can be created from an existing `Datatype.Content` of a
  `Class.MeshPart` or a mesh ID using
  `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync()`, or a blank `EditableMesh` can
  be created with `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMesh()`. It can then be
  displayed, modified, and its collision model updated. Not all of the steps are
  necessary; for example, you might want to create an `EditableMesh` just to
  raycast without ever displaying it.

  ```lua
  local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")

  -- Create empty EditableMesh
  local editableMesh = AssetService:CreateEditableMesh()

  -- Create EditableMesh from asset ID
  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	editableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSET_ID))
  end)

  -- Create EditableMesh from another EditableMesh
  local editableMeshFromAnother = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	editableMeshFromAnother = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromObject(OTHER_EDITABLE_MESH))
  end)

  -- Create EditableMesh from MeshPart
  local editableMeshFromMeshPart = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	editableMeshFromMeshPart = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(MESH_PART.MeshContent)
  end)
  ```

  An `EditableMesh` is displayed when it's linked to a new `Class.MeshPart`,
  through `Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync()`. You can create more
  `Class.MeshPart` instances that reference the same `EditableMesh`
  `Datatype.Content`, or link to an existing `Class.MeshPart` through
  `Class.MeshPart:ApplyMesh()`.

  ```lua
  local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")
  local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

  -- Create EditableMesh from asset ID
  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	editableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSET_ID))
  end)

  -- Create new MeshPart linked to the EditableMesh
  local newMeshPart = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	newMeshPart = AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync(Content.fromObject(editableMeshFromAsset))
  end)

  -- Alternatively, link the new MeshPart created above to an existing MeshPart
  local existingMeshPart = Workspace:FindFirstChild("EXISTING_MESH_PART")
  existingMeshPart:ApplyMesh(newMeshPart)
  ```

  To recalculate collision and fluid geometry after editing, you can again call
  `Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync()` and `Class.MeshPart:ApplyMesh()` to
  update an existing `Class.MeshPart`. It's generally recommended to do this at
  the end of a conceptual edit, not after individual calls to methods that
  manipulate geometry. Visual changes to the mesh will always be immediately
  reflected by the engine, without the need to call
  `Class.AssetService:CreateMeshPartAsync()`.

  #### Fixed-Size Meshes

  When creating an `EditableMesh` from an existing mesh asset (via
  `Class.AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync()`), the resulting editable mesh
  is fixed-size by default. Fixed-size meshes are more efficient in terms of
  memory but you cannot change the number of vertices, faces, or attributes.
  Only the values of vertex attributes and positions can be edited.

  ```lua
  local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")

  -- Create EditableMesh without fixed-size default
  local editableMeshFromAsset = nil
  local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
  	editableMeshFromAsset = AssetService:CreateEditableMeshAsync(Content.fromAssetId(ASSET_ID), {FixedSize = false})
  end)
  ```

  #### Stable Vertex/Face IDs

  Many `EditableMesh` methods take **vertex**, **normal**, **UV**, **color** and
  **face** IDs. These are represented as integers in Luau but they require some
  special handling. The main difference is that IDs are stable and they remain
  the same even if other parts of the mesh change. For example, if an
  `EditableMesh` has five vertices `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and you remove vertex `4`,
  the new vertices will be `{1, 2, 3, 5}`.

  Note that the IDs are not guaranteed to be in order and there may be holes in
  the numbering, so when iterating through vertices or faces, you should iterate
  through the table returned by `Class.EditableMesh:GetVertices()|GetVertices()`
  or `Class.EditableMesh:GetFaces()|GetFaces()`.

  #### Split Vertex Attributes

  A **vertex** is a corner of a face, and topologically connects faces together.
  Vertices can have several attributes: position, normal, UV coordinate, color,
  and transparency.

  Sometimes it's useful for all faces that touch a vertex to use the same
  attribute values, but sometimes you'll want different faces to use different
  attribute values on the same vertex. For example, on a smooth sphere, each
  vertex will only have a single normal. In contrast, at the corner of a cube,
  the vertex will have 3 different normals (one for each adjacent face). You can
  also have seams in the UV coordinates or sharp changes in the vertex colors.

  When creating faces, every vertex will by default have one of each attribute:
  one normal, one UV coordinate, and one color/transparency. If you want to
  create a seam, you should create new attributes and set them on the face. For
  example, this code will create a sharp cube:

  ```lua
  local AssetService = game:GetService("AssetService")

  -- Given 4 vertex IDs, adds a new normal and 2 triangles, making a sharp quad
  local function addSharpQuad(editableMesh, vid0, vid1, vid2, vid3)
  	local nid = editableMesh:AddNormal()  -- This creates a normal ID which is automatically computed

  	local fid1 = editableMesh:AddTriangle(vid0, vid1, vid2)
  	editableMesh:SetFaceNormals(fid1, {nid, nid, nid})

  	local fid2 = editableMesh:AddTriangle(vid0, vid2, vid3)
  	editableMesh:SetFaceNormals(fid2, {nid, nid, nid})
  end

  -- Makes a cube with creased edges between the 6 sides
  local function makeSharpCube()
  	local editableMesh = AssetService:CreateEditableMesh()

  	local v1 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 0, 0))
  	local v2 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 0, 0))
  	local v3 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 1, 0))
  	local v4 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 1, 0))
  	local v5 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 0, 1))
  	local v6 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 0, 1))
  	local v7 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(0, 1, 1))
  	local v8 = editableMesh:AddVertex(Vector3.new(1, 1, 1))

  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v5, v6, v8, v7)  -- Front
  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v3, v4, v2)  -- Back
  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v5, v7, v3)  -- Left
  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v2, v4, v8, v6)  -- Right
  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v1, v2, v6, v5)  -- Bottom
  	addSharpQuad(editableMesh, v3, v7, v8, v4)  -- Top

  	editableMesh:RemoveUnused()
  	return editableMesh
  end
  ```

  #### Winding

  Mesh faces have a front side and a back side. When drawing meshes, only the
  front of the faces are drawn by default, although you can change this by
  setting the mesh' `Class.MeshPart.DoubleSided|DoubleSided` property to `true`.

  The order of the vertices around the face determines whether you are looking
  at the front or the back. The front of the face is visible when the vertices
  go counterclockwise around it.

  <img src="../../../assets/engine-api/classes/EditableMesh/Winding.png" alt="Order of the vertices around the face" width="550" />

  #### FACS Poses

  Animatable heads use the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). See the
  [FACS poses reference](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/facs-poses-reference.md)
  for helpful information when using
  `Class.EditableMesh:GetFacsPoses()|GetFacsPoses()` and similar methods.

  Each FACS pose is specified by an `Enum.FacsActionUnit` value. For the FACS
  pose, virtual bones can each have a `Datatype.CFrame` that transforms the
  bones' initial `Datatype.CFrame` in the bind pose of the mesh into the
  `Datatype.CFrame` for that FACS action unit's pose. All bone
  `Datatype.CFrame|CFrames` are in the mesh's local space.

  These FACS poses are blended together during animation. Sometimes, the
  blending of the base poses produces poor results. In those cases, you can
  override the blending of specific combinations of base poses with a
  [corrective pose](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/create-basic-heads.md#combination-poses)
  that is more pleasing. A corrective pose is specified by 2 or 3
  `Enum.FacsActionUnit` values. Like a base FACS pose, for a corrective pose,
  virtual bones can each have a `Datatype.CFrame` that transforms the bones'
  initial `Datatype.CFrame` in the bind pose of the mesh into the
  `Datatype.CFrame` for that FACS corrective.

  Please note that corrective poses that operate on both left and right action
  units are not currently expressible. For example, using `LeftCheekPuff` and
  `RightEyeClosed` together in a corrective pose is not currently possible.

  #### Limitations

  `EditableMesh` currently has a limit of 60,000 vertices and 20,000 triangles.
  Attempting to add too many vertices or triangles will cause an error.

      Casts a ray and returns a point of intersection, face ID, and barycentric

      A **barycentric coordinate** is a way of specifying a point within a face
      as a weighted combination of the 3 vertices of the face. This is useful as
      a general way of blending vertex attributes. See this method's code sample
