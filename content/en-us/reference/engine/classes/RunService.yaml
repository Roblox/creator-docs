type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Service responsible for all runtime activity and progression of time.
description: |
  `RunService` contains methods and events for time management as well as for
  managing the context in which an experience or script is running. Methods like
  `Class.RunService:IsClient()|IsClient()`,
  `Class.RunService:IsServer()|IsServer()`, and
  `Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio()` can help you determine under what
  context code is running. These methods are useful for
  `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` that may be required by both client and
  server scripts. Furthermore, `Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio()` can be
  used to add special behaviors for in‑Studio testing.

  `RunService` also houses events that allow your code to adhere to Roblox's
  frame‑by‑frame loop, such as `Class.RunService.PreRender|PreRender`,
  `Class.RunService.PreAnimation|PreAnimation`,
  `Class.RunService.PreSimulation|PreSimulation`,
  `Class.RunService.PostSimulation|PostSimulation`, and
  `Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat`. Selecting the proper event to use for
  any case is important, so you should read
  [Task Scheduler](../../../performance-optimization/microprofiler/task-scheduler.md#runservice) to make an
  informed decision.

methods:
  - name: RunService:BindToRenderStep
    summary: |
      Given a string name of a function and a priority, this method binds the
      function to `Class.RunService.PreRender`.
    description: |
      The `BindToRenderStep()` function binds a custom function to be called at
      a specific time during the render step. There are three main arguments:
      `name`, `priority`, and what `function` to call.

      As it is linked to the client's rendering process, `BindToRenderStep()`
      can only be called on the client.

      ##### Name

      The `name` parameter is a label for the binding and can be used with
      `Class.RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep()` if the binding is no longer
      needed.

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local function functionToBind() end

      -- Bind the function above to the binding named "tempBinding"
      RunService:BindToRenderStep("tempBinding", 1, functionToBind)
      -- Unbind the function bound to "tempBinding"
      RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep("tempBinding")
      ```

      ##### Priority

      The `priority` of the binding is an integer; it determines when during the
      render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the sooner
      the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same
      priority, the Roblox Engine will randomly pick one to run first. The
      default Roblox control scripts run with these specific priorities:

      - Player Input: `100`
      - Camera Controls: `200` For convenience; the `Enum.RenderPriority` enum
        can be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For
        example, to make a binding right before the default camera update,
        simply subtract `1` from the camera priority level.

      When using `Enum.RenderPriority`, remember to use `.Value` at the end of
      the desired enum. `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()` will not work if
      just the enum is used on its own.

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local function beforeCamera(delta)
      	-- Code in here will run before the default Roblox camera script
      end

      RunService:BindToRenderStep("Before camera", Enum.RenderPriority.Camera.Value - 1, beforeCamera)
      ```

      ##### Custom Function and Delta Time

      The last argument (`function`) is the custom function to call. This
      function will be passed one parameter called `deltaTime` which shows how
      much time passed between the beginning of the previous render step and the
      beginning of the current render step.

      All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step
      finishes. Make sure that any code called by `BindToRenderStep()` runs
      quickly and efficiently; if code takes too long, the experience visuals
      will be choppy.

    description: |
      The `Heartbeat` event fires every frame, after the physics simulation has
      completed. The `deltaTime` argument indicates the time that has elapsed
      since the previous frame.

      This event is when most scripts run. It occurs at the end of each frame
      and it's also when any waiting scripts are executed, such as those
      scheduled with the `Library.task` library. `Heartbeat` is commonly used
      for periodic tasks, such as updating core game systems like health
      regeneration.

      Following this step, the engine sends property updates and events to the
      server or clients which are later received as part of the
      [replication](../../../projects/client-server.md#replication) receive
      step.

      The `PostSimulation` event fires every frame, after the physics simulation

      current frame has stepped the physics simulation, not accounting for
      physics throttling. This may deviate from the actual time between frames
      in Studio edit mode or when framerate is very low.

      This event is useful for making final adjustments to the outcome of the
      simulation. Following this phase, the engine triggers the
      `Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat` event.

      The `PreAnimation` event fires every frame, prior to the physics

      time that the current frame has stepped animations.

      This event is useful for modifying animation objects, such as adjusting
      their speed or priority. Once the `PreAnimation` event is complete, the
      engine proceeds to run these animations, updating the joint transforms
      which will later be used to update objects during the physics simulation.

      After animations are stepped, the engine triggers the
      `Class.RunService.PreSimulation|PreSimulation` event.

      Fires every frame, prior to the frame being rendered.
    description: |
      The `PreRender` event (replacement for
      `Class.RunService.RenderStepped|RenderStepped`) fires every frame, prior
      to the frame being rendered. The `deltaTimeRender` argument indicates the
      time that has elapsed since the previous frame.

      This event allows you to run code and update the world before it's drawn
      on a player's screen. This is useful for last‑minute adjustments such as
      changing object positions, updating animations, or preparing visual
      effects, but it should be used sparingly as the engine cannot start to
      render the frame until code running in this event has finished executing.

      As `PreRender` is client-side, it can only be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript`, in a `Class.ModuleScript` required by a
      `Class.LocalScript`, or in a `Class.Script` with
      `Class.BaseScript.RunContext|RunContext` set to `Enum.RunContext.Client`.

      Following the `PreRender` phase, the simulation phase begins with the
      `Class.RunService.PreAnimation|PreAnimation` event.

      The `PreSimulation` event (replacement for
      `Class.RunService.Stepped|Stepped`) fires every frame, prior to the
      physics simulation. The `deltaTimeSim` argument indicates the time that
      the current frame will step the physics simulation, not accounting for
      physics throttling. This may deviate from the actual time between frames
      in Studio edit mode or when framerate is very low.

      This event is useful for adjusting properties like velocity or forces just
      before they're applied as part of the simulation. The simulation then
      runs, potentially multiple times, as the physics solver runs at a higher
      frequency than other engine systems. Once this is complete, the
      `Class.RunService.PostSimulation|PostSimulation` event is fired.

      ##### Migration Note

      This event has been superseded by `Class.RunService.PreRender|PreRender`
      which should be used for new work.
