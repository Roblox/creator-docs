  Game service responsible for all run-time activity and progression of time.

  **RunService** contains methods and events for time-management as well as for
  managing the context in which a game or script is running. Methods like
  `Class.RunService:IsClient()|IsClient`,
  `Class.RunService:IsServer()|IsServer`,
  `Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio`, can help you determine under what
  context code is running. These methods are useful for ModuleScripts that may
  be required by both client and server scripts. Furthermore,
  `Class.RunService:IsStudio()|IsStudio` can be used to add special behaviors
  for in-studio testing.

  RunService also houses events that allow your code to adhere to Roblox's
  frame-by-frame loop, such as `Class.RunService.PreAnimation|PreAnimation`,
  `Class.RunService.PreSimulation|PreSimulation`,
  `Class.RunService.Heartbeat|Heartbeat` and
  `Class.RunService.PreRender|PreRender`. Selecting the proper event to use for
  any case is important, so you should read
  [Task Scheduler](../../../studio/microprofiler/task-scheduler.md) to make an
  informed decision.

  - name: RunService:BindToRenderStep
    summary: |
      Given a string name of a function and a priority, this method binds the
      function to `Class.RunService.PreRender`.
    description: |
      The `BindToRenderStep` function binds a custom function to be called at a
      specific time during the render step. There are three main arguments for
      BindToRenderStep: `name`, `priority`, and what `function` to call.

      As it is linked to the client's rendering process, BindToRenderStep can
      only be called on the client.

      #### Name

      The `name` parameter is a label for the binding, and can be used with
      `Class.RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep()` if the binding is no longer
      needed.

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local function functionToBind() end

      -- Bind the function above to the binding named "tempBinding"
      RunService:BindToRenderStep("tempBinding", 1, functionToBind)
      -- Unbind the function bound to "tempBinding"
      RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep("tempBinding")
      ```

      #### Priority

      The `priority` of the binding is an integer, and determines when during
      the render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the
      sooner the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same
      priority the Roblox engine will randomly pick one to run first. The
      default Roblox control scripts run with these specific priorities:

      - Player Input: 100
      - Camera Controls: 200 For convenience, the `Enum.RenderPriority` enum can
        be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For example, to
        make a binding right before the default camera update, simply subtract 1
        from the camera priority level.

      When using Enum.RenderPriority, remember to use **_InlineCode.Value_** at
      the end of the desired enum. BindToRenderStep will not work if just the
      enum on its own is used.

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local function beforeCamera(delta)
      	-- Code in here will run before the default Roblox camera script
      end

      RunService:BindToRenderStep("Before camera", Enum.RenderPriority.Camera.Value - 1, beforeCamera)
      ```

      #### Custom Function and Delta Time

      The last argument of BindToRenderStep is the `custom function` to call.
      This function will be passed one parameter called deltaTime.
      **_DeltaTime_** shows how much time passed between the beginning of the
      previous render step and the beginning of the current render step.

      All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step
      finishes. Make sure that any code called by BindToRenderStep runs quickly
      and efficiently. If code in BindToRenderStep takes too long, then the game
      visuals will be choppy.

          The **name** parameter is a label for the binding, and can be used

        default:
        summary: |
          The _priority_ of the binding is an integer, and determines when

          number, the sooner the custom function will be called. If two bindings
          have the same priority the Roblox engine will randomly pick one to run
          first. The default Roblox control scripts run with these specific
          priorities:

      This function returns whether the current environment is running on the
      client.

      If the code that invoked this method is running in a client context (in a
      `Class.LocalScript` or a `Class.ModuleScript` required by a
      `Class.LocalScript`) then this method will return _true_. In all other
      cases, this function will return _false_.

      If this function returns true, then the current environment can access
      client-only features like `Class.RunService.PreRender` or
      `Class.Players.LocalPlayer`.

      If the user has pressed 'Run', then this function will return _true_. This
      function will continue to return _true_ if the simulation has been paused
      using the 'Pause' button. However, once it has been stopped using the

      When the simulation is running, `Class.RunService:IsRunning()` will return
      _true_. However, `Class.RunService:IsRunMode()` will only return _true_ if
      the simulation was started using the 'Run' button in Roblox Studio. This
      means when this function is used to start the simulation, IsRunMode will
      return _false_ even though the simulation is running.

      The simulation can be paused using `Class.RunService:Pause()` or the
      'Pause' button in Roblox Studio. It can also be ended using
      `Class.RunService:Stop()`.

      Running the simulation can be used to assist with debugging in Roblox

      was in prior to running the simulation if the simulation was started using
      this function. If this is a problem, instead use the 'Run' button in
      Roblox Studio.

    description: |
      The Heartbeat event fires every _frame_, after the physics simulation has
      completed. The _step_ argument indicates the time that has elapsed since
      the previous frame.

      As Heartbeat fires every frame, it runs on a **variable frequency**. This
      means the rate will vary depending on the performance of the machine. If
      the game is running at 40 FPS, then Heartbeat will fire 40 times per
      second and the _step_ argument will be roughly 1/40th of a second.

      The _step_ argument can be used to account for the variable frequency of
      this event, for example:

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local RATE_PER_SECOND = 2

      RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function(step)
      	local increment = RATE_PER_SECOND * step
      end)
      ```

      There is no guarantee that functions connected to this event will fire at
      the exact same time, or in any specific order. For an alternative where
      the priority can be specified, see `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()`.

      Fires every _frame_ prior to the frame being rendered.
    description: |
      The RenderStepped event fires every _frame_, prior to the frame being
      rendered. The _step_ argument indicates the time that has elapsed since
      the previous frame.

      RenderStepped does not run in parallel to Roblox's rendering tasks and
      code connected to RenderStepped must be executed prior to the frame being
      rendered. This can lead to significant performance issues if RenderStepped
      is used inappropriately. To avoid this, only use RenderStepped for code
      that works with the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera|camera` or
      `Class.Player.Character|character`. Otherwise,
      `Class.RunService.Heartbeat` should be used.

      As RenderStepped fires every frame, it runs on a **variable frequency**.
      This means the rate will vary depending on the performance of the machine.
      If the game is running at 40 FPS, then RenderStepped will fire 40 times
      per second and the _step_ argument will be roughly 1/40th of a second.

      The _step_ argument can be used to account for the variable frequency of
      this event, for example:

      ```lua
      local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

      local RATE_PER_SECOND = 2

      RunService.RenderStepped:Connect(function(step)
      	local increment = RATE_PER_SECOND * step
      end)
      ```

      There is no guarantee that functions connected to this event will fire at
      the exact same time, or in any specific order. For an alternative where
      the priority can be specified, see `Class.RunService:BindToRenderStep()`.

      As RenderStepped is client-side only, it can be used in a
      `Class.LocalScript` or a `Class.ModuleScript` required by a LocalScript.
