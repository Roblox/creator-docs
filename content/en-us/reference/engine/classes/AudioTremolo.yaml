name: AudioTremolo
type: class
memory_category: Internal
summary: |
  Creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying the volume of the sound up
  and down.
description: |
  `Class.AudioTremolo` creates a trembling effect on a sound by varying the
  volume of the sound up and down. It provides one **Input** pin and one
  **Output** pin which can be connected to/from by `Class.Wire|Wires`.

      Controls how much the volume will raise and lower.
    description: |
      Controls how much the volume will raise and lower, ranging between `0` and
      `1` with a default of `1`. If set to `0`, the volume will not oscillate at
      all.

    description: |
      Controls how long the effect will be active during one volume oscillation
      in the range of `0` (0%) to `1` (100%). Default is `0.5`.

    description: |
      Sets how often the effect will oscillate the volume, measured in Hz, in
      the range of `0.1` to `20`. Default is `5`.

    description: |
      Morphs the LFO (low frequency oscillation) shape in a range of `0` to `1`
      where `0` is triangle and `1` is sine. Default is `0`.

    description: |
      Controls the time-skewing of the LFO (low frequency oscillation) cycle in
      the range of `-1` to `1`. No skewing occurs at `0`, with more extremal
      forwards and backwards skewing towards `+1`/`-1`. Default is `0`.

    summary: |
      Flatness of the low frequency oscillations shape.
    description: |
      Determines the squareness of the oscillations in the range of `0` to `1`.
      The original shape is retained when `0` and the shape flattens more as the
      value increases. Default is `0`.
