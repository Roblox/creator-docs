name: TextLabel
type: class
category: GUI
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  A 2D user interface element that displays non-interactive text.
description: |
  A TextLabel renders a rectangle, like a `Class.Frame`, with styled text. The
  rectangle can be used to define text boundaries, text scaling
  (`Class.TextLabel.TextScaled`) and wrapping (`Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped`,
  `Class.TextLabel.TextXAlignment`, `Class.TextLabel.TextYAlignment`).

  This class contains properties that control the display of the text, such as
  `Class.TextLabel.Font` and `Class.TextLabel.TextColor3`. All text rendered by
  a single text label will have the same visual properties; multiple TextLabel
  objects must be used in order to render multiple styles of text. To display
  only text and hide the rectangle, set `Class.GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency`
  to 1.

  `Class.TextService:GetTextSize()` can be used to get the size (bounds) of text
  that would be rendered in a TextLabel given a font size, font, and frame size.

  A `Class.UITextSizeConstraint` object can be used to constrain the size of
  text with `Class.TextLabel.TextScaled` enabled. It is recommended that the
  size of text is no lower than 9, otherwise it may not be visible to most
  users.

    description: |
      This property provides a copy of `Class.TextLabel.Text` that contains
      exactly what is being rendered by the `Class.TextLabel`. This is useful
      for eliminating style tags used for rich text.

      #### Example

      When `Class.TextLabel.RichText` is enabled, the
      `Class.TextLabel.ContentText` property shows the text as it appears to the
      player.

                  <th>RichText</th>

      The Font property selects one of several pre-defined fonts with which the

      variants (as there is no font-weight or font-style properties).

      With the exception of the "Legacy" font, each font will render text with
      the line height equal to the `Class.TextLabel.TextSize` property. The
      "Code" font is the only monospace font. It has the unique property that
      each character has the exact same width and height ratio of 1:2. The width
      of each character is approximately half the `Class.TextLabel.TextSize`
      property.

      This property is kept in sync with the `Class.TextLabel.FontFace`
      property. When setting Font, the FontFace will be set to
      `Datatype.Font.fromEnum(value)`.

    summary: |
      Determines whether text in a UI element is scaled to fill the UI element.
    description: |
      Rather than using TextScaled, we recommend you consider using
      `Class.GuiObject.AutomaticSize|AutomaticSize`, a new method to dynamically
      size UI that will give you the best visual result possible.

      The TextScaled property determines whether text is scaled so that it fills
      the entire UI element's space. When this is enabled,
      `Class.TextLabel.TextSize` is ignored and `Class.TextLabel.TextWrapped` is
      automatically enabled. This property is useful for text-rendering UI
      elements within `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`.

      When this property is used for screen-space UI, it may be desirable to use
      a `Class.UITextSizeConstraint` to restrict the range of possible text
      sizes.

      #### TextScaled and AutomaticSize

      It's recommended that developers avoid usage of TextScaled and adjust UI
      to take advantage of the AutomaticSize property instead. Here are the core
      differences between the two properties:

      - TextScaled scales the content (text) to accommodate the UI. Without
        careful consideration, some text may become unreadable if scaled too
        small.
      - AutomaticSize resizes the UI to accommodate content.

      With AutomaticSize, you're able to adjust your UI to accommodate the
      content (text) while maintaining a consistent font size. For more
      information on how to use automatic sizing, see the UI Automatic Size
      article.

      We suggest that you don't apply both TextScaled and AutomaticSize on the
      same UI object. If you apply both properties:

      - AutomaticSize determines the maximum amount of available space that a
        `Class.GuiObject` can use (in this case, text)
      - TextScaled uses the available space determined by AutomaticSize, to
        scale the font size to fit the available space, which will expand up to
        the maximum font size (100), if there are no size constraints
      - The end result will be: text goes to 100 font size and the UI object
        will expand to fit that text

      Using both AutomaticSize and TextScaled at the same time can result in
      significant scaling differences than when AutomaticSize is off.

      Determine the line height of text in offsets.
    description: |
      The TextSize property determines the height in offsets of one line of
      rendered text. The unit is in offsets, not points (which is used in most
      document editing programs). It's worth noting that the "Legacy" font's
      line height behaves differently, and won't match this property exactly.

      This property and `Class.TextLabel.TextColor3`,
      `Class.TextLabel.TextTransparency`, `Class.TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3` and
      `Class.TextLabel.TextStrokeTransparency` each influence the way text is
      rendered.

      This property supersedes `Class.TextLabel.FontSize` since it is a number
      and not an enum. Internally, Roblox uses several sets of pre-rendered
      character images for each size of each font. It chooses the closest size
      to TextSize, then scales that set of character images to render text.
      Before the introduction of this property, you could only pick from the
      pre-rendered sizes, which were listed by the `Enum.FontSize` enum.

      TextStrokeTransparency of 0.5 appears about the same as TextTransparency
      of 0.0625, or 0.5^4). Therefore, it's recommended to set
      TextStrokeTransparency to a value in the range of 0.75 to 1 for more a
      more subtle effect.

      the past-tense version instead.

    summary: |
      Determines if text wraps to multiple lines within the
      `Class.TextLabel|GUI` element space, truncating excess text.
    description: |
      When enabled, this property will render text on multiple lines within a
      `Class.TextLabel|GUI` element's space so that `Class.TextLabel.TextBounds`
      will never exceed the `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize` of the UI element.

      This is achieved by breaking long lines of text into multiple lines. Line
      breaks will prefer whitespace; should a long unbroken word exceed the
      width of the element, that word will be broken into multiple lines.

      If further line breaks would cause the vertical height of the text (the Y
      component of `Class.TextLabel.TextBounds`) to exceed the vertical height
      of the element (the Y component of `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize`), then
      that line will not be rendered at all.

      Determines the horizontal alignment of rendered text.
    description: |
      TextXAlignment determines the horizontal alignment (X-axis) of text
      rendered within a UI element's space. It functions similarly to the CSS
      text-align property, with left, right and center values (there is no
      justify option). For Left and Right, text is rendered such that the
      left/right text bounds just touch the edge of the UI element rectangle.
      For Center, each line of text is centered on the very center of the UI
      element rectangle.

      This property is used in conjunction with `Class.TextLabel.TextYAlignment`
      to fully determine text alignment on both axes. This property won't affect
      the read-only properties `Class.TextLabel.TextBounds` and
      `Class.TextLabel.TextFits`.

      Determines the vertical alignment of rendered text.
    description: |
      TextYAlignment determines the vertical alignment (Y-axis) of text rendered
      within a UI element's space. For Top and Bottom, text is rendered such
      that the top/bottom text bounds just touch the edge of the UI element
      rectangle. For Center, text is rendered such that there is an equal space
      from the top bounds of the text to the top of the element and the bottom
      bounds of the text to the bottom of the element.
