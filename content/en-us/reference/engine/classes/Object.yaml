  `Object` is the base class for all classes in the Roblox class hierarchy.
  Every other class that the Roblox Engine defines inherits all of the members
  of `Object`. It is not possible to directly create an `Object`.

    summary: |
      A read-only string representing the class this `Class.Object` belongs to.
    description: |
      A read-only string representing the class this `Class.Object` belongs to.

      This property can be used with various other functions that are used to
      identify objects by type, such as `Class.Object:IsA()` or
      `Class.Instance:FindFirstChildOfClass()`.

      Note this property is read only and cannot be altered by scripts.
      Developers wishing to change an object's class will instead have to create
      a new `Class.Object`.

      Unlike `Class.Object:IsA()`, ClassName can be used to check if an object
      belongs to a specific class ignoring class inheritance. For example:

      ```
      for _, child in workspace:GetChildren() do
          if child.ClassName == "Part" then
              print("Found a Part")
              -- will find Parts in model, but NOT TrussParts, WedgeParts, etc
          end
      end
      ```

methods:
  - name: Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal
    summary: |
      Get an event that fires when a given property of the object changes.
    description: |
      This method returns an event that behaves exactly like the
      `Class.Object.Changed|Changed` event, except that it only fires when the
      given property changes. It's generally a good idea to use this method
      instead of a connection to `Class.Object.Changed|Changed` with a function
      that checks the property name. Subsequent calls to this method on the same
      object with the same property name return the same event.

      `Class.ValueBase` objects, such as `Class.IntValue` and
      `Class.StringValue`, use a modified `Class.Object.Changed|Changed` event
      that fires with the contents of their `Value` property. As such, this
      method provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those
      objects.

      Note that this event will not pass any arguments to a connected function,
      so the value of the changed property must be read directly within a
      script.

      #### Limitations

      The event returned by this method does **not** fire for physics-related
      changes, such as when the `Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame`,
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity`,
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity`,
      `Class.BasePart.Position|Position`, or
      `Class.BasePart.Orientation|Orientation` properties of a `Class.BasePart`
      change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider
      using a physics-based event like `Class.RunService.PreSimulation`.

      Additionally, the returned event may not fire on every modification of
      properties that change very frequently, and/or it may not fire for such
      properties at all. It's recommended that you carefully test for property
      changes that impact game logic.

  - name: Object:IsA
    summary: |
      Returns true if an object's class matches or inherits from a given class.
    description: |
      IsA returns true if the object's class is **equivalent to** or a
      **subclass** of a given class. This function is similar to the
      **instanceof** operators in other languages, and is a form of
      [type introspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection). To
      ignore class inheritance, test the `Class.Object.ClassName|ClassName`
      property directly instead. For checking native Luau data types (number,
      string, etc) use the functions `type` and `typeof`.

      Most commonly, this function is used to test if an object is some kind of
      part, such as `Class.Part` or `Class.WedgePart`, which inherits from
      `Class.BasePart` (an abstract class). For example, if your goal is to
      change all of a character's limbs to the same color, you might use
      `Class.Instance:GetChildren()|GetChildren` to iterate over the children,
      then use IsA to filter non-`Class.BasePart` objects which lack the
      `Datatype.BrickColor` property:

      ```lua
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")

      local function paintFigure(character, color)
      	-- Iterate over the child objects of the character
      	for _, child in character:GetChildren() do
      		-- Filter out non-part objects, such as Shirt, Pants and Humanoid
      		-- R15 use MeshPart and R6 use Part, so we use BasePart here to detect both:
      		if child:IsA("BasePart") then
      			child.BrickColor = color
      		end
      	end
      end
      paintFigure(Players.Player.Character, BrickColor.new("Bright blue"))
      ```

      Since all classes inherit from `Class.Object`, calling
      `object:IsA("Object")` will always return true.

events:
  - name: Object.Changed
    summary: |
      Fires immediately after a property of the object changes, with some
      limitations.
    description: |
      This event fires immediately after an object property is changed, with
      some exceptions (see below). The new value of a changed property is
      **not** passed as a parameter. Instead, you can access it using
      `object[property]`:

      ```
      object.Changed:Connect(function(property)
      	print("The new property's value is", object[property])
      end)
      ```

      - If you are only interested in listening for changes to one specific
        property, consider using the
        `Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()|GetPropertyChangedSignal()`
        method instead.
      - To listen for changes in attributes, see
        `Class.Instance:GetAttributeChangedSignal()` and
        `Class.Instance.AttributeChanged`.
      - To detect when children are added or removed, see
        `Class.Instance.ChildAdded` and `Class.Instance.ChildRemoved`.

      For `Class.ValueBase` objects such as `Class.IntValue` and
      `Class.StringValue`, this event only fires when the object's `Value`
      property changes. To detect other changes in `Class.ValueBase` objects,
      use `Class.Object:GetPropertyChangedSignal()|GetPropertyChangedSignal()`.

      #### Limitations

      This event does **not** fire for physics-related changes, such as when the
      `Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame`,
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity`,
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyAngularVelocity|AssemblyAngularVelocity`,
      `Class.BasePart.Position|Position`, or
      `Class.BasePart.Orientation|Orientation` properties of a `Class.BasePart`
      change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider
      using a physics-based event like `Class.RunService.PreSimulation`.
      Similarly, the `Changed` event does not fire when
      `Class.BasePart.AssemblyMass|AssemblyMass` updates due to a change in
      material, size, or density for a welded part (but the event does fire for
      `Class.BasePart.Mass|Mass` if you modify a part's size).

      For properties that change frequently, the `Changed` event might not fire
      for every modification, or it might not fire at all. **If a property
      change impacts your game logic, test carefully** to ensure the event is
      firing as you expect.
