  Applies a force to maintain a constant velocity.
description: |
  The `Class.BodyVelocity` object applies a force on a `Class.BasePart` such
  that it will maintain a constant velocity. The `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity`
  property, not to be confused wtih `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity`,
  controls the goal velocity.

  `Class.BodyVelocity` is the linear counterpart to `Class.BodyAngularVelocity`.
  If you need the part to move toward a goal position, use `Class.BodyPosition`
  instead. If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider
  using a `Class.BodyForce` or `Class.BodyThrust` instead.

  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several
  factors, namely the difference between the part's current velocity and the
  goal velocity. This is multiplied by `Class.BodyVelocity.P|P` (power) to
  either amplify or diminish it. The resulting force is then capped by
  `Class.BodyVelocity.MaxForce|MaxForce`.

    description: |
      The MaxForce property determines the limit on the amount of force that may
      be applied on each axis in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. If a part isn't moving, consider
      increasing this value (also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored parts).

      his property is ignored if PGS is enabled via
      Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled, which is enabled by default.

      The P property determines how much
      [power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
      applying force in order to reach the goal
      `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. The higher this value, the more
      power will be used and the faster it will be used. The force the
      `Class.BodyVelocity` exerts increases as the difference between the part's
      current velocity and the goal velocity increases. This property is
      multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish it.

      determines the target velocity towards which force will be exerted. It is
