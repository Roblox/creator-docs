  Applies a force to maintain a constant velocity.
description: |
  The `Class.BodyVelocity` object applies a force on a `Class.BasePart` such
  that it will maintain a constant velocity. The `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity`
  property, not to be confused with `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity`,
  controls the goal velocity.

  `Class.BodyVelocity` is the linear counterpart to `Class.BodyAngularVelocity`.
  If you need the part to move toward a goal position, use `Class.BodyPosition`
  instead. If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider
  using a `Class.BodyForce` or `Class.BodyThrust` instead.

  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several
  factors, namely the difference between the part's current velocity and the
  goal velocity. This is multiplied by `Class.BodyVelocity.P|P` (power) to
  either amplify or diminish it. The resulting force is then capped by
  `Class.BodyVelocity.MaxForce|MaxForce`.

    description: |
      The MaxForce property determines the limit on the amount of force that may
      be applied on each axis in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. If a part isn't moving, consider
      increasing this value (also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored parts).

      his property is ignored if PGS is enabled via
      Workspace.PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled, which is enabled by default.

      The P property determines how much
      [power](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)>) is used while
      applying force in order to reach the goal
      `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. The higher this value, the more
      power will be used and the faster it will be used. The force the
      `Class.BodyVelocity` exerts increases as the difference between the part's
      current velocity and the goal velocity increases. This property is
      multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish it.
