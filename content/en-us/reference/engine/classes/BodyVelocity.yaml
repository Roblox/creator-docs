name: BodyVelocity
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a force to maintain a constant velocity.
description: |
  The `BodyVelocity` object applies a force on an assembly such that it will
  maintain a constant velocity. The `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`
  property, not to be confused with `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity`,
  controls the goal velocity.

  `Class.BodyVelocity` is the linear counterpart to `Class.BodyAngularVelocity`.
  If you need the assembly to move toward a goal position, use
  `Class.BodyPosition` instead. If you need further control on a force applied
  to an object, consider using a `Class.BodyForce` or `Class.BodyThrust`
  instead.

  The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several
  factors, namely the difference between the assembly's current velocity and the
  goal velocity. This is multiplied by `Class.BodyVelocity.P|P` (power) to
  either amplify or diminish it. The resulting force is then capped by
  `Class.BodyVelocity.MaxForce|MaxForce`.

    description: |
      This property determines the limit on the amount of force that may be
      applied on each axis in reaching the goal
      `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. If an assembly isn't moving,
      consider increasing this value and also check that it is not
      `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored` or attached to any anchored assemblies.

    summary: |
      Determines how aggressive of a force is applied in reaching the goal
      velocity.
    description: |
      This property determines how much power is used while applying force in
      order to reach the goal `Class.BodyVelocity.Velocity|Velocity`. The higher
      this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.
      The force the `Class.BodyVelocity` exerts increases as the difference
      between the assembly's current velocity and the goal velocity increases.
      This property is multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish
      it.
