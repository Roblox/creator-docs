summary: |
  An instance used to prevent collisions between two specific parts.
description: |
  The **NoCollisionConstraint** prevents collisions between two specific parts,
  but those parts may still register collisions with the rest of the world.
  Compared to
  [collision groups](../../../workspace/collisions.md#collision-filtering), it
  provides a direct way to disable specific collisions, such as the wheel of a
  car scraping against the car's body.

  The most common way to create this constraint is by selecting
  **No&nbsp;Collision** through Studio's **Create** menu in the
  [Model](../../../studio/model-tab.md) tab.

  Unlike most constraints, `Class.NoCollisionConstraint` does not utilize any
  `Class.Attachment|Attachments`. Note that the tool acts differently based on
  how many parts are selected when the tool is activated:

  <table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Option</td>
      <td>Tool Behavior</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>No parts selected</td>
      <td>The next two parts that are clicked will be linked together. If the same part is clicked twice, no link will be created.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One part selected</td>
      <td>The next part that is clicked will be linked to the selected part.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Two parts selected</td>
      <td>Both selected parts will be linked together.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
