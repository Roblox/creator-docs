  Emits audio streams into the world.
description: |
  `Class.AudioEmitter` emits audio streams into the world. It provides a single
  **Input** pin that can be connected to by one or more `Class.Wire|Wires`. Any
  streams wired to an `Class.AudioEmitter` get broadcasted into the world from
  the emitter's parent's position. If the parent is an `Class.Attachment`,
  `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`, the parent's world-position will be
  used. If the parent is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioEmitter` is
  effectively silent.

  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` are heard by
  `Class.AudioListener|AudioListeners` in order to implement 3D spatialization.

      If an `Class.AudioEmitter` and an `Class.AudioListener` share an
      interaction group, then the listener is capable of hearing the emitter.
