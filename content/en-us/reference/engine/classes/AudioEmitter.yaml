summary: |
  Emits audio streams into the world.
description: |
  `Class.AudioEmitter` emits audio streams into the world. It provides a single
  **Input** pin that can be connected to by one or more `Class.Wire|Wires`. Any
  streams wired to an `Class.AudioEmitter` get broadcasted into the world from
  the emitter's parent's position. If the parent is an `Class.Attachment`,
  `Class.Camera`, or `Class.PVInstance`, the parent's world-position will be
  used. If the parent is not one of these classes, the `Class.AudioEmitter` is
  effectively silent.

  `Class.AudioEmitter|AudioEmitters` are heard by
  `Class.AudioListener|AudioListeners` in order to implement 3D spatialization.

    summary: |
      Sets the angle attenuation curve that the `Class.AudioEmitter` should use,

    description: |
      Sets a volume-over-angle curve that affects how loudly a
      `Class.AudioListener` will hear the `Class.AudioEmitter`, based on the
      angle between them and the `Datatype.CFrame.LookVector|LookVector`
      associated with the `Class.AudioEmitter`.

      The curve is represented by a table mapping angle keys to volume values.
      Keys are expected to be unique numbers between `0` and `180` (inclusive),
      while values are expected to be numbers between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
      Tables containing up to 400 key-value pairs are supported.

      The volume of the `Class.AudioEmitter` from the perspective of a
      `Class.AudioListener` at an angle `a` is determined by linearly
      interpolating between the volume levels for the points on the curve whose
      angle values are directly above and below `a`. If there is either no point
      below `a` or no point above `a`, the volume level of the other point is
      chosen. Essentially, the curve is a sequence of points connected by
      straight lines, and beyond its left and right endpoints the curve extends
      outward at their respective volume levels.

      This volume will be multiplied with the volumes from all other attenuation
      curves (including the ones on the receiving `Class.AudioListener`) to
      obtain the final audibility.

      If the table is empty or `nil`, the `Class.AudioEmitter` defaults to using
      an angle attenuation curve with the constant volume value of `1`.

      The volume of the `Class.AudioEmitter` from the perspective of a
      `Class.AudioListener` at a distance `d` is determined by linearly
      interpolating between the volume levels for the points on the curve whose
      distance values are directly above and below `d`. If there is either no
      point below `d` or no point above `d`, the volume level of the other point
      is chosen. Essentially, the curve is a sequence of points connected by
      straight lines, and beyond its left and right endpoints the curve extends
      outward infinitely at their respective volume levels.

      This volume will be multiplied with the volumes from all other attenuation
      curves (including the ones on the receiving `Class.AudioListener`) to
      obtain the final audibility.

      If the table is empty or `nil`, the `Class.AudioEmitter` defaults to using
      a distance attenuation curve determined by the inverse-square law.
