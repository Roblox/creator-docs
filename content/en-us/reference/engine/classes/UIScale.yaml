    summary: |
      Determines the multiplier to apply to the parent UI element's size.
    description: |
      The Scale property determines the multiplier used on the parent UI
      element's `Class.GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize`. When set to 0.5, an AbsoluteSize
      of {0, 200}, {0, 50} becomes {0, 100}, {0, 25}. Similarly, when set to 2,
      such an AbsoluteSize would become {0, 400}, {0, 100}.
