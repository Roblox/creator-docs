  Performance metrics for a game.
description: |
  `Class.Stats` is a service that provides real-time performance information
  about the current running game instance. Its primary purpose is to provide an
  end point to measure where resources are being consumed, as well as how much
  memory is being consumed overall.

  The service also stores a tree of `Class.StatsItem` objects which can have
  their values read by plugins.

      A measurement of how many parts are currently in contact with one another.
    description: |
      This property describes how many parts are currently in contact with each
      other, such that one of the two parts are being physically simulated, and
      thus can be recognized by the `Class.BasePart:GetTouchingParts()` method.

      This property is only available in client scripts and is a measurement of
      how long it took to render the most-recent frame in seconds. Divide 1 by
      this value to calculate an FPS value for the frame time. High frame times
      are indicative of performance problems on the device. Consider using the
      [MicroProfiler](/studio/microprofiler) to troubleshoot.
