  Models are container objects, meaning they group objects together. They are
  best used to hold collections of `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` and have a number
  of functions that extend their functionality.

  Models are intended to represent **geometric** groupings. If your grouping has
  no geometric interpretation, for instance a collection of
  `Class.Script|Scripts`, use a `Class.Folder` instead.

  Models whose constituent parts are joined together with joints (so that they
  can move around or be destroyed via physics simulation) usually have a
  `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart` set, as it specifies which part within
  the model the pivot and bounding box will "follow" as the model moves. Static
  models which stay in one place do not benefit from having a primary part set.

  Models have a wide range of applications, including Roblox player characters.
  They also have a number of unique behaviors that are important to keep in
  mind:

  - When a `Class.Humanoid` and a `Class.Part` named **Head** are parented under
    a model, a name/health GUI will appear over the model; see
    [Character Name/Health Display](../../../characters/name-health-display.md)
    for details.
  - If a part's position on the **Y** axis hits the
    `Class.Workspace.FallenPartsDestroyHeight` value, and it was the last object
    inside of a `Class.Model`, the model will be destroyed as well.
  - When used in a place with `Class.Workspace.StreamingEnabled` set to true,
    the value of `Class.Model.ModelStreamingMode|ModelStreamingMode` controls
    various behaviors around how the model and any descendants are replicated
    and/or removed from clients. In addition, the value of
    `Class.Model.LevelOfDetail|LevelOfDetail` impacts rendering of the model.

  As with all `Class.Instance` types, the fact that a parent `Class.Model` is
  replicated to a client does not guarantee that all its children are
  replicated. This is particularly important if these instances are being
  accessed by code running on the client, such as in a `Class.LocalScript`.
  Using `Class.Model.ModelStreamingMode|ModelStreamingMode` with values such as
  `Enum.ModelStreamingMode|Atomic` can ensure that the entire model and all of
  its descendants are present if the parent model exists on the client, or you
  can use `Class.Instance:WaitForChild()|WaitForChild()` when atomicity is not
  desired.

    description: |
      Points to the primary part of the `Class.Model`. The primary part is the
      `Class.BasePart` that acts as the physical reference for the pivot of the
      model. That is, when parts within the model are moved due to physical
      simulation or other means, the pivot will move in sync with the primary
      part. If the primary part is **not** set, the pivot will remain at the
      same location in world space even if parts within the model are moved.

      Note that when setting this property, it must be a `Class.BasePart` that
      is a descendant of the model. If you try to set `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`
      to a `Class.BasePart` that is **not** a descendant of the model, it will
      be set to that part but reset to `nil` during the next simulation step
      &mdash; this is legacy behavior to support scripts which assume they can
      temporarily set the primary part to a `Class.BasePart` which isn't a
      descendant of the model.

      The general rule for models is that:

      - Models whose parts are joined together via physical joints such as
        `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints` or `Class.Motor6D|Motor6Ds`
        should have a primary part assigned. For example, Roblox character
        models have their `Class.Model.PrimaryPart` set to the
        **HumanoidRootPart** by default.
      - Static (usually `Class.BasePart.Anchored|Anchored`) models which stay in
        one place unless a script explicitly moves them don't require a
        `Class.Model.PrimaryPart` and tend not to benefit from having one set.

    description: |
      This property determines where the pivot of a `Class.Model` which does
      **not** have a set `Class.Model.PrimaryPart` is located. If the
      `Class.Model` **does** have a `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart`, the
      pivot of the `Class.Model` is equal to the pivot of that primary part
      instead, and this `Class.Model.WorldPivot|WorldPivot` property is ignored.

      For a newly created `Class.Model`, its pivot will be treated as the center
      of the bounding box of its contents until the **first time** its
      `Class.Model.WorldPivot` property is set. Once the world pivot is set for
      the first time, it is impossible to restore this initial behavior.

      Most commonly, moving the model with the Studio tools, or with model
      movement functions such as `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()` and
      `Class.Model:MoveTo()`, will set the world pivot and thus end this new
      model behavior.

      The purpose of this behavior is to allow Lua code to get a sensible pivot
      simply by creating a new model and parenting objects to it, avoiding the
      need to explicitly set `Class.Model.WorldPivot` every time you create a
      model in code.

      ```
      local model = Instance.new("Model")
      workspace.BluePart.Parent = model
      workspace.RedPart.Parent = model
      model.Parent = workspace

      print(model:GetPivot())  -- Currently equal to the center of the bounding box containing "BluePart" and "RedPart"

      model:PivotTo(CFrame.new(0, 10, 0))  -- This works without needing to explicitly set "model.WorldPivot"

    description: |
      This function returns a description of a volume that contains all
      `Class.BasePart` children within a `Class.Model`. The volume's orientation
      is based on the orientation of the `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart`,
      and matches the selection box rendered in Studio when the model is
      selected. The description is provided in the form of a `Datatype.CFrame`
      **orientation** and `Datatype.Vector3` **size**.

      Mirroring the behavior of `Class.Terrain:FillBlock()`, it returns a CFrame
      representing the center of that bounding box and a Vector3 representing
      its size.

      If there is no PrimaryPart for the model, the BoundingBox will be aligned
      to the world axes.

      #### Example

      Pictured below is a `Class.Model` with a pink semitransparent `Class.Part`
      whose `Class.BasePart.CFrame|CFrame` and `Class.BasePart.Size|Size` have
      been set to the return values of this function called on the model.

      Models contain a persistent canonical scale factor, which starts out at 1
      for newly created models and changes as the model is scaled by calling
      `Model/ScaleTo`. This function returns the current canonical scale factor
      of the model.

      The current scale factor does not _directly_ impact the size of Instances
      under the model. It is used for content authoring and scripting purposes
      to remember how the model has been scaled relative to its original size.

      Within a given session, the model will cache the precise original size
      information of the descendant Instances after the first `Model/ScaleTo`
      call. This means that calling `ScaleTo(x)` followed by `ScaleTo(1)` will
      get you back _exactly_ the original configuration of the model with no
      floating point drift. Avoiding floating point drift is the motivation for
      having a Scale**To** function instead of a Scale**By** function.

      The scale factor does impact engine behavior in one way: The scale factor
      of a model will be applied to joint offsets of
      `Class.Animation|animations` played on an `Class.AnimationController`

  - name: Model:ScaleTo
    summary: |
      Sets the scale factor of the model, adjusting the sizing and location of
      all descendant Instances such that they have that scale factor relative to
      their initial sizes and locations when scale factor was 1.
    description: |
      Models contain a persistent canonical scale factor, which starts out at 1
      for newly created models. This function scales the model, around the pivot
      location, relative to how it would look at a scale factor of 1. To
      accomplish this it does two things:

      - Sets the current scale factor of the model to the specified value
      - Resizes and repositions all descendant Instances accordingly

      The scaling of locations is done around the pivot location.

      All "geometric" properties of descendant Instances will be scaled. That
      obviously includes the sizes of parts, but here are some other examples of
      properties which are scaled:

      - The length of joints like `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints`, and
        `Class.Rope|Ropes`
      - Physical velocities and forces like `Hinge.MaxServoTorque`
      - Visual properties like sizes of particle emitters
      - Other length properties like `Sound.RollOffMinDistance`

    summary: |
      Sets the `Class.BasePart.CFrame` of the model's `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`.
      All other parts in the model will also be moved and will maintain their
      orientation and offset respective to the `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`.

      This function has been superseded by `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()` which
      acts as a more performant replacement and does not change your code's
      behavior. Use `Class.PVInstance:PivotTo()` for new work and migrate your
      existing `Class.Model:SetPrimaryPartCFrame()` calls when convenient.

      All other parts in the model will also be moved and will maintain their
      orientation and offset respective to the `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`.

      Note, this function will throw an error if no `Class.Model.PrimaryPart`
      exists for the model. This can cause issues if, for example, the primary
      part was never set or has been destroyed.

      Shifts a `Class.Model` by the given `Datatype.Vector3` offset, preserving

      The translation is applied in world space rather than object space,
      meaning even if the model's parts are orientated differently it will still
      move along the standard axis.
