name: UnreliableRemoteEvent
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  An object which facilitates asynchronous, unordered and unreliable, one-way
  communication across the client-server boundary. Scripts firing a
  `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent` do not yield.
description: |
  The **UnreliableRemoteEvent** object is a variant of the `Class.RemoteEvent`
  object. It facilitates asynchronous, unordered and unreliable, one-way
  communication across the [client-server](../../../projects/client-server.md)
  boundary without yielding for a response. This communication can be directed
  from one client to the server, from the server to a specific client, or from
  the server to all clients.

  In order for both the server and clients to access a
  `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent` instance, it must be in a place where both sides
  can see it, such as `Class.ReplicatedStorage`, although in some cases it's
  appropriate to store it in `Class.Workspace` or inside a `Class.Tool`.

  `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent` is best used for ephemeral events, including
  effects that are only relevant for a short time, or for replicating
  continuously changing data. These events are not resent if they are lost and
  they do not wait for previously fired events to arrive before being processed,
  potentially resulting in reduced latency and network traffic. When you need
  ordering and reliability, use a `Class.RemoteEvent` instead.

  If no connected listener exists to handle an event, you might see a
  `Remote event invocation discarded` error in the log to indicate that the
  event was discarded and that you need to implement either `OnClientEvent` or
  `OnServerEvent`.

  #### Throttling

  Remote events are subject to rate limits when sent from the client to the
  server with the `Class.RemoteEvent:FireServer()|FireServer()` method.
  `Class.RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents` and
  `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent|UnreliableRemoteEvents` both have a limit of
  approximately 500 requests per second, per client. This limit is **shared
  among all remote events of the same type**. To avoid throttling and latency
  issues, limit recurring remote events whenever possible.

  #### Parameter limitations

  Any type of Roblox object (`Datatype.Enum`, `Class.Instance`, etc.) can be
  passed as a parameter when an `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent` is fired, as well
  as Luau types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, although you should
  carefully explore the
  [limitations](../../../scripting/events/remote.md#argument-limitations).

  Events with payloads larger than 1000 bytes are dropped. When this happens in
  Studio, a log message in the [Output](../../../studio/output.md) window
  indicates the number of bytes the event went over.

  Like all events, the `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent` methods encode and compress
  certain object types, such as buffers, which shrinks the payload size and can
  make it difficult to verify whether you are under the limit prior to firing
  the event. If you frequently reach this limit, consider whether a standard
  `Class.RemoteEvent` is the better fit for your use case.

      Fires the `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent` event

      event. Events with larger payloads are dropped.
    description: |
      Fires the `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent.OnClientEvent|OnClientEvent` event
      for all connected clients. Unlike
      `Class.UnreliableRemoteEvent:FireClient()|FireClient()`, this event does
      not take a target `Class.Player` as the first argument, since it fires to
      multiple clients. Since this method is used to communicate from the server
      to clients, it only works when used in a `Class.Script`.
