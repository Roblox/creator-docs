  The TextService is a service internally responsible for handling the display
  of text in the game.

  This class has two member functions:

  The `Class.TextService:GetTextSize()` function gives developers the ability to
  calculate the space required for a specific text string with specified
  formatting, returning a `Datatype.Vector2` pixel size.

  The `Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()` function is required to properly
  filter user specified text (such as chat messages or other inputs) in the
  interests of user safety. Developers not using the Roblox default
  `Class.Chat`, or allowing users to otherwise input text must use this
  function.

      Computes the `Datatype.Vector2` dimensions (in pixels) that will be taken
      up with text when using the specified formatting parameters and size
      constraints.

      Note, the fontSize parameter will not accept the `Enum.FontSize` Enum.
      Instead the integer size corresponding with the `Enum.FontSize` Enum
      should be used. This is not equal to the value of the `Enum.FontSize`
      Enum. For example, for _Size11_ font, the integer _11_ should be used.

      This function is a useful alternative to the `Class.TextLabel.TextBounds`
      property of the `Class.TextLabel` and `Class.TextButton` objects. Using
      the `Class.TextLabel.TextBounds` property to calculate the dimensions text
      requires is often impractical as it requires a `Class.TextLabel` object to
      be created.

      With GetTextSize, the dimensions required by a particular text string in a
      particular `Class.TextLabel` or `Class.TextButton` can be calculated
      before any object is created or text property set.

      Developers are recommended to add a pixel of padding to the result to
      ensure no text is cut off.

      This method is limited to only fonts that are listed in `Enum.Font`. To
      get access to more fonts, you can use
      `Class.TextService:GetTextBoundsAsync()` instead.

    description: |
      The FilterStringAsync function filters a string being received from a
      user, using the `Class.TextService`, and returns a
      `Class.TextFilterResult` which can be used to distribute the correctly
      filtered text accordingly.

      #### Usage

      This method should be called once each time a user submits a message. Do
      not cache the results of this function and re-use them for separate
      messages. If a user submits the same text multiple times this method must
      be called again each time the message is sent. If the results are cached
      and reused spam detection and many forms of context-aware filtering will
      be broken and potentially put user safety at risk. Games that improperly
      use cached results may face moderation.

      However, it is encouraged to keep these result objects to display the same
      message to users who join the server later. For example: this can be used
      to safely and efficiently implement a server chat log that always uses the
      least restrictive filtering for users who join later, or for efficiently
      displaying text like a pet name to a user who joins the game after the pet
      was first spawned and name filtered.

      The optional `Enum.TextFilterContext` parameter will not impact the
      filtered result of the query. This value will be used to improve Roblox's
      text filtering.

      Private text is anything that is seen only by specific players, rather
      than every player. For example, if the chat is seen by a single player, or
      by a selected group of players, then the chat is considered private. Chat
      for teams or chat that is potentially visible to a wider group, such as
      the server, is considered public. If you are unsure what your text
      qualifies as, leave the optional field blank.

      Note:

      - This method always yields to make a text filtering service call
      - This method may throw if there is a service error that can not be
        resolved. If this function throws an error please do not retry the
        request; this method implements it's own retry logic internally. If this
        method fails do not display the text to any user.
      - This method currently throws if _fromUserId_ is not online on the
        current server. We plan to support users who are offline or on a
        different server in the future.

      Returns a table containing the name and faces of a font family.

      The returned table is structured like this:

      ```lua
      type FaceInfo = {
        Name: string, -- Examples: "Regular", "Book", "Italic", "Thin Italic"
        Weight: Enum.FontWeight,
        Style: Enum.FontStyle, -- Either Normal or Italic
      }

      type FamilyInfo = {
        Name: string, -- Examples: "Source Sans Pro", "Grenze Gotisch"
        Faces: {FaceInfo} -- There's always at least 1 but there can be up to 18.
      }
      ```

      If the font family has already been loaded by a previous call to
      `GetFamilyInfoAsync`, `Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync()`, or a text
      object with the `Class.TextLabel.FontFace` property set, then the method
      returns without yielding.

      #### Errors

      This method can fail because of network errors. You should always wrap it
      in a `pcall` for error handling.

      Throws an error in these scenarios:

      - The passed family is an empty string.
      - Downloading the family failed.
      - The asset ID is invalid or points to an asset that doesn't exist.

      - name: assetId

    returns:
      - type: Dictionary

    description: |
      This method is similar to `Class.TextService:GetTextSize()`, but uses the
      `Datatype.Font` object instead of `Enum.Font`, which has access to more
      fonts.

      Used to measure how big some text will be given a set of properties like
      the string, size, and font.

      This is a yield function because some fonts may need to be loaded in order
      to measure them. If the font is already loaded, then it will not yield.
      `Class.ContentProvider:PreloadAsync()` can be used to make sure a font is
      loaded.

      #### Errors

      This method can fail because of network errors. You should always wrap it
      in a `pcall` for error handling.

      Throws an error in these scenarios:

      - The `Class.GetTextBoundsParams.Font` has a blank family.
      - The `params` argument was nil.
      - The font family or font face failed to download.

      - name: params
        type: GetTextBoundsParams
        default:

          A reference to a `Class.GetTextBoundsParams` object.
    returns:
      - type: Vector2

          The size of the text as a `Datatype.Vector2`.
