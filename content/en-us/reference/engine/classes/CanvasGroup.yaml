name: CanvasGroup
type: class
memory_category: Gui
summary: |
  Blends descendants as a group with color/transparency.
description: |
  CanvasGroup renders descendants as a group with color and transparency applied
  to the render result. GuiEffect (`Class.UICorner` and `Class.UIGradient`)
  under CanvasGroup will also apply to the whole group. CanvasGroup always has
  `Class.GuiObject.ClipsDescendants` set to true and all descendants will render
  within CanvasGroup's viewport.

  ### Important notes:

  - Descendants of CanvasGroup will be rendered as a flattened texture only when
    the ancestor `Class.LayerCollector` has its
    `Class.LayerCollector.ZIndexBehavior` set to `Enum.ZIndexBehavior.Sibling`.
  - CanvasGroup consumes extra texture memory. The quality of the texture and
    total memory usage is limited by the `Enum.QualityLevel` of the client. When
    exceeding the memory cap, CanvasGroup will render as a blank texture.
  - We recommend using CanvasGroup with static sizes, otherwise a new texture
    would need to be created to accommodate new sizes.
