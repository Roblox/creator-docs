summary: |
  Holds two parts together and functions identically to `Class.Weld`.
description: |
  An object that holds two parts together. It is commonly created when the _Join
  Always_ setting in Studio is turned on.

  Functions identically to `Class.Weld`.

  See also `Class.WeldConstraint` for a newer alternative using the
  [constraints](../../../physics/mechanical-constraints.md) system that does not
  require `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0` or `Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` properties
  to be manually set.

  ## Root part

  Every Assembly has a root part, see `Class.BasePart:GetRootPart()`. When a
  ManualWeld's `Class.JointInstance.C0|C0`/`Class.JointInstance.C1|C1` is
  modified the root part will stay where it was.

  ## Directionality

  ManualWelds do not have any directionality. `Class.JointInstance.Part0|Part0`
  or `Class.JointInstance.Part1|Part1`, doesn't matter. You can imagine rigid
  joints forming a tree branching down from the root part. All the parts down
  the tree from root will move, and their welded "children" in this tree will
  move with them.
