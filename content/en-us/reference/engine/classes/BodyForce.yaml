name: BodyForce
type: class
category: Body Movers
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a constant force to an object.
description: |
  The BodyForce object applies (or exerts) a force on the part to which it is
  parented. If the magnitude of such a force is great enough, parts can begin to
  accelerate. The force is determined by the `Class.BodyForce.Force` property,
  and is defined on the three world axes.

  A BodyForce alone cannot apply a torque (it cannot cause the parent to rotate
  on its own). To apply a force at a specific point (e.g. to apply torque for
  angular acceleration) or apply forces relative to the orientation of the part,
  use a `Class.BodyThrust` instead.
