name: BodyForce
type: class
memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a constant force to an object.
description: |
  The `BodyForce` object applies (or exerts) a force on the assembly to which it
  is parented. If the magnitude of such a force is great enough, assemblies can
  begin to accelerate. The force is determined by the
  `Class.BodyForce.Force|Force` property, and is defined on the three world
  axes.

  A `BodyForce` alone cannot apply a torque (it cannot cause the parent to
  rotate on its own). To apply a force at a specific point or apply forces
  relative to the orientation of the assembly, use a `Class.BodyThrust` instead.
