    summary: |
      Sets the overall shape of the object.
    description: |
      The Shape property sets the overall shape of the object to one of a
      predetermined list of built-in shapes.

      The `Enum.PartType` enum controls the shape value, and has five possible
      shapes:

      | Shape/Value | Description                             |
      | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
      | Ball        | A spherical shape, like a basketball.   |
      | Cylinder    | A rod-like shape, like a tin can.       |
      | Block       | The default, brick shape.               |
      | Wedge       | A wedge shape with a slope on one side. |
      | CornerWedge | A wedge shape with slopes on two sides. |

      Note that `Class.MeshPart` and
      [solid modeling](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) can be used to obtain
      completely custom part shapes.
