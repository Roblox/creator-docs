name: Part
type: class
memory_category: BaseParts
summary: |
  A common type of `Class.BasePart` that comes in different primitive shapes.
description: |
  The Part object is a type of `Class.BasePart`. It comes in five different
  primitive shapes: Ball, Block, Cylinder, Wedge, and CornerWedge.

    summary: |
      Sets the overall shape of the object.
    description: |
      The Shape property sets the overall shape of the object to one of a
      predetermined list of built-in shapes.

      The `Enum.PartType` enum controls the shape value, and has five possible
      shapes:

      | Shape/Value | Description                             |
      | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
      | Ball        | A spherical shape.                      |
      | Block       | A block shape.                          |
      | Cylinder    | A cylinder shape.                       |
      | Wedge       | A wedge shape with a slope on one side. |
      | CornerWedge | A wedge shape with slopes on two sides. |

      `Class.MeshPart` and [solid modeling](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md)
      can be used to obtain completely custom part shapes.

      Collisions between balls, blocks, and wedges, and corner wedges are exact,
      whereas collisions between terrain, cylinders, TriangleMeshes, and other
      geometry types are approximations. This means that the ball shape can be
      useful to create stable colliders for car wheels.
