      Attempts to award the user with the specified `Class.Player.UserId` the
      specified number of points.
    description: |
      This function attempts to award the user with the specified
      `Class.Player.UserId` the specified number of points.

      If successful, this function will return the UserId of the user the points
      were awarded to, the number of points awarded, the new total number of
      points the user has in the game and another value which appears to always
      be 0.

      This function will cause an error if the specified UserId is not positive
      or if the number of points specified is 0.

      The function can be used to award a negative number of points to a user
      however.

      ```lua
      local userId, amount, total = game:GetService("PointsService"):AwardPoints(1, 5)
      print("The user was awarded " ..amount.. " points. They have now have a total of " ..total.. " points in this game.")
      ```

      Fires when points have been successfully awarded to a player, while also

      This event fires when points have been successfully awarded to a player,
      while also passing along the updated balance of points the player has in
      the current game and all games.

      When a player is awarded points successfully the below example would print
      the userId and their new point balance. If, for example, the Roblox
      account was awarded thirty points (and had none to begin with)

      > User: 1 has now earned 30 (+30) points in the current game, now making
      > their total balance

      would be printed.

      ```lua
      local function pointsAwarded(userId, pointsAwarded, userBalanceInGame, userTotalBalance)
      	print("User: " .. userId .. " has now earned " .. userBalanceInGame .. " (+" .. pointsAwarded ..") points in the current game, now making their total balance " .. userTotalBalance)
      end

      game:GetService("PointsService").PointsAwarded:Connect(pointsAwarded)
      ```
