name: KeyframeSequence
type: class
memory_category: Animation
summary: |
  This object stores all of the `Class.Keyframe|Keyframes` and other data for
  the animation.
description: |
  `Class.KeyframeSequence` stores all the `Class.Keyframe|Keyframes` for an
  `Class.Animation`, determines if the animation will
  `Class.KeyframeSequence.Loop|Loop`, and determines its
  `Class.KeyframeSequence.Priority|Priority` against other animations. The last
  `Class.Keyframe` in the sequence, meaning the `Class.Keyframe` with the
  highest `Class.Keyframe.Time|Time` property, determines the length of an
  animation.

  Although `Class.KeyframeSequence.Priority|Priority` and
  `Class.KeyframeSequence.Loop|Loop` save the priority and looped animation
  settings for the sequence, note that `Class.AnimationTrack` properties can
  eventually overwrite these properties at playback time.

  If you want to preview an `Class.Animation` before uploading it to Roblox, you
  can generate a temporary hash ID using
  `Class.KeyframeSequenceProvider:RegisterKeyframeSequence()` for localized
  animation testing.

  #### Obtaining Sequences

  In some cases you may wish to download the `Class.KeyframeSequence`
  corresponding to an existing uploaded `Class.Animation`. You can use
  `Class.AnimationClipProvider:GetAnimationClipAsync()` to download an
  animation.

      Contains the hip height of the `Class.Humanoid` of the model that was used

    description: |
      Contains the hip height of the `Class.Humanoid` of the model that was used
      to author this `Class.KeyframeSequence`. Default value is `1.35` since
      that is the hip height set for a standard R15 character.

    summary: |
      Adds a `Class.Keyframe` to the `Class.KeyframeSequence` by parenting it to
      the `Class.KeyframeSequence`.
    description: |
      This method adds a `Class.Keyframe` to the `Class.KeyframeSequence` by
      parenting it to the `Class.KeyframeSequence`. It is functionally identical
      to setting the keyframe's `Class.Instance.Parent` to the
      `Class.KeyframeSequence`.

      Note that this method will not error when called with an instance other
      than a `Class.Keyframe` as the `keyframe` parameter and will parent it
      successfully.

    summary: |
      This method removes a `Class.Keyframe` from the `Class.KeyframeSequence`
      by setting its parent to `nil`.
    description: |
      This method removes a `Class.Keyframe` from the `Class.KeyframeSequence`
      by setting its parent to `nil`. It is functionally identical to setting
      the keyframe's parent to `nil`.

      Note that while this sets the keyframe's parent to `nil`, it does not
      destroy it. Provided another reference to the keyframe remains, it can be
      re-parented later.

      Also note that this method will not error when called with an
      `Class.Instance` other than a `Class.Keyframe` as the keyframe parameter.
