summary: |
  UI modifier which applies deformation to corners of its parent
  `Class.GuiObject`.
description: |
  `Class.UICorner` is a modifier which applies deformation to corners of its
  parent `Class.GuiObject`. Input, but not descendants, will be clipped to the
  round corner area. See [here](../../../ui/appearance-modifiers.md#corners) for
  examples.

  In order to keep the circular shape of round corners with the
  `Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius` value (`Datatype.UDim`), the radius
  is internally calculated as follows:

  - The radius of the **X** axis is always the same as the radius of **Y** axis.
  - `Datatype.UDim.Scale|Scale` rounding will always apply to the **minimum**
    width or height.
  - Rounded rectangles will always be in a "pill" shape if
    `Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius` is set to a value that leads to a
    calculated result greater than half of the rectangle's minimum width or
    height.

  Alternatively, rounded corners can be accomplished using **slices** which are
  suitable for decorative borders that are not simply rounded. See
  [9‑Slice Design](../../../ui/9-slice.md) for details.

  Note that `Class.UICorner` can not be applied to a `Class.ScrollingFrame`.

      A `Datatype.UDim` property that determines the radius of the
      `Class.UICorner` component, internally calculated as follows:

      - The radius of the **X** axis is always the same as the radius of **Y**
        axis.
      - `Datatype.UDim.Scale|Scale` rounding will always apply to the
        **minimum** width or height.
      - Rounded rectangles will always be in a "pill" shape if
        `Class.UICorner.CornerRadius|CornerRadius` is set to a value that leads
        to a calculated result greater than half of the rectangle's minimum
        width or height.
