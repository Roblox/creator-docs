summary: |
  A rotational spring that opposes the angular motion between two axes.
description: |
  A **TorsionSpringConstraint** applies a torque based on a relative angle and a
  relative angular velocity. Specifically, torsion springs try to bring two axes
  from two parts together in a compliant way.

  Correct orientation of a torsion spring's attachments is important. The
  constraint will attempt to bring the
  `Class.Attachment.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis` of each attachment into
  alignment. When building mechanisms like swinging doors, ensure that the
  secondary axes are **perpendicular** to the intended axis of rotation.

  When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
  [Roblox Units](../../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
  compare to metric units.

  #### Damping

  The `Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Damping|Damping` value controls how fast
  the spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to
  oscillate endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more
  quickly.

  #### Stiffness

  `Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Stiffness|Stiffness` sets the torsional
  strength of the spring. Higher values create a spring that responds with more
  force.

  #### Limits

  Enabling the `Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled`
  property exposes the `Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.MaxAngle|MaxAngle` value
  to restrict the spring's range within a cone; it also exposes the
  `Class.TorsionSpringConstraint.Restitution|Restitution` value which defines
  the elasticity of the attachments when they reach their limit.

  - name: TorsionSpringConstraint.Stiffness
    summary: |
      The torsional stiffness of the spring.
    description: |
      In the absence of damping, this property is proportional to the opposing
      torque of the spring. For instance, higher stiffness results in a larger
      opposing torque, and smaller stiffness results in a smaller opposing
      torque. The larger the torque value, the faster the axes are pushed
      together when the relative angle is positive (or away from each other if
      the relative angle is negative). The value defaults to 100.
