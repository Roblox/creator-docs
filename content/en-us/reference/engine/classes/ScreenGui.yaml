  Primary container of on-screen 2D user interface elements.
description: |
  The main storage object for 2D `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` displayed on the
  user's screen. A `Class.ScreenGui` only shows if parented to a player's
  `Class.PlayerGui`; parenting a `Class.ScreenGui` to `Class.StarterGui` ensures
  it clones into each player's `Class.PlayerGui` when they join the experience.

  For performance improvements, the appearance of a `Class.ScreenGui` is cached
  until one of the following events occurs:

  - A descendant is added to or removed from it.
  - A property of a descendant changes.
  - A property of the `Class.ScreenGui` itself changes.

  If any of these events occur, the `Class.ScreenGui` appearance is recomputed
  on the next frame it gets rendered.

      Whether to clip the contents of this `Class.ScreenGui` to the device's
      safe area.
    description: |
      If this property is `true`, all `Class.GuiObject` descendants of this
      `Class.ScreenGui` will be clipped to the device's safe area (see
      `Enum.ScreenInsets`). The default is `true` to maintain backwards
      compatibility of UI that is intentionally hidden offscreen, such as
      objects that slide into view from a screen edge when they're needed.

      area" />
      <figcaption>When set to <code>true</code>, UI objects are clipped
      by the device's safe area</figcaption>
      </figure>

      If this property is `false`, `Class.GuiObject` descendants will **not** be
      clipped to the device's safe area and may be obscured by the camera notch
      or other screen cutouts.

      area, obscured by screen camera notch" />
      <figcaption>When set to <code>false</code>, UI objects may overflow the
      safe area and become obscured</figcaption>
      </figure>

      Note that this property will be ignored if you set
      `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets` to `Enum.ScreenInsets|None`, as doing so
      implies that you intentionally want to disregard the device's safe insets.

      Determines whether this `Class.ScreenGui` overflows into the range of
      Roblox's core UI elements.
    description: |
      If this property is `false` (default),
      `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` is set to
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets`, effectively keeping its bounds below
      the Roblox top bar core UI.

      If this property is changed to `true` and
      `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` is currently set to
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets`,
      `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` will be set to
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|DeviceSafeInsets`.

      See `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` for details on how screen
      insets affect the contents of a `Class.ScreenGui`.

      Specifies whether automatic UI compatibility transformations are applied

      screen cutouts.
    description: |
      This property specifies whether automatic UI compatibility transformations
      are applied to descendant "fullscreen" `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` of
      this `Class.ScreenGui` on displays with screen cutouts. Eligibility occurs
      if the total area of the descendant `Class.GuiObject` (including any
      applied border or `Class.UIStroke`) covers the device's safe area both
      horizontally and vertically. See the `Enum.SafeAreaCompatibility` enum
      reference for details.

      The default value is `Enum.SafeAreaCompatibility|FullscreenExtension` in
      order to automatically improve the appearance of UI that was authored for
      screens without any cutouts. However, it's recommended that you avoid
      fullscreen extensions for new work; instead, use the
      `Class.ScreenGui.ScreenInsets|ScreenInsets` property to specify which
      insets should be respected for different `Class.ScreenGui|ScreenGuis`.

      Note that descendant UI objects will continue to be clipped by the
      device's safe area if
      `Class.ScreenGui.ClipToDeviceSafeArea|ClipToDeviceSafeArea` is set to
      `true`.

    description: |
      This property controls the safe area insets that are applied to the
      contents of this `Class.ScreenGui`. The default of
      `Enum.ScreenInsets|CoreUISafeInsets` keeps all descendant
      `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` inside the core UI safe area, clear of the
      Roblox top bar buttons and other screen cutouts like the device's camera
      notch. This setting is recommended for any `Class.ScreenGui` containing
      interactive and/or important UI elements such as buttons and status
      messages.

      width="840" alt="Mobile device showing UI buttons inside core UI safe area" />

      If you set this property to `Enum.ScreenInsets|None`, UI objects may be
      obscured behind core UI objects or device cutouts like the camera notch.
      As such, you should only use `Enum.ScreenInsets|None` for a
      `Class.ScreenGui` that contains noninteractive content like background
      images.

      If you set this property to `Enum.ScreenInsets|TopbarSafeInsets`, all
      descendant `Class.GuiObject|GuiObjects` will be kept between the Roblox
      left-most controls and the edge of the device safe area. This
      `Class.ScreenGui` will then automatically adjust its size and position
      based on control visibility/size to avoid UI collisions.
