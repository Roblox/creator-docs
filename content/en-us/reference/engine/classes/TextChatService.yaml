  `Class.TextChannel|managing channels`, decorating messages, filtering text,
  `Class.TextChatCommand|creating commands`, and
  [developing custom chats interfaces](../../../chat/examples/simple-custom-frontend-ui.md).

      Each of the default channels has the described special behavior applied to
      messages using its internally bound `Class.TextChannel.OnIncomingMessage`
      callback function, changing how messages appear when sent through the
      channel. The callback is assigned automatically either at runtime (if the

      Messages from different TextChannels can be separated into different tabs

    description: |
      Determines whether a user has permission to chat directly with other users
      in experiences based on their parental control settings. To be used when:

      - The line of communication is user-initiated (not developer- or
        gameplay-initiated)
      - Access to the communication is closed and limited

      An example of a direct chat is a whisper channel between two users.

      You may use this method to gate certain features in your experience
      depending on the result.

      When creating a `Class.TextChannel` for a direct chat, use
      `Class.TextChannel:SetDirectChatRequester` to set the requesterUserId so
      that the channel can determine whether to deliver messages between users.
      When `Class.TextChannel.DirectChatRequester` is non-nil,
      `Class.TextChannel|TextChannels` internally use this result to determine
      whether to deliver messages between users.

      ```lua
      local whoCanDirectChat = TextChatService:CanUsersDirectChatAsync(requesterUserId, { userId1, userId2 })

      if #whoCanDirectChat > 0 then
        -- The requesterUserId can direct chat with either userId1, userId2, or both
      else
        -- The requesterUserId cannot direct chat with either userId1 or userId2
      end
      ```

      Note that this method is only available for use in a `Class.Script` with
      `Class.Script.RunContext|RunContext` of `Enum.RunContext.Server` or
      `Enum.RunContext.Legacy`.

      Returns chat group IDs that indicate which players can synchronously text

    description: |
      Returns a sorted array of arrays of chat group IDs for the given players.
      Each chat group ID is a string that represents a communication-compatible
      group within the current universe.

      If two or more players share the same chat group ID, those players are
      able to synchronously text chat with each other based on their age-check
      status and chat settings.

      This method is server-side only and intended for real-time use cases such
      as matchmaking and teleporting. Chat group IDs are unique to the current
      universe, may change over time, and should not be stored once the user has
      left the experience. While you can hold onto the data returned for the
      purposes of gameplay while the user is in the experience, this data should
      not be stored after they've left.

      To use this method, you must enable **Chat & Voice Groups APIs** in
      **Experience Settings** ⟩ **Communication** in Roblox Studio and agree to
      the Roblox Terms of Use.

      ```lua
      local TextChatService = game:GetService("TextChatService")
      local Players = game:GetService("Players")
      local players = Players:GetPlayers()

      while waiting for server response to `Class.TextChannel:SendAsync()`.

      Called when a bubble chat is about to be displayed. This can only be
      implemented on the client.

      Use this to customize individual bubble chat messages. If this callback
      returns a `Class.BubbleChatMessageProperties`, those properties will be
      applied to the associated bubble, overriding
      `Class.BubbleChatConfiguration` properties. If a `Class.UICorner`,
      `Class.UIGradient`, or `Class.ImageLabel` is parented under
      `Class.BubbleChatMessageProperties`, they will also override their
      respective counterparts defined in `Class.BubbleChatConfiguration`.

      If the chat message is sent by a player, `message.TextSource` will
      correspond to that player, and `adornee` will be `nil`.

      If the chat message is sent via `Class.TextChatService:DisplayBubble`,
      `adornee` will be the `partOrCharacter` provided, and `message.TextSource`
      will be `nil`.

      When bound to the client sending a message, this callback is run twice:
      first when the message is initially sent and received locally, then again
      when the client receives the result of the filtered message from the
      server.

      Called when a new message is about to be displayed in the chat window.
      This can only be implemented on the client.

      Use this to customize individual messages that appear in the chat window.
      If this callback returns a `Class.ChatWindowMessageProperties`, those
      properties will be applied to the associated message, overriding
      `Class.ChatWindowConfiguration` properties. If a `Class.UIGradient` is
      parented under `Class.ChatWindowMessageProperties`, it will also override
      the `Class.ChatWindowConfiguration.TextColor3|TextColor3` property defined
      in `Class.ChatWindowConfiguration`.

      When bound to the client sending a message, this callback is run twice:

      Called when `Class.TextChatService` is receiving an incoming message. Can
      only be implemented on the client.

      Use this to decorate `Class.TextChatMessage|TextChatMessages`. If this
      callback returns a `Class.TextChatMessageProperties`, those properties are
      merged with the `Class.TextChatMessage` parameter to create a new
      `Class.TextChatMessage`.

      When bound to the client sending a message, this callback is run twice;
      first when the message is initially sent and received locally, and again
      when the client receives the result of the filtered message from the
      server.

      Note that this `Class.TextChatService.OnIncomingMessage` callback runs
      **before** any `Class.TextChannel.OnIncomingMessage` callbacks.

      This should be defined only once in the source code. Multiple bindings
      will override one another in a non‑deterministic manner.
