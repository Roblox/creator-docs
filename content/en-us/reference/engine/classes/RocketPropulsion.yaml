memory_category: Instances
summary: |
  Applies a force so that an assembly follows and faces a target part.
description: |
  The `RocketPropulsion` object applies force on an assembly so that it both
  **follows** and **faces** a target. It acts like a hybrid of
  `Class.BodyPosition` and `Class.BodyGyro`. Unlike other
  `Class.BodyMover|BodyMovers`, `RocketPropulsion` must be instructed to begin
  applying or stopping force via `Class.RocketPropulsion:Fire()|Fire()` or
  `Class.RocketPropulsion:Abort()|Abort()` respectively.

  You can detect when the assembly reaches its target using the
  `Class.RocketPropulsion.ReachedTarget|ReachedTarget` event which fires once
  the assembly is within the `Class.RocketPropulsion.TargetRadius|TargetRadius`
  of the `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target` part.

      This property determines the tendency of the assembly to face the
      `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`. By default, this property is set
      to `0.7`. If set to `0`, the assembly will make no effort to face the
      target.

    description: |
      This property determines the upper limit of the thrust that may be exerted
      to move the assembly. Assemblies that have high mass will require more
      thrust in order to remain airborne and thus track the
      `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`.

    description: |
      This property determines the world offset from the
      `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`. It is especially useful when
      `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target` is set to `nil`, since this
      property then acts as the target position.

      This property is used to dampen the velocity of the assembly in order to
      prevent it from overshooting the `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`
      and causing a "rubber‑banding" effect. It behaves similarly to
      `Class.BodyPosition.D`.

      This property determines how much power is used while applying force in
      order to reach the `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target` position. The
      higher this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be
      used. This property works similarly to `Class.BodyPosition.P`.

    summary: |
      Determines the amount of dampening that to use in reaching the
      `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`.
    description: |
      This property specifies how much dampening will be applied to the torque
      used to face the `Class.RocketPropulsion.Target|Target`. When the assembly
      approaches the goal orientation, it needs to decelerate, otherwise it will
      rotate past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate back toward the
      goal. This often creates an undesirable "rubber‑banding" effect, avoided
      by applying dampening. The higher this value is set, the greater the
      dampening curve becomes, or the slower the part will approach the goal
      orientation.
