**Build logic into your experiences with Roblox Engine APIs.**

This API Reference documents all of the classes, data types, enumerations,
functions, events, callbacks, and properties that you can use when
creating on Roblox.

## Classes

Classes represent core objects and services in the Roblox engine. They contain
properties, methods, events, and callbacks.

are native to Lua while Roblox globals are found only on Roblox.

types.
