# Engine reference

The Roblox Engine reference at [https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine) is built from a set of internal files.

- We provide the generated YAML files in these directories so that you can view the source or use them in your own projects.
- Because these YAML files are generated, we don't accept pull requests on them.
