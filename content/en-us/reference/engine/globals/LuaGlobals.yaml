  The following is a list of functions and variables that are native to Luau.
  These functions can be used in a standard installation of both
  [Luau](https://luau.org) and [Lua 5.1.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/),
  though there are some differences in how some of these work on Roblox.

      Throws an error if the provided `value` is `false` or `nil`. If the
      assertion passes, it returns all values passed to it.

      ```lua

      Performs the specified operation of the garbage collector.
    description: |
      Performs the specified operation of the garbage collector. Note that
      Roblox's Luau sandbox only allows the `count` option to be used (the total
      memory in use by Luau, in kilobytes), as other options can interfere with
      existing processes. Effectively, this makes `Global.LuaGlobals.gcinfo()` a
      superior alternative that should be used instead.
    parameters:
      - name: operation
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          The name of the operation that should be performed by the garbage

  - name: error
    summary: |
      Halts thread execution and throws an error.
    description: |
      Terminates the last protected function called and outputs `message` as an
      error message. If the function containing the error is not called in a
      protected function such as `pcall()`, then the script which called the
      function will terminate. The error function itself never returns and acts
      like a script error.

      The `level` argument specifies how to get the error position. With level
      `1` (the default), the error position is where the error function was
      called. Level 2 points the error to where the function that called error
      was called; and so on. Passing a level `0` avoids the addition of error
      position information to the message.
    parameters:
      - name: message
        type: Variant
        default:
        summary: |
          The error message to display.
      - name: level

      Returns the current environment in use by the caller, as a dictionary.

      - If provided with a function, the environment of the function will be
        returned.
      - If provided with an integer, `Global.LuaGlobals.getfenv()` will provide
        the environment of the function at the provided stack level: Level 1 is
        the function calling `Global.LuaGlobals.getfenv()`. If `stack` is `0`,
        `Global.LuaGlobals.getfenv()` returns the global environment of the
        current script. When using `Global.LuaGlobals.getfenv()` to get the
        current environment of a script, it will return the same table every
        time within the specific thread.

      **WARNING:** This function allows uncontrolled change of the
      global/function environment and disables script optimizations. Changes to
      the environment are not tracked by the script analysis tooling and may
      result in missing or incorrect warnings. As a replacement, consider using
      `Library.debug.info()` instead.

      Returns the metatable of the given table `t` if it has one, otherwise
      returns `nil`. If `t` does have a metatable, and the `__metatable`
      metamethod is set, it returns that value instead.

      ```lua

      Returns an iterator function and the table for use in a for loop.
    description: |
      Returns three values: an iterator function, the table `t` and the number
      `0`. Each time the iterator function is called, it returns the next
      numerical index-value pair in the table. When used in a generic for-loop,
      the return values can be used to iterate over each numerical index in the
      table:

      ```lua
      local fruits = {"apples", "oranges", "kiwi"}
      for index, fruit in ipairs(fruits) do

  - name: loadstring
    summary: |
      Returns the provided code as a function that can be executed.
    description: |
      Loads Luau code from a string and returns it as a function.

      Unlike standard Lua 5.1, Roblox's Luau cannot load the compiled bytecode
      using `loadstring()`.

      `loadstring()` is disabled by default. For guidance around enabling it,
      see `Class.ServerScriptService`.

      **WARNING:** This method disables certain Luau optimizations on the
      returned function. Extreme caution should be taken when using
      `Global.LuaGlobals.loadstring()`; if your intention is to allow users to
      run code in your experience, make sure to protect the returned function's
      environment by using `Global.LuaGlobals.getfenv()` and
      `Global.LuaGlobals.setfenv()`.
    parameters:
      - name: contents
        type: string
        default:
        summary: |
          The specified string to be loaded as Luau code.

  - name: next
    summary: |
      An iterator function for use in for loops.
    description: |
      Returns the first key/value pair in the array. If a `lastKey` argument was
      specified then returns the next element in the array based on the key that
      provided. The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified,
      even for numeric indices. To traverse a table in numeric order, use a
      numerical for loop or `ipairs`.

      The behavior of next is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign any
      value to a non-existent field in the table. You may, however, modify
      existing fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.

    description: |
      Returns an iterator function, the passed table `t`, and `nil`, so that the
      construction will iterate over all key/value pairs of that table when used

      Runs the provided function and catches any error it throws, returning the
      function's success and its results.
    description: |
      Calls the function `func` with the given arguments in protected mode. This
      means that any error inside `func` is not propagated; instead, `pcall()`
      catches the error and returns a status code. Its first result is the
      status code (a boolean), which is true if the call succeeds without
      errors. In such case, `pcall()` also returns all results from the call,
      after this first result. In case of any error, `pcall()` returns false
      plus the error message.

      ```lua
      local function divideByFive(n: number): number
      	return n / 5
      end

      local success, errorMessage = pcall(divideByFive, "notANumber")  -- Results in error...

    description: |
      Receives any number of arguments, and prints their values to the output.
      `print` is not intended for formatted output, but only as a quick way to
      show a value, typically for debugging. For a formatted output, use
      `Library.string.format()`. On Roblox, `print` does not call `tostring`,
      but the `__tostring` metamethod still fires if the table has one.
    parameters:

  - name: require
    summary: |
      Returns the value that was returned by the given ModuleScript, running it
      if it has not been run yet.
    description: |
      Runs the supplied `Class.ModuleScript` and returns what the
      `Class.ModuleScript` returned (usually a table or a function). If the
      `Class.ModuleScript` has not been run yet, it will be executed.

      If a string path is provided instead, it is first resolved to a
      `Class.ModuleScript` relative to the script that called
      `Global.LuaGlobals.require()`, mimicking the Unix-like semantics of Luau's
      `require()` expression.

      Specifically, require-by-string's resolution semantics are as follows:

      - Paths with the `./` prefix begin resolution at `script.Parent`.
      - Paths with the `../` prefix begin resolution at `script.Parent.Parent`.
      - Paths with the `@self/` prefix begin resolution at `script`.
      - Paths with the `@game/` prefix begin resolution at `game`.
      - Each non-prefix component in a given path corresponds to a child
        instance of the previous component. The exception to this is the `..`
        component, which corresponds to the parent of the previous component.
      - If the desired `Class.ModuleScript` is not present at the time that
        `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` is called, the call will fail and throw an
        error. In other words, require-by-string is non-blocking: it does not
        implicitly wait for a `Class.ModuleScript` to be created.

      To illustrate this, each pair of `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` expressions
      in the example below contains two functionally equivalent calls. Redundant
      parentheses have been added to clarify exactly how each path component
      maps onto an instance.

      ```lua
      -- "./" prefix is equivalent to script.Parent
      require("./MySibling")
      require((script.Parent).(MySibling))

      -- "../" prefix is equivalent to script.Parent.Parent
      require("../SiblingOfMyParent")
      require((script.Parent.Parent).(SiblingOfMyParent))

      -- "../" can be chained to go up multiple levels
      require("../../SiblingOfMyGrandparent")
      require((script.Parent.Parent).(Parent).(SiblingOfMyGrandparent))

      -- "@self" prefix corresponds to the script itself
      require("@self/MyChild")
      require((script).(MyChild))

      -- "@game" prefix corresponds to the DataModel root
      require("@game/ReplicatedStorage/Shared/MyModule")
      require((game).(ReplicatedStorage).(Shared).(MyModule))
      ```

      Once the return object is created by an **initial**
      `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` call of a `Class.ModuleScript`, future
      `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` calls for the same `Class.ModuleScript` (on
      the same side of the client-server boundary) will not run the code again.
      Instead, a reference to the **same** return object created by the initial
      `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` call will be supplied. This behavior allows
      for the sharing of values across different scripts, as multiple
      `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` calls from different scripts will reference
      the same returned object. If the returned object is a table, any values
      stored within the table are shared and accessible by any script requiring
      that `Class.ModuleScript`.

      As noted above, the "object sharing" behavior does not cross the
      client-server boundary. This means that if a `Class.ModuleScript` is
      accessible to both the client **and** server (such as by being placed in
      `Class.ReplicatedStorage`) and `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` is called
      from both a `Class.LocalScript` as well as a `Class.Script`, the code in
      the `Class.ModuleScript` will be run twice, and the `Class.LocalScript`
      will receive a distinct return object from the one received by the
      `Class.Script`.

      Also note that if the `Class.ModuleScript` the user wants to run has been
      uploaded to Roblox (with the instance's name being `MainModule`), it can
      be loaded by using the `Global.LuaGlobals.require()` function on the asset
      ID of the `Class.ModuleScript`, though only on the server.

      print(select(-1, "A", "B", "C")) --> C
      ```

      If the `index` argument is set to `"#"`, the number of arguments that were
      passed after it is returned.

    description: |
      Sets the environment to be used by the given function. `f` can be a
      function or a number that specifies the function at that stack level:
      Level 1 is the function calling `setfenv()`. `setfenv()` returns the given
      function.

      If `f` is `0`, then `setfenv()` changes the environment of the running
      thread and returns no values.

      **WARNING:** This function allows uncontrolled change of the
      global/function environment and disables script optimizations. Changes to
      the environment are not tracked by the script analysis tooling and may
      result in missing or incorrect warnings.

    summary: |
      Returns the provided value converted to a number, or `nil` if impossible.
    description: |
      Attempts to convert the arg into a number with a specified base to
      interpret the value in. If it cannot be converted, this function returns
      `nil`.

      The base may be any integer between 2 and 36, inclusive. In bases above
      10, the letter 'A' (in either upper or lower case) represents 10, 'B'
      represents 11, and so forth, with 'Z' representing 35. In base 10 (the
      default), the number may have a decimal part, as well as an optional
      exponent part. In other bases, only unsigned integers are accepted.

      If a string begins with `0x` and a base is not provided, the `0x` is
      trimmed and the base is assumed to be 16, or hexadecimal.

      ```lua
      print(tonumber("1337")) --> 1337 (assumes base 10, decimal)
      print(tonumber("1.25")) --> 1.25 (base 10 may have decimal portions)
      print(tonumber("3e2")) --> 300 (base 10 may have exponent portion, 3 &times; 10 ^ 2)
      print(tonumber("25", 8)) --> 21 (base 8, octal)
      print(tonumber("0x100")) --> 256 (assumes base 16, hexadecimal)
      print(tonumber("roblox")) --> nil (does not raise an error)
      -- Tip: use with assert if you would like unconvertable numbers to raise an error
      print(assert(tonumber("roblox"))) --> Error: assertion failed

      it will be called with `e` as the only argument and will return the

    summary: |
      Similar to `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` except it uses a custom error
      handler.
    description: |
      This function is similar to `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()`, except that you
      can set a new error handler.

      `xpcall()` calls function `f` in protected mode, using `err` as the error
      handler, and passes a list of arguments. Any error inside `f` is not
      propagated; instead, `xpcall()` catches the error, calls the `err`
      function with the original error object, and returns a status code. Its
      first result is the status code (a boolean), which is true if the call
      succeeds without errors. In this case, `xpcall()` also returns all results
      from the call, after this first result. In case of any error, `xpcall()`
      returns false plus the result from `err`.

      Unlike `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()`, the `err` function preserves the stack
      trace of function `f`, which can be inspected using `Library.debug.info()`
      or `Library.debug.traceback()`.
    parameters:
      - name: f
        type: function
