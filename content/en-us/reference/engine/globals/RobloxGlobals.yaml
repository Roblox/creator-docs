    type: Plugin
    summary: |
      Refers to a Plugin singleton when the code is run in the context of a
      Studio plugin.
    description: |
      A reference to the `Class.Plugin` object that represents the plugin being
      run from this `Class.Script`. This reference exists only in the context
      where a script is executed as a plugin and is not passed to
      `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` within the plugin. To use this
      reference in a `Class.ModuleScript`, you must explicitly pass it.

      ```lua
      assert(plugin, "This script must be run as a plugin!")
      -- Code beyond this point will execute only if the script is run as a plugin
      ```

      Schedules a function to be called on the next Heartbeat after the given
      duration (in seconds) has passed, with throttling.
    description: |
      Schedules a function to be executed after `delayTime` seconds have passed,
      without yielding the current thread. This function allows multiple Luau
      threads to be executed in parallel from the same stack. The delay will
      have a minimum duration of 29 milliseconds, but this minimum may be higher
      depending on the target framerate and various throttling conditions. If
      the `delayTime` parameter is not specified, the minimum duration will be
      used.
    parameters:
      - name: delayTime
        type: number
        default:
        summary: |
          The amount of time that this function will be queued before being
          executed.
      - name: callback
        type: function
        default:

      has been running for.
    description: |

  - name: spawn
    summary: |
      Calls a function immediately through the engine scheduler, with
      throttling.
    description: |
      Runs the specified callback function in a separate thread, without
      yielding the current thread.

      The function will be executed the next time Roblox's Task Scheduler runs
      an update cycle. This delay will take at least 29 milliseconds but can
      arbitrarily take longer, depending on the target framerate and various
      throttling conditions.

      The callback function is invoked with two arguments:

      1. The first being the amount of time which elapsed from when spawn was
         called to when the function was invoked.
      2. The second being equivalent to elapsedTime() or roughly how long the
         engine has been running.

      ```lua
      spawn(print) -- 0.0079617658390703 451.55683163643

    summary: |
      Returns the amount of time in seconds since the Unix epoch according to
      this device's time.
    description: |
      Returns how much time has elapsed, in seconds, since the Unix epoch, on
      the current local session's computer. The Unix epoch is represented by
      00:00:00 on 1 January 1970.

      `tick()` isn't officially deprecated, but has a variety of issues. It can
      be off by up to one second and returns inconsistent results across time
      zones and operating systems. Use `Library.os.time()`,
      `Library.os.clock()`, or `Global.RobloxGlobals.time()` instead. Also
      consider `Datatype.DateTime.UnixTimestamp` and
      `Datatype.DateTime.UnixTimestampMillis`.

      Returns the amount of time, in seconds, that has elapsed since the current
      game instance started running. If the current game instance is not
      running, this will be `0`.

      If `Class.Workspace.AuthorityMode` is `Enum.AuthorityMode.Server`, this
      value is synchronized between client and server.

    description: |

      The delay will have a minimum duration of 29 milliseconds, but this
      minimum may be higher depending on the target framerate and various
      throttling conditions. If the `seconds` parameter is not specified, the
      minimum duration will be used. This function returns:

      - Actual time yielded (in seconds).
