  Roblox has several unique built-in functions and variables in its Lua
  implementation. These are only found on Roblox and are not packaged by default
  with Lua.

      Studio plugin.
    description: |
      A reference to the `Class.Plugin` object that represents the plugin being

      A table shared between all code running at the same execution context
      level.

    summary: |
      A reference to the LuaSourceContainer object (Script, LocalScript, or
      ModuleScript) that is executing this code.
    description: |
      A reference to the script object that is executing the code you are
      writing. It can be either a `Class.Script`, a `Class.LocalScript`, or a
      `Class.ModuleScript` (and sometimes a `Class.CoreScript`). This variable
      is not available when executing code from Roblox Studio's command bar.

functions:
  - name: delay
    summary: |
      Schedules a function to be called on the next Heartbeat after the given
      duration (in seconds) has passed, with throttling.
    description: |
      Schedules a function to be executed after `delayTime` seconds have passed,
      without yielding the current thread. This function allows multiple Lua
      threads to be executed in parallel from the same stack. The delay will
      have a minimum duration of 29 milliseconds, but this minimum may be higher
      depending on the target framerate and various throttling conditions. If
      the `delayTime` parameter is not specified, the minimum duration will be
      used.
    parameters:
      - name: delayTime
        type: number
        default:
        summary: |
          The amount of time that this function will be queued before being
          executed.
      - name: callback
        type: function
        default:
        summary: |
          The function that will be executed once `delayTime` seconds have
          passed.

      has been running for.
    description: |

      started. In Roblox Studio, this begins counting up from the moment Roblox
      Studio starts running, not just when opening a place.

      required to create plugins.
    description: |
      Returns the `Class.PluginManager` which is a deprecated singleton that was
      previously required to create plugins. It still has applicable uses, such
      as if you need to create a Plugin object from Roblox Studio's command bar.

    code_samples:
  - name: require
    summary: |
      Returns the value that was returned by the given ModuleScript, running it
      if it has not been run yet.
    description: |
      Runs the supplied `Class.ModuleScript` and returns what the
      `Class.ModuleScript` returned (usually a table or a function). Once the
      return object is created by an **initial**
      `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` call of a `Class.ModuleScript`, future
      `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` calls for the same `Class.ModuleScript`
      (on the same side of the client-server boundary) will not run the code
      again. Instead, a reference to the **same** return object created by the
      initial `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` call will be supplied. This
      behavior allows for the sharing of values across different scripts, as
      multiple `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` calls from different scripts
      will reference the same returned object. If the returned object is a
      table, any values stored within the table are shared and accessible by any
      script requiring that `Class.ModuleScript`.

      As noted above, the "object sharing" behavior does not cross the
      client-server boundary. This means that if a `Class.ModuleScript` is
      accessible to both the client **and** server (such as by being placed in
      `Class.ReplicatedStorage`) and `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` is called
      from both a `Class.LocalScript` as well as a `Class.Script`, the code in
      the `Class.ModuleScript` will be run twice, and the `Class.LocalScript`
      will receive a distinct return object from the one received by the
      `Class.Script`.

      Also note that if the `Class.ModuleScript` the user wants to run has been
      uploaded to Roblox (with the instance's name being `MainModule`), it can
      be loaded by using the `Global.RobloxGlobals.require()` function on the
      asset ID of the `Class.ModuleScript`, though only on the server.
    parameters:
      - name: module
        type: ModuleScript
        default:
        summary: |
          The `Class.ModuleScript` that will be executed to retrieve the return
          value it provides.
    returns:
      - type: Variant
        summary: |

          function).

    code_samples:
  - name: spawn
    summary: |
      Calls a function immediately through the engine scheduler, with
      throttling.
    description: |
      Runs the specified callback function in a separate thread, without
      yielding the current thread.

      The function will be executed the next time Roblox's Task Scheduler runs
      an update cycle. This delay will take at least 29 milliseconds but can
      arbitrarily take longer, depending on the target framerate and various
      throttling conditions.

      The callback function is invoked with two arguments:

      1. The first being the amount of time which elapsed from when spawn was
         called to when the function was invoked.
      2. The second being equivalent to elapsedTime() or roughly how long the
         engine has been running.

      spawn(print) -- 0.0079617658390703 451.55683163643

      Roblox-specific types (e.g. Vector3).
    description: |
      Returns the type of the object specified, as a string. This function is
      more accurate than Lua's native `type` function, as it does not denote
      Roblox-specific types as `userdata`.

        type: Variant
        default:

      elapsed.

      The delay will have a minimum duration of 29 milliseconds, but this
      minimum may be higher depending on the target framerate and various
