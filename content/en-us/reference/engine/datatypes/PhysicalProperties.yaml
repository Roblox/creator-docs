summary: |
  Describes properties that affect the physical behavior of a `Class.BasePart`.
description: |
  The `Datatype.PhysicalProperties` data type describes several physical
  properties of a `Class.BasePart`:
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Density|Density`,
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Elasticity|Elasticity`, and
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Friction|Friction`. It is used in the
  similarly-named `Class.BasePart.CustomPhysicalProperties|` property.

  #### Weighting Behavior

  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties` also provides weightings properties,
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.ElasticityWeight|ElasticityWeight` and
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight`. When two parts
  interact, the friction and elasticity between them are determined in the same
  way by the following pairwise weighted average function:

  ![(Friction_a * FrictionWeight_a + Friction_b * FrictionWeight_b) / (FrictionWeight_a + FrictionWeight_b)](/assets/legacy/FrictionWeight.png)

  Although the formula above refers to the
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Friction|Friction` and
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight` of two parts,
  **A** and **B**, the formula is used in the same manner when determining
  `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Elasticity|Elasticity`. Generally, when the
  weight of **A** is much greater than that of **B**, the actual value will be
  closer to **A**. If the weights are similar, the actual value will be close to
  the midpoint between their individual values.

      The mass per unit volume of the part.
    description: |
      Density is defined as the amount of mass per unit volume. The more dense a
      part is, the more force it takes to accelerate it. Acceptable range is
      0.01 to 100.0 and values outside this range will be clamped.

    summary: |
      The deceleration of the part when rubbing against another part.
    description: |
      Friction is defined as the force that opposes the relative lateral motion
      of two solid surfaces in contact. The greater the friction on a part, the
      quicker it will decelerate when it rubs against another part with
      friction. Acceptable range is 0.0 to 2.0 and values outside this range
      will be clamped.

    summary: |
      The amount of energy retained when colliding with another part.
    description: |
      Elasticity refers to a part's tendency to retain energy when colliding
      with another part. An `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Elasticity|Elasticity`
      of 1 indicates that the part bounces with the same energy it had before a
      collision. Acceptable range is 0.0 to 1.0 and values outside this range
      will be clamped.

      the friction with the colliding part.
    description: |
      The friction weight of two parts rubbing together creates a ratio used to
      calculate the actual friction between the two parts. The higher a part's
      `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.FrictionWeight|FrictionWeight`, the more its
      `Datatype.PhysicalProperties.Friction|Friction` is used. Acceptable range
      is 0.0 to 100.0 and values outside this range will be clamped.
