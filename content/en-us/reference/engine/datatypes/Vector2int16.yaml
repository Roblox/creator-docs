name: Vector2int16
type: datatype
summary: |
  Represents a Vector2 with signed 16-bit integers for components.
description: |
  The `Datatype.Vector2int16` data type represents a vector in 2D space with a
  **signed 16-bit integer** for its components. It is similar to
  `Datatype.Vector2` in that it allows for the same arithmetic operations, but
  it lacks commonly used vector functions.

  `Datatype.Vector2int16` should **not** be confused with:

  - `Datatype.Vector2`, a **more precise** and complete implementation for 2D
    vectors.
  - `Datatype.Vector3int16`, a similar implementation for 3D vectors.

  For each component:

  - The **lower** bound is -2<sup>15</sup>, or **-32,768**.
  - The **upper** bound is 2<sup>15</sup> &minus; 1, or **32,767**.

  #### Converting to Vector2

  To convert a `Datatype.Vector2int16` to a `Datatype.Vector2`, construct a
  `Datatype.Vector2` by passing each **component** of the
  `Datatype.Vector2int16` to `Datatype.Vector2.new()`:

  ```lua
  local vector2int16 = Vector2int16.new(1, 2)
  local vector2 = Vector2.new(vector2int16.X, vector2int16.Y)
  print(vector2)  --> 1, 2
  ```

  Do **not** pass an entire `Datatype.Vector2int16` to `Datatype.Vector2.new()`,
  as the constructor interprets a `Datatype.Vector2int16` as a `0` within its
  parameters **without producing an error**. This can lead to silent logic
  errors if you do something like:

  ```lua
  local vector2int16 = Vector2int16.new(1, 2)
  local vector2 = Vector2.new(vector2int16)
  print(vector2)  --> 0, 0
  ```

  #### Math Operations

  The following math operations are valid for the `Datatype.Vector2int16` data
  type. For all operations, be mindful of the bounds associated with signed
  16-bit integers, described earlier.

    summary: Returns a `Datatype.Vector2int16` from the given x and y components.
    description: |-
      Returns a new `Datatype.Vector2int16` given the x and y components. Non-integer
      components are rounded down.

      The components must fall within the range [-2<sup>15</sup>,
      2<sup>15</sup>).  If outside this range, integer
      overflow may occur. For
      example, providing 32,768 (equal to 2<sup>15</sup>) as a component
      overflows the 16-bit integer, and so the component is -32,768 (equal
      to -2<sup>15</sup>) instead.
