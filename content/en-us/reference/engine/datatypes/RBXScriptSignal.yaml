name: RBXScriptSignal
type: datatype
summary: |
  An object that runs connected functions upon a specific occurrence.
description: |
  The `Datatype.RBXScriptSignal` data type, more commonly known as an **Event**,
  provides a way for user-defined functions, called **listeners**, to call when
  something happens in the game. When an event happens, the
  `Datatype.RBXScriptSignal` fires and calls any listeners that are connected to
  it. An `Datatype.RBXScriptSignal` may also pass arguments to each listener to
  provide extra information about the event.

methods:
  - name: RBXScriptSignal:Connect
    summary: |
      Connects the given function to the event and returns an
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` that represents it.
    description: |
      Establishes a function to be called when the event fires. Returns a
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` object associated with the connection.
    parameters:
      - name: func

  - name: RBXScriptSignal:ConnectParallel
    summary: |
      Connects the given function to the event and returns an
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` that represents it.
    description: |
      Establishes a function to be called when the event fires. Returns a
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` object associated with the connection. When
      the event fires, the signal callback is executed in a desynchronized
      state. Using `ConnectParallel` is similar to, but more efficient than,
      using `Connect` followed by a call to `Library.task.desynchronize()` in
      the signal handler.

      Note: Scripts that connect in parallel must be rooted under an Actor.

  - name: RBXScriptSignal:Once
    summary: |
      Connects the given function to the event (for a single invocation) and
      returns an `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` that represents it.
    description: |
      Establishes a function to be called when the event fires. Returns a
      `Datatype.RBXScriptConnection` object associated with the connection. The
      behavior of `Once` is similar to `Connect`. However, instead of allowing
      multiple events to be received by the specified function, only the first
      event will be delivered. Using `Once` also ensures that the connection to
      the function will be automatically disconnected prior the function being
      called.
