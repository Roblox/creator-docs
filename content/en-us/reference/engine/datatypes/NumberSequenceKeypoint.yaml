properties:
  - name: NumberSequenceKeypoint.Envelope
    type: number
    summary: |
      The amount of variance allowed from the value.
    description: |
      The amount of variance allowed from the value. For example, a value of 0.5
      with an envelope of 0.1 could compute to between 0.4 and 0.6 at runtime.
      The most common use case for this property is to randomize the size of
      particles (within the envelope) from a
      `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitter`.
