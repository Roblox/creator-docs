name: OverlapParams
type: datatype
summary: |
  Stores parameters used in boundary-querying functions.
description: |
  The `Datatype.OverlapParams` data type stores parameters for use with
  `Class.WorldRoot` boundary-querying functions, in particular
  `Class.WorldRoot:GetPartBoundsInBox()`,
  `Class.WorldRoot:GetPartBoundsInRadius()` and
  `Class.WorldRoot:GetPartsInPart()`. The
  `Datatype.OverlapParams.FilterDescendantsInstances` property stores an array
  of objects to use as either an inclusion or exclusion list based on the
  `Datatype.OverlapParams.FilterType` enum, and the
  `Datatype.OverlapParams.CollisionGroup` property can specify a collision group
  for the boundary query operation.

  Unlike most data types in Luau, you can change all of the members of
  `Datatype.OverlapParams` without creating a new object, allowing you to reuse
  the same object repeatedly.

    description: |-
      Returns a blank `Datatype.OverlapParams` object. Unlike other data type
      constructors, this constructor does not have any parameters, so you should
      set its properties appropriately.

      The maximum amount of parts to be returned by the query.

      The maximum amount of parts to be returned by the query. The default value

    type: string
    summary: |
      The collision group used for the operation.
    description: |
      Specifies a collision group for the operation. Parts in collision groups
      that are set to **not** collide with this group are ignored. If this
      property is omitted, the operation assumes the **Default** collision
      group.

    type: bool
    summary: |
      Determines whether the boundary-querying operation considers a part's
      `Class.BasePart.CanCollide` property value over its
      `Class.BasePart.CanQuery` value.
    description: |
      This property, if `true`, makes the boundary-querying operation use an
      intersected part's `Class.BasePart.CanCollide` value in favor of its
      `Class.BasePart.CanQuery` value when determining whether that part is
      included in the array of spatial query results.

      When enabled, the query will ignore all part collision properties and

    description: |
      When enabled, the query will ignore all part collision properties and
      perform a brute-force check on every part. This will negatively impact
      performance and should not be used in live experiences.

methods:

      Adds the instances provided to
      `Datatype.OverlapParams.FilterDescendantsInstances|FilterDescendantsInstances`.
    description: |
      For efficiency and simplicity, this method is the preferred way to add
      instances to the filter. It has the additional advantage that it allows
      `Datatype.OverlapParams.FilterDescendantsInstances|FilterDescendantsInstances`
      to be updated from a parallel context.
