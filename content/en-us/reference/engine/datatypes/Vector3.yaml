name: Vector3
type: datatype
summary: |
  Represents a 3D value with a direction and magnitude.
description: |
  The `Datatype.Vector3` data type represents a vector in 3D space, typically
  used as a point in 3D space or the dimensions of a rectangular prism.
  `Datatype.Vector3` supports basic component-based arithmetic operations (sum,
  difference, product, and quotient) and these operations can be applied on the
  left or right hand side to either another `Datatype.Vector3` or a number. It
  also features methods for common vector operations, such as
  `Datatype.Vector3:Cross()|Cross()` and `Datatype.Vector3:Dot()|Dot()`.

  Alternatively to `Datatype.Vector3`, consider using the methods and properties
  of the `Library.vector` library.

  Some example usages of `Datatype.Vector3` are the
  `Class.BasePart.Position|Position`, `Class.BasePart.Rotation|Rotation`, and
  `Class.BasePart.Size|Size` of parts, for example:

  ```lua
  local Workspace = game:GetService("Workspace")

  local part = Workspace.Part
  part.Position = part.Position + Vector3.new(5, 2, 10) -- Move part by (5, 2, 10)
  ```

  `Datatype.Vector3` is also commonly used when constructing more complex 3D
  data types such as `Datatype.CFrame`. Many of these data types' methods will
  use a `Datatype.Vector3` within their parameters, such as
  `Datatype.CFrame:PointToObjectSpace()`.
