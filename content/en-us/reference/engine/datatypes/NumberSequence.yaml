name: NumberSequence
type: datatype
summary: |
  A series of floats across a period of time.
description: |
  The `Datatype.NumberSequence` data type represents a series of number values
  from `0` to `1`. The number values are expressed using the
  `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` type. This type is used in properties such
  as `Class.ParticleEmitter.Size` and `Class.Beam.Transparency` to define a
  numerical change over time.

  #### Equality

  Two `Datatype.NumberSequence` objects are equivalent only if the values of
  their `Datatype.NumberSequenceKeypoint` are equivalent, even if both would
  result in similar graphs.

  #### Evaluation

  The `Datatype.NumberSequence` type does not have a built-in method for getting
  the value at a certain time/point because keypoints can have random envelopes.
  However, assuming the envelope values of your keypoints are all `0`, you can
  use the following function to evaluate at a specific time.

  ```lua
  local function evalNumberSequence(sequence: NumberSequence, time: number)
      -- If time is 0 or 1, return the first or last value respectively
      if time == 0 then
          return sequence.Keypoints[1].Value
      elseif time == 1 then
          return sequence.Keypoints[#sequence.Keypoints].Value
      end

      -- Otherwise, step through each sequential pair of keypoints
      for i = 1, #sequence.Keypoints - 1 do
          local currKeypoint = sequence.Keypoints[i]
          local nextKeypoint = sequence.Keypoints[i + 1]
          if time >= currKeypoint.Time and time < nextKeypoint.Time then
              -- Calculate how far alpha lies between the points
              local alpha = (time - currKeypoint.Time) / (nextKeypoint.Time - currKeypoint.Time)
              -- Return the value between the points using alpha
              return currKeypoint.Value + (nextKeypoint.Value - currKeypoint.Value) * alpha
          end
      end
  end

  local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new{
      NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 0),
      NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 1),
      NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 0),
  }

  print(evalNumberSequence(numberSequence, 0.65))  --> 0.7
