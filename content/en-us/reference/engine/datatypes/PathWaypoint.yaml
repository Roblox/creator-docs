name: PathWaypoint
type: datatype
summary: |
  A description of the steps required to reach the next waypoint in a path.
description: |
  The `Datatype.PathWaypoint` data type constructed by a
  `Enum.PathWaypointAction` action, `Datatype.Vector3` position, and
  `Library.string` label which is used by the `Class.PathfindingService` to
  create points along a generated path.

  The code block below constructs a `Datatype.PathWaypoint` variable with
  `Vector3.new(10, 10, 10)` as its position, `Enum.PathWaypointAction.Walk` as
  its action, and `Custom Label` as its label:

  ```lua
  local pos = Vector3.new(10, 10, 10)
  local waypoint = PathWaypoint.new(pos, Enum.PathWaypointAction.Walk, "Custom Label")
  ```

  PathWaypoint can also be constructed by passing position and action. Label
  property will be set to default as empty string.

  ```lua
  local pos = Vector3.new(10, 10, 10)
  local waypoint = PathWaypoint.new(pos, Enum.PathWaypointAction.Walk)
  ```

  ## Action

  The `Enum.PathWaypointAction|Action` describes the action to take in order to
  reach this PathWaypoint. It can be set to one of the following enum values:

  <table>
  	<thead>
  		<tr>
  			<th>Name</th>
  			<th>Value</th>
  			<th>Description</th>
  		</tr>
  	</thead>
  	<tbody>
  		<tr>
  			<td>
  				Walk
  			</td>
  			<td>0</td>
  			<td>
  				Walk action needed to reach this waypoint from the previous one.
  			</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td>
  				Jump
  			</td>
  			<td>1</td>
  			<td>
  				Jump action needed to reach this waypoint from the previous one.
  			</td>
  		</tr>
  	</tbody>
  </table>
