A **debounce** pattern is a coding technique that prevents a function from running too many times or an input from triggering multiple times. The following scripting scenarios illustrate debounce as a best practice.

## Detecting Collisions

Suppose you want to create a hazardous trap part that inflicts 10 damage when touched. An initial implementation might use a basic `Class.BasePart.Touched` connection and a `damagePlayer` function like this:

```lua title='Script - Damage Player'
local part = script.Parent

local function damagePlayer(otherPart)
	print(part.Name .. " collided with " .. otherPart.Name)

	local humanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
	if humanoid then
		humanoid.Health -= 10  -- Reduce player health
	end
end

part.Touched:Connect(damagePlayer)
```

While logical at first glance, testing will show that the `Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched` event fires multiple times in quick succession based on subtle physical collisions.

To avoid causing excessive damage on initial contact, you can add a debounce system which enforces a cooldown period on damage through an [instance attribute](../studio/instance-attributes.md).

```lua title='Script - Damage Player Using Debounce' highlight='10, 11, 13, 14'
local part = script.Parent

local RESET_TIME = 1

local function damagePlayer(otherPart)
	print(part.Name .. " collided with " .. otherPart.Name)

	local humanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
	if humanoid then
		if not part:GetAttribute("Touched") then
			part:SetAttribute("Touched", true)  -- Set attribute to true
			humanoid.Health -= 10  -- Reduce player health
			task.wait(RESET_TIME)  -- Wait for reset duration
			part:SetAttribute("Touched", false)  -- Reset attribute
		end
	end
end

part.Touched:Connect(damagePlayer)
```

## Triggering Sounds

Debounce is also useful when working with sound effects, such as playing a sound when two parts collide (`Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched`), or playing a sound on the `Class.GuiButton.Activated|Activated` event when a user interacts with an on-screen button. In both cases, calling `Class.Sound:Play()` starts playback from the beginning of its track and&nbsp;&mdash; without a debounce system&nbsp;&mdash; the sound may play multiple times in quick succession.

To prevent sound overlap, you can debounce using the `Class.Sound.IsPlaying|IsPlaying` property of the `Class.Sound` object:

```lua title='Script - Play Collision Sound Using Debounce' highlight='5, 7-9'
local projectile = script.Parent

local function playSound()
	-- Find child sound on the part
	local sound = projectile:FindFirstChild("Impact")
	-- Play the sound only if it's not already playing
	if sound and not sound.IsPlaying then
		sound:Play()
	end
end

projectile.Touched:Connect(playSound)
```

```lua title='Script - Play Button Click Using Debounce' highlight='5, 7-9'
local button = script.Parent

local function onButtonActivated()
	-- Find child sound on the button
	local sound = button:FindFirstChild("Click")
	-- Play the sound only if it's not already playing
	if sound and not sound.IsPlaying then
		sound:Play()
	end
end

button.Activated:Connect(onButtonActivated)
```

## Pickup Effects

Experiences often include collectible pickups in the 3D world such as medi-kits, ammo packs, and more. If you design these pickups to remain in the world for players to grab again and again, a "cooldown" time should be added before the pickup refreshes and reactivates.

Similar to [detecting collisions](#detecting-collisions), you can manage the debounce state with an [instance attribute](../studio/instance-attributes.md), and visualize the cooldown period by changing the part's `Class.BasePart.Transparency|Transparency`.

```lua title='Script - Health Pickup Using Debounce' highlight='10, 11, 13, 15-17'
local part = script.Parent
part.Anchored = true
part.CanCollide = false

local COOLDOWN_TIME = 5

local function healPlayer(otherPart)
	local humanoid = otherPart.Parent:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
	if humanoid then
		if not part:GetAttribute("CoolingDown") then
			part:SetAttribute("CoolingDown", true)  -- Set attribute to true
			humanoid.Health += 25  -- Increase player health
			part.Transparency = 0.75  -- Make part semi-transparent to indicate cooldown state
			task.wait(COOLDOWN_TIME)  -- Wait for cooldown duration
			part.Transparency = 0  -- Reset part to fully opaque
			part:SetAttribute("CoolingDown", false)  -- Reset attribute
		end
	end
end

part.Touched:Connect(healPlayer)
```

This cooldown concept can be applied to other scenarios as well, such as creating a "reload" time for a rocket launcher to limit how frequently players can fire rockets.
