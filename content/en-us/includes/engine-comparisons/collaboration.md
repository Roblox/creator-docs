Roblox files live in the cloud (although you can export copies), so Roblox Studio provides built-in tools for much more collaborative work: **Team Create** for simultaneous editing, group management, permissions, script drafting, and more. See [Collaboration](projects/collaboration.md).

<Alert severity="info">
Cloud syncing provides further benefits with [packages](projects/assets/packages.md), the Roblox equivalent of {props.package}. Converting an asset or asset hierarchy to a package helps with local reusability, but also with collaboration. When you or your collaborators publish a new version of a package, you can quickly update existing instances of that package within an experience or set them to auto-update.
