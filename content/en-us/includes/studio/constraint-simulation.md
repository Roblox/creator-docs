To simulate physics while [moving](../../parts/index.md#move) or [rotating](../../parts/index.md#rotate) parts, you can switch from **Geometric** mode to **Physical** mode in Studio's toolbar, effectively forcing parts to obey physical limitations. For example, if two parts are attached by a `Class.RopeConstraint` and you drag one part around the scene, the other part will follow as the rope becomes taut.
