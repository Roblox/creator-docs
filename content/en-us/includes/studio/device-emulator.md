The **Device Emulator** lets you emulate various devices directly in Studio, providing insight into how controls work on mobile devices, consoles, and VR headsets, as well as how [on-screen UI](../../ui/on-screen-containers.md) elements display on different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.

In emulation mode, you can select devices from the **device selector** dropdown menu above the 3D viewport to emulate less powerful devices and test [streaming-enabled](../../workspace/streaming.md) experiences where 3D content dynamically loads and unloads based on available memory. You can also adjust the **view&nbsp;size** and change the **orientation** between landscape and portrait modes.
