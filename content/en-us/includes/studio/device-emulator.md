The **Device** emulator lets you emulate various devices directly in Studio, providing insight on how controls operate on a mobile device or how [on-screen UI](../../ui/on-screen-containers.md) displays on different screens and aspect ratios.

In emulation mode, you can select devices from the **Device Selector** dropdown menu above the 3D viewport to emulate less powerful devices and test [streaming-enabled](../../workspace/streaming.md) experiences where 3D content dynamically loads/unloads based on available memory. You can also adjust the **view&nbsp;size** and change the **device orientation** between landscape and portrait modes.
