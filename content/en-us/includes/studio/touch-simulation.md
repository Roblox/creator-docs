Touch simulation is automatically enabled when a mobile device is selected in the **Device Emulator**. Both single‑touch and two‑touch gestures can be simulated by clicking and dragging with the mouse while playtesting. By default, mouse interactions will simulate single‑touch gestures.

To start a two-touch gesture, use the following shortcuts:

- For pinch and rotate gestures, hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> (<kbd>⌥</kbd>) while dragging the mouse.
- For two-touch panning, hold <kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> (<kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>) while dragging the mouse.

When a two-touch shortcut is active, two circles will appear, indicating where the simulated touches are positioned.
