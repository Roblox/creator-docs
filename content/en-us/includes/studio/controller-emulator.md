The **Controller Emulator**, accessible from Studio's **Test** menu, lets you accurately emulate gamepad input directly in Studio. The default controller is a generic gamepad, but you can select alternatives from the upper‑left picker menu.

While playtesting, you can control the experience with the virtual controller using your mouse.

You can also click **Edit mappings** in the upper‑right corner to view and edit key mappings for the virtual controller, for example <kbd>E</kbd> to `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonL2|ButtonL2` or <kbd>9</kbd> to `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA|ButtonA`. These mappings are saved like other Studio settings (per controller, per user, per computer) and are translated to gamepad events in both the emulator window and the 3D viewport.
