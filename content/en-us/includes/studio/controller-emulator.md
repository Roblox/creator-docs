The **Controller Emulator** lets you accurately emulate gamepad input directly in Studio. The default controller is **Generic**, and you can select alternatives for Playstation, Xbox, and Quest devices from the upper‑left picker menu.

While playtesting, you can control the experience with the virtual controller using your mouse.

You can also click **Edit mappings** in the upper‑right corner to view and edit key mappings for the virtual controller, for example <kbd>E</kbd> to `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonL2|ButtonL2` or <kbd>9</kbd> to `Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA|ButtonA`. These mappings are saved like other Studio settings (per controller, per user, per computer) and are translated to gamepad events in both the emulator window and the 3D viewport.
