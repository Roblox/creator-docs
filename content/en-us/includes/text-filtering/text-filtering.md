Applied to various sources and inputs, [text filtering](../../ui/text-filtering.md) prevents users from seeing inappropriate language and personally identifiable information such as phone numbers. Roblox automatically filters common text outputs such as messages that have passed through [in-experience text chat](../../chat/in-experience-text-chat.md), but **you are responsible for filtering any displayed text that you don't have explicit control over**, including {props.context}.

<Alert severity="error">
Because filtering is crucial for a safe environment, Roblox actively moderates the content of experiences to make sure they meet [community standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards). If Roblox receives reports or automatically detects that your experience doesn't apply text filtering, then the system removes the experience until you add filtering.
