The Experience Notification system features the following:

- **Customizable Notifications with Parameters** &mdash; Full flexibility to customize the [notification message](#creating-a-notification-string) with parameters, for example "Your gold goose egg has hatched!" or "You're 2 quests away from reaching Level&nbsp;6!"
- **Launch Data** &mdash; Include optional [launch data](#including-launch-and-analytics-data) that can be read through `Class.Player:GetJoinData()` when the notification recipient joins. This could involve routing a user to a coordinate location or personalizing their joining experience.
- **Analytics Support** &mdash; Track your reachable audience and the performance of your notifications in the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
