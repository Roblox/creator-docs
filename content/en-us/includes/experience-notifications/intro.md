The Experience Notification system features the following:

- **Customizable Notifications with Parameters** &mdash; Full flexibility to customize the [notification message](#creating-a-notification-string) with parameters, for example:

	<p><Chip label="Your gold goose egg has hatched!" size="large" color="primary" variant="outlined" /></p>
	<p><Chip label="Allie @LaterSk8er1 just beat your record on the Tokyo Tour track!" size="large" color="primary" variant="outlined" /></p>

- **Launch Data** &mdash; Include optional [launch data](#including-launch-and-analytics-data) that can be read through `Class.Player:GetJoinData()` when the notification recipient joins. This could involve routing a user to a coordinate location or personalizing their joining experience.

- **Analytics Support** &mdash; Track your reachable audience and the performance of your notifications in the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
