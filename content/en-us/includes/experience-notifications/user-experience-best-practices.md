Notifications should be **personalized** to the receiver and should be based on inâ€‘experience activity that's specifically relevant to the user. Inversely, notifications should not be of a generic, advertising nature.

<Alert severity="success">
<Typography variant="subtitle2">You're 2 races away from completing the weekly challenge!</Typography>
</Alert>

<Alert severity="error">
<Typography variant="subtitle2">A new line of race cars just dropped in Race Car Craze. Check them out!</Typography>
</Alert>

Ideally, notifications should also alert users of something they can take **immediate action** on. Avoid purely informational notifications that do not prompt a direct response or action.

<Alert severity="success">
<Typography variant="subtitle2">Allie @LaterSk8er1 just beat your record on the Tokyo Tour track! Time for revenge?</Typography>
</Alert>

<Alert severity="error">
<Typography variant="subtitle2">It's been a few days since you participated in a race with Allie @LaterSk8er1.</Typography>
</Alert>

Please also ensure that you are following the [guidelines](#guidelines) before using Experience Notifications.
