The **Avatar Inspect Menu** allows users to view another user's Roblox avatar character, try on items, and even make purchases within an experience. Roblox enables this menu by default and users in your experience can access this menu in three ways:

- Opening the experience's main menu and clicking the **View** button next to a user in the **Players** tab.
- Clicking on a user's name in the player list (upper-right section of the game view).
- Selecting the Inspect option in the [Avatar Context Menu](../players/avatar-context-menu.md), an opt-in feature which provides additional user-to-user social interaction.

You can customize a user's **Avatar Inspect Menu** in the following ways:

- Change the inspect target from the user's Roblox avatar to their [current in-experience appearance](#inspecting-currently-equipped-items).
- Change the inspect target to a [specific User ID](#inspecting-specific-users), even if they are not in the experience.

For more specific catalog access, you can also use the [Avatar Editor Service](../players/avatar-editor.md) to access and make changes to a user's platform-wide avatar within an experience.

## Inspecting Currently Equipped Items

By default, the Inspect Menu shows the same information as the user's Roblox Avatar profile page. The avatar outfit may not match the user's current appearance, since you may have opted to equip different accessories or avatar items at that specific moment.

In the cases where the default Inspect Menu may not be accurate to the current character's outfit, you can inspect a character's current outfit with the following steps:

1. Disable the default profile-based Inspect Menu by setting `Class.GuiService:SetInspectMenuEnabled()` with a value of **false**.
2. Get a current `Class.HumanoidDescription` from the target player character.
3. Call `Class.GuiService:InspectPlayerFromHumanoidDescription()` to load the Inspect menu based off of the `Class.HumanoidDescription`.

Use the following code sample to inspect the currently equipped items of a specific player:

```lua
local GuiService = game:GetService("GuiService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local player = Players.LocalPlayer

-- Make profile-based Inspect Menu inaccessible
GuiService:SetInspectMenuEnabled(false)

local humanoid = player.Character and player.Character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
if humanoid then
  -- Get current HumanoidDescription from a player character
  local humanoidDescription = humanoid:GetAppliedDescription()

  -- Load the inspect menu from a humanoid description
  GuiService:InspectPlayerFromHumanoidDescription(humanoidDescription, player.Name)
end
```

## Inspecting Specific Users

The Avatar Inspect Menu can inspect players who aren't in the current experience. You can use `Class.GuiService:InspectPlayerFromUserId()` to inspect a player from any `Class.Player.UserId`.

Use the following code sample to open the Avatar Inspect Menu based on a `Class.Player.UserId|UserId`:

```lua

local GuiService = game:GetService("GuiService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- Get user ID by player name
local success, userId = pcall(function()
  return Players:GetUserIdFromNameAsync("IgnisRBX")
end)

if success then
  GuiService:InspectPlayerFromUserId(userId)
end
```
