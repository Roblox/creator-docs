title: Animation Capture
description: Animation Capture in the Animation Editor allows you to generate high-quality, realistic animations for faces and bodies.
---

You can record or upload video content to the [Animation Editor](../animation/editor.md) to quickly capture movement and expressions as animation keyframes. These tools can create unique and realistic animations within minutes while providing access to the animation keyframes for additional adjustments.

The Animation Capture tools allow you to:

- [Record your face](#face) with a webcam to puppeteer characters with [animation compatible heads](../art/characters/facial-animation/index.md).
- [Upload full-body video content](#body) to generate high quality realistic animations for an entire character.

## Face

**Animation Capture - Face** allows you to use your camera to puppeteer rigs with [animation compatible heads](../art/characters/facial-animation/index.md) and generate corresponding keyframes to your movement.

With the ability to record up to 60-second animations, you can quickly provide both your playable and nonplayable characters the means to realistically grin, raise their eyebrows, drop their jaw, or any other expression necessary for your experience.

### Enabling the Face Capture Beta

To ensure that you are able to utilize your camera to record and create facial animations, you must first enable the **Face Capture** beta feature. If you do not enable the beta feature, the [Animation Editor](../animation/editor.md) only displays its default UI options without face recording functionality.

To enable the Animation Capture - Face beta feature:

1. In the menu bar, click **File**. A contextual menu displays.
2. Select **Beta Features**. The **Beta Features** window displays.
3. In the beta features list, enable **Face Capture**.

4. Click the **Save** button.
5. Restart Studio.

### Recording Face Animations

Before you begin to record your face, ensure that you're in a well lit room close enough to your camera so that your face is in the center of your camera's recording frame. This increases your camera's ability to distinguish you from your surroundings so that you can accurately puppeteer your avatar and create high-quality animations.

To record your face and create an animation:

1. Open the **Animation Editor**.

   1. In the menu bar, navigate to the **Avatar** tab.
   1. In the **Animations** section, click on the **Animation Editor**. The **Animation Editor** window displays.

2. In the **Explorer** window, select the rig you want your video to animate. A dialog displays.

   width="380" />

3. In the **Animation Name** field, enter a new animation name, then click the **Create** button. The Animation Editor window displays the media and playback controls, timeline, and track list.

4. Navigate to the **track list** and click the **Face Capture** button. A pop-up displays asking you to acknowledge that you consent to the collection of your facial movements to enable the feature and camera access.

7. When you finish your recording, click either the red square or countdown timer. Keyframes that correspond to your facial movement display within the timeline.

8. (Optional) If you'd like to delete that recording and try again, click the Re-Record button.

After you finish your recording, you can [fine-tune](../animation/editor.md#keyframes) the keyframes, [save](../animation/editor.md#saving-an-animation) your animation, then [export](../animation/editor.md#exporting-an-animation) it to use across all of your experiences.

## Body

The **Animation Capture - Body** allows you to quickly generate high-quality, realistic full-body animations for your R15 rigs by uploading videos to use to track the body's movement and generate corresponding keyframes. This significantly speeds up the manual process of creating animations, and allows you to personalize your avatars and NPCs with life-like mannerisms in a few minutes.

### Enabling the Body Capture Beta

To ensure that the UI options display that you need in order to import a video for animation creation, you must first enable the **Live Animation Creator** beta feature. If you do not enable the beta feature, the [Animation Editor](../animation/editor.md) only displays its default UI options without live animation creation functionality.

2. Select **Beta Features**. The **Beta Features** window displays.
