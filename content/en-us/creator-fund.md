The **Creator Fund** program is for creators and developers who want to build the next generation of experiences on Roblox. Our goal is to work closely with you to provide funding, support, and insights for the development of your content. Funding for approved participants starts at a minimum of $500,000 per project.

With the launch of the Creator Fund, we want new and existing developers to have the resources necessary to build something special and bring people together through play. This program is designed to support developers who are eager to push the boundaries of what Roblox experiences can deliver.

## Eligible projects

We are looking for ambitious, innovative projects that enable creative ideas that are unlike anything else on the platform.

We prioritize projects that encompass:

- Multiplayer-focused.
- Cross-platform, with mobile optimization in mind.
- Social mechanics as key to the experience.
- Strong retention, monetization, and live operations plans.
- In-experience avatars that reflect elements of the user's platform avatar identity. Ability to leverage items that you can equip on platform avatars, like the ones you buy in the [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog).

If you are accepted into the program, we partner with you to define key deliverables for your project and provide funding based off of your progress towards these milestones.
