title: Text Filtering
description: Text filtering prevents users from seeing inappropriate language and blocks personally identifiable information.
---

Applied to various sources and inputs, **text filtering** prevents users from seeing inappropriate language and personally identifiable information such as phone numbers. Roblox automatically filters common text outputs such as messages that have passed through [in-experience text chat](../chat/in-experience-text-chat.md), but **you are responsible for filtering any displayed text that you don't have explicit control over**.

<Alert severity="error">
Because filtering is crucial for a safe environment, Roblox actively moderates the content of experiences to make sure they meet [community standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards). If Roblox receives reports or automatically detects that your experience doesn't apply text filtering, then the system removes the experience until you add filtering.
</Alert>

## Filter Scenarios

Text can be gathered and/or displayed to users in a variety of scenarios, including:

- An experience that gathers users' [text input](../ui/text-input.md) through `Class.TextBox` entries, a custom GUI with buttons such as a keyboard/keypad interface, or an interactive keyboard model in the 3D space.

- An experience that generates words from random characters and displays them to users, as there's a chance it will create inappropriate words.

- An experience that connects to an external web server to fetch content that is displayed in-experience. Often you will not have control over the content of the external site and a third party can edit the information.

- An experience that stores text such as users' pet names using [data stores](../cloud-services/data-stores), where the stored text might include inappropriate words that should be filtered when retrieving them.

## Filtering Process

`Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()` filters in-experience text by taking a string of text and the `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` of the user who created the text as input. It returns a `Class.TextFilterResult` object which has two additional methods that you can call in different scenarios:

- `Class.TextFilterResult:GetNonChatStringForBroadcastAsync()` for filtering text visible to all users in an experience, such as for a dialog that lets a user write a message on a sign that's visible to all users on the server.
- `Class.TextFilterResult:GetNonChatStringForUserAsync()` to display filtered text for one specific user, based on age and other details.

In the context of `Class.TextBox` input, the following example gathers input on the `Class.TextBox.FocusLost|FocusLost` event and sends it to the server through a `Class.RemoteEvent`. On the server, it is filtered first through `Class.TextService:FilterStringAsync()|FilterStringAsync()` and then `Class.TextFilterResult:GetNonChatStringForBroadcastAsync()|GetNonChatStringForBroadcastAsync()` with the intention that the text will be displayed to all users on a serverâ€‘side object such as a `Class.SurfaceGui` in the 3D world.

<Alert severity="warning">
Do not filter text in real-time "per character entered" into a `Class.TextBox`, as doing so yields for text that's only visible to the user typing it. Instead, filter the entered text **after** the user submits it.
