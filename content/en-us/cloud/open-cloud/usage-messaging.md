title: Usage Guide for Messaging
description: Explains how to use Open Cloud Messaging Service API to support cross-server messaging.
---

[Messaging Service API](../../reference/cloud/messaging-service/v1.json) is the Open Cloud equivalent to Lua `Class.MessagingService`, which enables you to communicate across servers or client instances of your experience. As the Lua API only allows you to write and update a script manually in Studio for publishing messages, you can use the Open Cloud API to send messages to live servers from external tools to automate and improve your experience operation workflows.

## Usage

There are several helpful tools that you can build by supporting cross-server communication with Messaging Service API, including:

- **Announcement Portals**: A web portal can be helpful to support sending announcements to all users across servers in your experience, such as announcing an upcoming event, an update, and the winner for a competition. On the portal, you can edit a message and click a button that calls the API to send the message out for all users or selected users.

- **Moderation System**: A moderation system can help keep your experience safe and secure. When detecting a user with inappropriate behavior, you can publish a message to trigger the experience server to warn or ban the specific user. You can also support [data stores](../../reference/cloud/datastores-api/v1.json) in the moderation system to add user accounts to a blocklist that prevents them from rejoining.

- **LiveOps Dashboard**: LiveOps Dashboard is a useful tool for managing live events, such as a Halloween party. On the LiveOps dashboard, you can pre-code an event, update event messages, trigger the event when it's ready, and reward selected users with special items like a virtual crown without updating any of the experience's code.

Currently, the API can only target live experience servers through HTTP.

## Setting up a Topic for Messaging

Before you can publish a message to all of your experience's live servers, you need to set up a **topic**, which is a customized message channel that is accessible from multiple servers. After defining a **topic**, you need to subscribe users to the **topic** for receiving your incoming messages.

Currently, you can only define a topic in Studio and use Lua `Class.MessagingService:SubscribeAsync()` to subscribe users to it. The following code sample subscribes any user to a topic when they join the experience:

```lua title= 'Set up and Subscribe Users to a Topic'
local MessagingService = game:GetService("MessagingService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	-- Define and subscribe to the topic
	local topic = "YourTopic"
	local connection = MessagingService:SubscribeAsync(topic, function(message)
		print(message.Data)
	end)

	player.AncestryChanged:Connect(function()
		-- Unsubscribe from the topic upon player ancestry change
		connection:Disconnect()
	end)
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

## Publishing Messages to Live Servers

After [setting up](#setting-up-a-topic-for-messaging) a **topic**, you can publish a message to all of your experience's live servers with the following steps:

1. [Create an API key](./api-keys.md#creating-an-API-key) on [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/credentials). Make sure you perform the following settings:

   1. Add **Messaging Service API** to **Access Permissions**.
   2. Add **Publish** operation to your selected experience.

2. Get the **Universe ID**, the identifier of the experience in which you want to send your messages to.

   1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
   1. Find the experience that you want to publish your messages to.
   1. Click the **&ctdot;** button on the target experience's thumbnail to display a list of options, then select **Copy&nbsp;Universe&nbsp;ID**.

      <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Menu-Copy-Universe-ID.png" width="420" />

3. Add the API Key in the `x-api-key` header of a `POST` request to the API like the following example:

   ```bash title='Example Request for Publishing a Message'
   curl \
   --location \
   --request POST \
   'https://apis.roblox.com/messaging-service/v1/universes/{universeId}/topics/{topic}' \
   -H 'x-api-key: abc...' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '{"message":"message to publish"}'
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   If your request succeeds, it returns an empty response body.
   </Alert>

4. Call the API to send the message out.

## Adding Messaging Service API to OAuth 2.0 Apps

You can create [OAuth 2.0 applications](../../cloud/open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md) supporting Messaging Service API to allow your users to publish messages to live servers through your OAuth 2.0 application.

<Alert severity="warning">
Third-Party app support through OAuth 2.0 is a Beta feature that might be subject to changes for future releases.
</Alert>

To use Messaging Service API for your application and request permissions from your users, perform the following settings:

1. When [registering your application](./oauth2-registration.md#registering-an-app), under **Permissions**, select the **universe-messaging-service:publish** scope.
2. When [implementing the authorization flow](../../cloud/open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md#implementing-authorization-flows), include `universe-messaging-service:publish` in the `scope` parameter of the authorization URL that redirects users back to your application, like the following example:

   ```plain
   https://www.authorize.roblox.com?client_id=816547628409595165403873012&redirect_uri=https://my-app.com/redirect&scope=openid+universe-messaging-service:publish&response_type=Code&prompts=login+consent&nonce=12345&state=6789
   ```

3. Request access to the `universeId` of the experience that the user wants to publish their messages to. Your application can send a `POST` request to the [token resources endpoint](../../reference/cloud/oauth2/tokens.md#post-v1tokenresources) with the access token, client ID and secret or the `code challenge` , depending on your [implementation of your authorization flow](../../cloud/open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md#implementing-authorization-flows), as request parameters to get a list of `universeIds` of experiences that the user granted permission to:

   ```bash title="Example Request"
   curl --location --request POST 'https://apis.roblox.com/oauth/v1/token/resources' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   --data-urlencode 'token=<access_token>' \
   --data-urlencode 'client_id=<client_id>' \
   --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<client_secret>'
   ```

   This endpoint returns a list of `universeIds` like the following example response:

   ```json title="Example Response"
   {
     "resource_infos": [
       {
         "owner": {
           "id": "1516563360",
           "type": "User"
         },
         "resources": {
           "universe": {
             "ids": ["3828411582"]
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Your application can now send messages to any experience that a user has granted permission. When sending the request, include the access token in the authorization header and the `universeId` and topic in the request URI in the following format:

   ```bash title="Example Request"
   curl --location --request POST 'https://apis.roblox.com/messaging-service/v1/universes/{universeId}/topics/{topic}' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '{"message":"message to publish"}'
   ```
