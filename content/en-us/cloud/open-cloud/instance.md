title: Engine Instance
description: Explains how to use Open Cloud Web APIs to access the Roblox Engine Instances.
---

The Engine Open Cloud APIs let you manage `Class.Instance` objects in your
Roblox experiences from the web.

## Beta Restrictions

These APIs are currently in beta and have the following restrictions:

- You can only read and update `Class.Script`, `Class.LocalScript`, and
  `Class.ModuleScript` objects.

- You can't update scripts that are currently open in Roblox Studio.

- You can't update scripts that are part of a [package](../../projects/assets/packages.md).

- You can only use API key authentication. Create an
  [API key](../open-cloud/api-keys.md) with **Engine (Beta)** added as an API
  system.

  You must specify the experiences you want the key to have access to as
  well as the desired read and write permission scopes.

  ![The Creator Hub API key screen](../../assets/open-cloud/instance-api-beta.png)

- You must have a [collaborative](../../projects/collaboration.md) session enabled for the experience that you want to access.

## Listing Children

List all children of a specific instance by specifying an instance ID and
calling the [List Instance Children](../../cloud/reference/Instance#List-Instance-Children)
method.

<Alert severity="info">
The first time you use these methods, specify `root` for the instance ID. After
you receive the list of top-level children and their IDs, you can make
additional calls to find instances deeper within your place's instance
hierarchy.

  return results

response = ListChildren()
print("Operation Results:", response.status_code, response.text)

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Rather than just listing the children, the response includes an `Operation`
object with a different endpoint. [Poll this endpoint](#polling-for-results) to
asynchronously retrieve the actual list of children. A more complete code sample
looks like this:

```python
import requests
import time

apiKey = "<API_KEY>"
universeId = "<UNIVERSE_ID>"
placeId = "<PLACE_ID>"
instanceId = "root"

apiKeyHeaderKey = "x-api-key"

listChildrenUrl = "https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/universes/%s/places/%s/instances/%s:listChildren"
getOperationUrl = "https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/%s"

numberOfRetries = 10
retryPollingCadence = 5

doneJSONKey = "done"

def ListChildren():
  url = listChildrenUrl % (universeId, placeId, instanceId)
  headerData = {apiKeyHeaderKey: apiKey}
  results = requests.get(url, headers = headerData)
  return results

def GetOperation(operationPath):
  url = getOperationUrl % (operationPath)
  headerData = {apiKeyHeaderKey: apiKey}
  results = requests.get(url, headers = headerData)
  return results

def PollForResults(operationPath):
  currentRetries = 0
  while (currentRetries < numberOfRetries):
    time.sleep(retryPollingCadence)
    results = GetOperation(operationPath)
    currentRetries += 1

    if (results.status_code != 200 or results.json()[doneJSONKey]):
      return results

response = ListChildren()
print("Operation Results:", response.status_code, response.text)
# Parse the Operation object's path to use in polling for the instance resource.
operationPath = response.json()['path']
response = PollForResults(operationPath)
print("Response:", response.status_code, response.text)
```

The final response might look something like this:

```json
{
  "path": "universes/1234567890/places/98765432109/instances/root/operations/a1a2a3a4-a1a2-a1a2-a1a2-a1a2a3a4a5a6",
  "done": true,
  "response": {
    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/roblox.open_cloud.cloud.v2.ListInstanceChildrenResponse",
    "instances": [
      {
        "path": "universes/1234567890/places/98765432109/instances/b1b2b3b4-b1b2-b1b2-b1b2-b1b2b3b4b5b6",
        "hasChildren": true,
        "engineInstance": {
          "Id": "b1b2b3b4-b1b2-b1b2-b1b2-b1b2b3b4b5b6",
          "Parent": "a1a2a3a4-a1a2-a1a2-a1a2-a1a2a3a4a5a6",
          "Name": "Workspace",
          "Details": {}
        }
      },

      ...

    ]
  }
}
```

You can then iterate over the JSON to find a particular instance ID:

```python
instances = response.json()['response']['instances']
replicatedStorageId = ""
for i in instances:
  if i['engineInstance']['Name'] == "ReplicatedStorage":
    replicatedStorageId = i['engineInstance']['Id']

if replicatedStorageId:
  # You now have an instance ID and can get or update it.
else:
  # The name wasn't found.
```

Scripts contain some additional information in the `Details` object, such as the script type, source, and whether they're enabled.

## Getting an Instance

This method returns a single [Instance](../../cloud/reference/Instance).

  <TabItem key = "1" label="Python">

```python
import requests

# Generate at https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials
apiKey = "<API_KEY>"
# Find at https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations in the overflow menu of an experience tile
universeId = "<UNIVERSE_ID>"
# Find Start Place ID at https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations in the overflow menu of an experience tile
placeId = "<PLACE_ID>"
# The default ID for the root of any place's data model
instanceId = "<INSTANCE_ID>"

# Request header
apiKeyHeaderKey = "x-api-key"
# Endpoint URL for Get Instance method
getInstanceUrl = "https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/universes/%s/places/%s/instances/%s"

def GetInstance():
  url = getInstanceUrl % (universeId, placeId, instanceId)
  headerData = {apiKeyHeaderKey: apiKey}
  return requests.get(url, headers = headerData)

response = GetInstance()
print("Response:", response.status_code, response.text)

# Parse the Operation object's path from response. See the Polling for Results section for more information.
operationPath = response.json()['path']
```

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Just like the List Instance Children method, the response includes an
`Operation` object that you poll to retrieve the actual instance. See
[Polling for Results](#polling-for-results) for more information.

## Updating Instances

After you obtain the appropriate instance ID, you can update it.
[Poll for results](#polling-for-results) after making the initial update
request.

```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Alert severity="info">
If you receive a `TypeError` when attempting to update a script, verify that the script isn't open in Roblox Studio. If it is, close its Script Editor tab. You can also check the Studio output for additional errors, such as `Engine_OC_API: Processing Error - Live scripting session is active`.
</Alert>

## Polling for Results

All current [Instance](../../cloud/reference/Instance) methods return an
`Operation` object instead of the resource you requested. This object lets you
asynchronously perform the original operation. Use the `Operation` object's
path (included in the initial response) to poll for when the resource is ready.

You can use a variety of polling strategies, such as using exponential backoff
or a fixed delay in between requests. The following example polls every five
seconds, up to 10 times.

  <TabItem key = "1" label="Python">

```python
import requests
import time

# Generate at https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials
apiKey = "<API_KEY>"
# Use the Operation path from your initial request
# Takes the form of "universes/<UNIVERSE_ID>/places/<PLACE_ID>/instances/<INSTANCE_ID>/operations/<OPERATION_ID>"
operationPath = "<OPERATION_PATH>"

# Polling constants
numberOfRetries = 10
retryPollingCadence = 5

def PollForResults(operationPath):
  currentRetries = 0
  while (currentRetries < numberOfRetries):
    time.sleep(retryPollingCadence)
    results = GetOperation(operationPath)
    currentRetries += 1

    if (results.status_code != 200 or results.json()[doneJSONKey]):
      return results

response = PollForResults(operationPath)
print("Response:", response.status_code, response.text)

## Potion Shop Demo

The Potion Shop Google Sheets demo shows you to update an experience's script
from the web. The demo consists of the following:

- An uncopylocked place with a mock UI that displays various potions and their
  prices.
- A `.ods` file that you import into Google Sheets. This spreadsheet lets you
  specify and update values for properties within the experience.
- Code for a Google Apps Script that reads data from the Google Sheet and
  updates the **ReplicatedStorage > ItemList** script in the Potion Shop
  experience.

### Setting up the Demo
