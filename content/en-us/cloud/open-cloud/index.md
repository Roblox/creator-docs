**Manage Roblox resources from the web.**

With Open Cloud, you can build tools and apps to access Roblox resources through
standard web APIs. These APIs allow you to automate internal workflows, improve
efficiency with content creation and management, and support experience
operations from the web. Open Cloud is RESTful and supports HTTPS requests.

To begin using the Open Cloud APIs:

1. See the authentication documentation on
   how to use [OAuth 2.0](oauth2-overview.md) or
   [API Keys](api-keys.md) to authenticate calls to
   resource methods.
2. See the Open Cloud [reference documentation](../reference/index.md) to learn
   how to use the APIs.
