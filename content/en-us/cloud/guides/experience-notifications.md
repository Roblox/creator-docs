After they receive a notification, users can join the experience directly via the **Join** button and spawn according to your [launch data](#include-launch-and-analytics-data).

For more information on features, eligibility requirements, usage guidelines, and the corresponding Engine API, see the [Experiences guide](../../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md).

## Implementation

The [UserNotification](/cloud/reference/UserNotification) resource lets you send experience notifications to users. Before using it, you must [generate an API key](../../cloud/auth/api-keys.md) or [configure OAuth 2.0](../../cloud/auth/oauth2-overview.md) for your app. The examples on this page use API keys.

To send an experience notification to a user:

1. [Create a notification string](../../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md#create-a-notification-string) in the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations). This step must be done in the Creator Dashboard; there's no Open Cloud API for it.
1. Form the request:
   1. Copy the API key to the `x-api-key` request header.
   1. Copy the notification string asset ID as the value of the `payload.message_id` property.
   1. Set `payload.type` to `"MOMENT"`.
   1. Set `source.universe` to be the universe resource URL `"universes/${UniverseID}"`.

```bash title="Send an experience notification"
curl --location 'https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/users/${UserId}/notifications' \
--header 'x-api-key: ${ApiKey}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
	"source": {
		"universe": "universes/${UniverseID}"
	},
	"payload": {
		"message_id": "${AssetID}",
		"type": "MOMENT"
	}
}'
```

Example response which returns the notification ID in the `id` field:

```json
{
  "path": "users/505306092/notifications/6ca4d981-36fa-4255-82a1-14d95c116889",
  "id": "6ca4d981-36fa-4255-82a1-14d95c116889"
}
```

### Customize notifications using parameters

To customize the notification for each recipient, include **parameters** in the [notification string](#implementation). Then customize the parameters when calling the API. For example, you can define the notification string as:

<p><Chip label="{userId-friend} beat your high score by {points} points! Time to level up?" size="large" color="primary" variant="outlined" /></p>

Add the `userId-friend` and `points` parameters in the script:

```bash title="Customize Notification Using Parameters"
curl --location 'https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/users/${UserId}/notifications' \
--header 'x-api-key: ${ApiKey}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
	"source": {
		"universe": "universes/${UniverseID}"
	},
	"payload": {
		"message_id": "${AssetID}",
		"type": "MOMENT",
		"parameters": {
			"userId-friend": {"int64_value": 3702832553},
			"points": {"string_value": "5"}
		}
	}
}'
```

### Include launch and analytics data

To further improve user experience, you can include **launch data** in the notification, useful for scenarios such as routing users to a coordinate location or personalizing the joining experience. Additionally, you can include [analytics](../../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md#analytics) data to segment the performance of different categories of notifications.

```bash title="Include Launch Data and Analytics Data"
curl --location 'https://apis.roblox.com/cloud/v2/users/${UserId}/notifications' \
--header 'x-api-key: ${ApiKey}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
	"source": {
		"universe": "universes/${UniverseID}"
	},
	"payload": {
		"message_id": "${AssetID}",
		"type": "MOMENT"
	},
	"join_experience": {
		"launch_data": "Test_Launch_Data"
	},
	"analytics_data": {
		"category": "Test_Analytics_Category"
	}
}'
```

## Rate limits and delivery

Each user can receive **one** notification per day from a given experience, and you receive transparent feedback when a user's throttle limit is reached.

There are many other reasons that a notification might not be delivered. For more information, see [Delivery system](../../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md#delivery-system) in the Engine guide.
