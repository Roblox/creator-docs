title: Open Cloud guides
description: In addition to using Engine and Studio tools to create experiences on Roblox, you can automate your internal workflows, improve your efficiency creating content, and support your experience operation needs from the web.

The Open Cloud guides provide detailed walkthroughs for popular Open Cloud use cases, such as [retrieving user inventories](inventory.md), [sending announcements](usage-messaging.md), or [using webhooks](../webhooks/webhook-notifications.md) to notify your apps of certain events.

Guides often include sample code in Python or Node.js and are a great way to get started, understand a resource, and spark ideas for your own usage.

For a comprehensive summary of available resources, see the Open Cloud API reference.
