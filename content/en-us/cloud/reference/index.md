Open Cloud APIs are a set of resources and methods that let you build tools and
apps to access Roblox resources with standard web APIs. Open Cloud APIs are
RESTful, support HTTPS requests, and support [API
Key](../open-cloud/api-keys.md) and
[OAuth 2.0](../open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md) authentication.

The **Common Components** section of the reference documentation describe
concepts and APIs that apply to all of Open Cloud. This includes the following
documents:

- [OAuth 2.0](../../cloud/reference/oauth2.md) - Describes the endpoints needed to
  implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. For complete implementation
  documentation, see the [OAuth 2.0 guides](../open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md).
- [Patterns](../../cloud/reference/patterns.md) - Describes special considerations and
  patterns when making requests and handling responses.
- [Types](../../cloud/reference/types.md) - Describes common types used by Open Cloud in
  requests and responses.
- [Errors](../../cloud/reference/errors.md) - Describes the Open Cloud error model and
  how to handle errors when working with resources.

The **Resources** sections describe all the resources available in Open Cloud.
Each page represents a resource and contains all the methods that can act on the
corresponding resource.
