description: Get comprehensive API reference documentation for the entire Open Cloud platform.

The Open Cloud APIs let you build tools and apps to access Roblox resources with standard web APIs. Open Cloud APIs are RESTful, support HTTPS, and use [API keys](../open-cloud/api-keys.md) or [OAuth 2.0](../open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md) for authentication.

The **Common Components** section of the reference documentation includes concepts and other information that applies to all of Open Cloud:

- [OAuth 2.0](../../cloud/reference/oauth2.md) - Endpoints needed to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. For complete implementation documentation, see the [OAuth 2.0 guides](../open-cloud/oauth2-overview.md).
- [Patterns](../../cloud/reference/patterns.md) - Special considerations and patterns for making requests and handling responses.
- [Types](../../cloud/reference/types.md) - How to handle common types used by Open Cloud in requests and responses.
- [Errors](../../cloud/reference/errors.md) - Handling errors when working with resources.

Each page in the **Resources** section represents a resource and includes all available operations for that resource.
