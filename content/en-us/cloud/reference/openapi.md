title: OpenAPI Descriptions
description: Provides links to the Open Cloud JSON files that are compliant to the OpenAPI Specification, explains their use cases, and outlines additional information.
---

The reference pages in the **Resources** section are rendered from JSON files that are [OpenAPI descriptions](https://learn.openapis.org/glossary.html). These files use [version 3.0.4](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4) of the OpenAPI specification.

These files are open source and can be used with tools like the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test API calls and help streamline development.

These OpenAPI descriptions are still under active development and may contain issues. The pages under the **Resources** section are the official reference.

## OpenAPI Description Files

OpenAPI description files are available at the following locations within the [creator-docs](https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs/tree/main/content/en-us/reference/cloud) repository:

### Vendor Extensions

Roblox uses [specification extensions](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4#specification-extensions) to extend the OpenAPI specification. These extensions represent information that the specification doesn't capture by default. Extensions may appear throughout the file where allowed by the OpenAPI specification.

The majority of these specification extensions are experimental. The extensions used are subject to change without notice in favor of fields found within the official OpenAPI specification.

<Alert severity="info">
The OpenAPI descriptions for V1 and V2 resources utilitize distinct specification extensions due to underlying implementation differences.
