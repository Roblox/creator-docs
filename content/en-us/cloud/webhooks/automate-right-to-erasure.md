title: Automating Right to Erasure Requests
description: Explains how to automate Right to Erasure requests with webhooks and Open Cloud APIs for data stores.
---

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is a European regulation on data protection and privacy. It grants individuals the right to request the deletion of their personal data, known as the [right to erasure](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/). If you store any **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** of your users, such as their User IDs, you must comply with GDPR requirements by deleting this information upon receiving a user's request.

Instead of handling requests manually, you can [set up a webhook](../../cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.md) and use a bot within a third-party messaging application to automate the process. As [data stores](../../cloud-services/datastores.md) being the most common way for storing PII data, this tutorial provides an example on how to create a bot within Guilded or Discord that uses the [Open Cloud API for data stores](../../cloud/open-cloud/usage-data-stores.md) to delete PII data as an automation solution.

## Workflow

Upon completing this tutorial, you should be able to create a locally-running custom program that automates the handling of right to erasure requests from users. The workflow for this process is as follows:

1. Roblox Support receives a right to erasure request from a user.
1. Roblox webhook is triggered, containing the User ID and a list of Start Place IDs for the experiences they have joined in the payload.
1. Your bot listens for these webhook notifications, verifies their authenticity, and utilizes the [Open Cloud API for data stores](../../cloud/open-cloud/usage-data-stores.md) to delete the PII data stored in data stores.
   <Alert severity="warning">
   To use this solution, make sure your data store keys are identifiable by User IDs, such as containing User IDs as substrings, or you need to modify the scripts to match your own data schema.
   </Alert>
1. The bot responds to the webhook message in Discord or Guilded with the deletion status.

## Configuring a Webhook with Third-Party Integration

Before creating a bot, set up a server with webhook integration on the third-party messaging application. Then use the server to configure a webhook on Creator Dashboard.

### Setting Up a Server

The following steps show how to set up the server using Guilded or Discord.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Guilded">
1. Create a new Guilded server. If you are unfamiliar with the process, see [Guilded Support](https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/1500002751582-Create-a-Server).
1. Under the **Privacy** settings, set the server to private. The server automatically creates a private **#general** channel as your default channel.
1. Create a webhook integration with the new server and give it a name that you can easily understand, such as `GDPR Hook`. If you are unfamiliar with the process, see [Guilded Support](https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360038927934-Incoming-Webhooks).
1. Copy the webhook URL and store it in a secure place. Only allow trusted team members to access it, as leaking the URL can enable bad actors to send fake messages and potentially delete your user data.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Discord">
1. Create a new Discord server. If you are unfamiliar with the process, see [Discord Support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-).
    <Alert severity="info">
    It's recommended to set your server as a private server to protect user security. See [Discord Support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206143407-How-do-I-set-up-a-private-server-) if you are unfamiliar with the process.
    </Alert>

1. The server automatically creates a **#general** channel as your default channel. Click the **Edit Channel** icon of the **#general** channel.
1. Under **Permissions**, set the channel to private.
1. Create a webhook integration with the new server, name it to `GDPR Hook`. If you are unfamiliar with the process, see [Discord Support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
1. Copy the webhook URL and store it in a secure place. Only allow trusted team members to access it, as leaking the URL can enable bad actors to send fake messages and potentially delete your user data.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuring a Webhook on Roblox

After obtaining the third-party server URL, use it to [configure a webhook](../../cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.md#configuring-webhooks-on-creator-dashboard) on Creator Dashboard. make sure you perform the following settings:

<Alert severity="info">
Currently, only group owners can receive Right to Erasure requests for group-owned experiences. To implement the automation solution for a group-owned experience, make sure that the group owner configures the webhook.
</Alert>

- Add the Guilded or Discord server URL as the **Webhook URL**.
- Include a custom **Secret**. Though a secret is optional for completing the configuration, you should include one to prevent bad actors from impersonating Roblox and deleting your data. For more information on the usage of a secret, see [Verifying Webhook Security](../../cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.md#verifying-webhook-security).
- Select **Right to Erasure Request** under **Triggers**.

You can test the webhook using the **Test Response** button to see if you receive a notification in your server's **#general** channel from Roblox. If you don't receive the notification, try again or check your server settings to troubleshoot the error.

## Configuring a Bot

After you add the webhook, use it to configure the bot with the following steps:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Guilded">

1. Open the **All servers** list by clicking its icon or use the shortcut:

   - <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> on Windows.
   - <kbd>Command âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> on Mac.

1. Select your server for receiving right to erasure notifications.
1. Expand the list under **Server home** and select **Manage Bots**.
1. The server automatically creates a private **#general** channel as your default channel.
1. Click the **Create a bot** button and add a bot name. Guilded redirects you to the bot configuration page.
1. Select the **API** section on the bot configuration page.
1. Under the **Tokens** section, click the **Generate Token** button.
1. Save and store the generated token in a safe place.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Discord">
1. Navigate to the [Applications page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
1. Create a new application and name it to `GDPR Bot`.
1. The system redirects you to the **General Information** settings of the bot. Copy and save its application ID in a secure place.
1. Under the settings menu, select **OAuth2**.
1. Under the **Default Authorization Link** section, expand the **Authorization Method** dropdown and select **In-app Authorization**.
1. Add the **bot** scope and the **Administrator** permission. Save your changes.
1. Under the **OAuth2** settings, select the **URL Generator** subcategory.
1. Select the **bot** scope and the **Administrator** permission.
1. Copy the generated URL. Leave the application settings page unclosed.
1. Navigate to the generated URL. Select the target server. Click the **Continue** button and then the **Authorize** button.
1. Navigate back to application settings page of your bot. Under the settings menu, select **bot**.
1. Under the **Privileged Gateway Intents** section, enable **Message Content Intent**.
1. Under the **Build-A-Bot** section, save the bot token in a secure place for later steps. If you don't see the token, click the **Reset Token** button to generate a new one.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Creating an Open Cloud API Key

To allow your third-party bot to access your data stores for storing PII data of users, [create an Open Cloud API key](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/cloud/managing-api-keys) that can access your experiences and add the **Delete Entry** permission of data stores for data deletion. If you use ordered data stores for storing PII, you also need to add the **Write** permission of ordered data stores. After completion, copy and save the API key in a secure location to use it in later steps.

## Obtaining Identifiers of Experiences and Places

For the bot to locate the PII data requested by users for deletion, obtain the following identifiers of all experiences that you intend to use the bot for:

- The **Universe ID**, the unique identifier of your experience.
- The **Start Place ID**, the unique identifier of the start place of an experience.

To obtain these identifiers, open the [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations?activeTab=Place) page on **Creator Dashboard**. Then select an experience and copy the **Universe ID** and **Start Place ID**.

<img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Context-Menu-Copy-Universe-ID-Start-Place-ID.png" width="420" alt="Copy Universe ID and Copy Start Place ID options from Creator Dashboard" />

## Adding Scripts

After you finish setting up the webhook, bot, and API key for data stores, add them to the scripts that implement the bot's automation logic. The following example uses Python 3:

1.  Install Python libraries using the following commands:

    ```bash title="Install Libraries"
    pip3 install discord
    pip3 install guilded.py==1.8.0
    pip3 install requests
    pip3 install urllib3==1.26.6
    ```

1.  Copy and save the following scripts corresponding to different parts of the bot logic in the same directory:

    ```python title="bot_config.py"
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = ""
    GUILDED_BOT_TOKEN = ""
    OPEN_CLOUD_API_KEY = ""
    ROBLOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET = ""

1.  On the **bot_config.py** file for main configuration of the bot:

    1. Set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or `GUILDED_BOT_TOKEN` to the token generated by your bot.
    2. Set `OPEN_CLOUD_API_KEY` as the API key you created.
    3. Set `ROBLOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` as the secret you set when configuring the webhook on Creator Dashboard.
    4. In `STANDARD_DATA_STORE_ENTRIES` and `ORDERED_DATA_STORE_ENTRIES` dictionaries for locating the data store of each record to delete:
       1. Add your copied Start Place IDs as keys.
       1. Add Universe IDs as the first element of the tuple value.
       1. Replace the second element of the tuple with the name, scope, entry key name, and associated User ID of your data stores. If you use a different data schema, modify to match your own data schema accordingly.

1.  The bot then starts to listen and verify Roblox webhooks for right to erasure Requests and calls the Open Cloud endpoint for deleting the corresponding data store.

<Alert severity="warning">
To ensure constant and secure execution of the scripts, save and run them locally only. Keep your local device or virtual machine running the scripts turned on at all times. In the event that your device goes offline, you need to manually manage any missed messages during the offline period and handle delivery failures according to the [retry policy](../../cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.md#delivery-failure-retry-policy).
</Alert>

## Testing

You can create and run a test message to verify that your custom program can properly handle right to erasure requests and delete PII data:

1. Send an HTTP `POST` request to your Guilded or Discord webhook server with the following request body:

   ```bash title="Example Request"
   curl -X POST {serverUrl}
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
   -d '{
      "embeds":[{
         "title":"RightToErasureRequest",
         "description":"You have received a new notification for Right to Erasure for the User Id: {userIds} in the game(s) with Ids: {gameIds}",
         "footer":{
            "icon_url":"https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/assets/webhooks/roblox_logo_metal.png",
            "text":"Roblox-Signature: {robloxSignature}, Timestamp: {timestamp}"
         }
      }]
   }'
   ```

2. If you have a webhook secret:
   1. Generate a `Roblox-Signature` by applying HMAC-SHA256 encoding to your webhook secret key.
   2. Set the current time using UTC timestamp in seconds as `Timestamp`.
3. Put together the `description` in the following format:

   ```plain title="Description Field Format"
   {Timestamp}. You have received a new notification for Right to Erasure for the User Id: {userId} in the game(s) with Ids: {gameIds}`.
   ```

   For example:

   ```plain title="Example Description Field"
   1683927229. You have received a new notification for Right to Erasure for the User Id: 2425654247 in the game(s) with Ids: 10539205763, 13260950955
   ```

Your program should be able to identify that your message is from the official Roblox source since you encoded the message with your secret. It should then delete the PII data associated with your request.

```json title="Example Body"
{
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "RightToErasureRequest",
      "description": "You have received a new notification for Right to Erasure for the User Id: 2425654247 in the game(s) with Ids: 10539205763, 13260950955",
      "footer": {
        "icon_url": "https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/assets/webhooks/roblox_logo_metal.png",
        "text": "Roblox-Signature: UIe6GJ78MHCmU/zUKBYP3LV0lAqwWRFR6UEfPt1xBFw=, Timestamp: 1683927229"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
