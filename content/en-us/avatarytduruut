**Create and sell avatar items.**

Every Roblox user is represented by a customizable character called an **avatar**. Avatars are character models with many specialized features that allow users to interact with [experiences](../platform.md) and customize themselves with a wide range of clothing and accessories from the [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog). Currently, only creators participating in the [UGC program](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) can upload and sell items on the Marketplace.
