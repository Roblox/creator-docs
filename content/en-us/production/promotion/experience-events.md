description: Explore how to create and promote time-based events for your experience.

As part of your [promotional](../../production/promotion/index.md) initiatives, the integrated **Events** system lets you create time-based events for your experience. Players can discover your events on the experience's detail page and through an [event details page](#event-details-page). Players can also opt into [notifications](#streampush-notifications) that they'll receive when your event begins.

## Creating Events

To create an event, you must have the [Edit all group experiences](../../projects/groups.md#roles-and-permissions) permission in a [group‑owned](../../projects/groups.md) experience, or be the sole owner of a user‑owned experience. Currently, you can publish a maximum of 10 ongoing or upcoming events.

1. Navigate to an experience's page on the [Creator Dashboard][creatordashboard].
2. In the left column, expand the **Engagement** branch and click **Events**.

3. Click the **Create Event** button and then, on the event creation screen:

   1. Enter the **event name**, a starting date/time, and an ending date/time.
   2. Select one or two **event types** from the dropdowns that accurately describe your event:

      <table size="small">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Event Type</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>**Content Update**</td>
          <td>An update that adds new items or pets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>**Location Update**</td>
          <td>An update that adds a new map.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>**System Update**</td>
          <td>An update that adds new features like trading.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>**Activity**</td>
          <td>An in-experience festival.</td>
        </tr>
	    </tbody>
	    </table>

   3. Enter a description following general [best practices](../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md#metadata-best-practices) to accurately portray the event. If you're using the event to promote a major experience update, summarize the key updates. If applicable, mention incentives for players to join such as exclusive event‑specific merch or [badges](../../production/publishing/badges.md) that may be earned during the event.
   4. Select a **privacy level**; public events will be viewable to all players while private events will only be visible by you and others with elevated access.

      <Alert severity="info">
      If you're not yet ready to publicize the event, set it as **private**. Later, when you're ready to begin promoting the event, change it to **public**. Private events and their event pages cannot be seen by users without access, and they will not appear on its experience's detail page.
      </Alert>

   5. Add one or more thumbnails to promote your event. The first thumbnail in the list will be used as the primary event thumbnail, so think carefully about what image you want to choose. If you don't add any thumbnails for the event, the [experience thumbnail](../../production/promotion/promotional-thumbnails.md) will be used.

4.  When ready, click **Publish Event** to save your event. If you set the event to public, it will be immediately discoverable on the experience's detail page.

1. On an experience's **Events** page, click the tab corresponding to the event's timing (**Active**, **Scheduled**, or **Finished**).

## Event Discovery

### Event Details Page

All published events feature an event details page which you can share with players on and off platform. To access a **shareable link**, you can use either the event details page itself or the **Events** page.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Event Details Page">
From the event details page, click/tap the **share** button below the event title to open your device's native sharing UI, or to copy the link to your clipboard.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Creator Dashboard">
From the experience's **Events** page, hover over the event thumbnail, click the **&ctdot;** button, and select **Copy&nbsp;Event&nbsp;Details&nbsp;URL**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Alert severity="warning">
Event pages persist even after an event ends, but players will no longer be able to join from the page. To remove an event page entirely, see [Deleting Events](#deleting-events).
</Alert>

### Experience Detail Page

All published events also appear in a dedicated **Events** section on the experience's detail page. Players can join active events directly through the **Join&nbsp;Event** button, or click **Notify&nbsp;Me** for upcoming events to receive stream notifications in their Roblox inbox and the ability to opt into [push notifications](#streampush-notifications).

### Group Page

If you create events as an admin for a [group](../../projects/groups.md), the group's events will appear under the **Events** tab on the group page.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-Events-Tab.jpg" width="840" alt="Event listed on group's page under the Events tab." />

In addition, you can feature an event in the group's **About** section for extra visibility:

1. Go to the group's **Events** tab.
2. Find the event you want to feature, click on the **&ctdot;** button, and select **Feature&nbsp;Event**.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-Feature-Event.jpg" width="720" alt="Feature Event button indicated on an event's tile on the group's page." />

   The event should now appear in the group page's **About** section:

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-About-Tab.jpg" width="720" alt="Event featured on group's page under the About tab." />

### Stream/Push Notifications

Players who click **Notify Me** for an upcoming event will receive stream notifications in their Roblox inbox when the event starts. In addition, they can opt into **push notifications** to receive a notification on their device that will take them into the experience. Stream notifications remain accessible in the player's Roblox inbox for the duration of the event, making it easy for them to hop back in at any time.
