title: Experience Events and Updates
description: Explore how to create and promote time-based events for your experience, as well as announce experience updates to opted-in users.
---

As part of your [promotional](../../production/promotion/index.md) initiatives, the integrated **events** system lets you create time‑based events for your experience. Players can discover your events on the experience's detail page and through an [event details page](#event-details-page), and they can opt into [notifications](#streampush-notifications) that they'll receive when your event begins.

In addition to events, the integrated [update announcements](#announcing-experience-updates) system lets you announce experience updates for which opted‑in players receive a notification in their Roblox notifications stream, along with a link to join the experience directly from the notification.

## Creating Events

To create an event, you must have the [Edit all group experiences](../../projects/groups.md#roles-and-permissions) permission in a [group‑owned](../../projects/groups.md) experience, or be the sole owner of a user‑owned experience. Currently, you can publish a maximum of 10 ongoing or upcoming events.

1. Navigate to an experience's page on the [Creator Dashboard][creatordashboard].
2. In the left column, expand the **Engagement** branch and click **Events&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Updates**.

   <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Nav-Engagement-Events-Updates.png" width="330" alt="Events and Updates button indicated for an experience on the Creator Dashboard" />

3. Click the **Create Event or Update** button.
4. Add a **thumbnail** to promote your event. If you don't add any thumbnails for the event, the primary [experience thumbnail](../publishing/thumbnails.md) will be used instead.

   <Alert severity="success">
   Using a unique event thumbnail that is different from your experience thumbnails will help to increase player engagement with the event.
	 </Alert>

5. Select an event **category** that most accurately describes your event. The category may be shown alongside your event thumbnail in certain places on Roblox.

6. Enter the event title, subtitle, and description. The description is optional but it can help provide additional information about the details of your event. If you supply a description, it should follow general [best practices](../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md#metadata-best-practices) and accurately portray the event, including:

   - A summary of the event and how it relates to the overall experience. If you're using the event to promote a major experience update, summarize the key updates.

   - Incentives for players to join such as exclusive event‑specific merch or [badges](../../production/publishing/badges.md) that may be earned during the event.

7. Set the starting date/time, and an ending date/time.
8. Select a privacy level; **public** events will be viewable to all players while **private** events will only be visible by you and others with elevated access.

   <Alert severity="info">
   If you're not yet ready to publicize the event, set it as **private**. Later, when you're ready to begin promoting the event, change it to **public**. Private events and their event pages cannot be seen by players without access, and they will not appear on its experience's detail page.
   </Alert>

9. When ready, click **Create** to save your event. If you set the event to public, it will be immediately discoverable on the experience's detail page.

   Assets which are pending review or are moderated will display a placeholder.
   </Alert>

## Event Discovery

The following sections detail how you can promote events and how events are discoverable by players on the Roblox platform.

### Event Details Page

All published events feature an event details page which you can share with players on and off platform. To access a **shareable link**, you can use either the event details page itself or the **Events** page.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Event Details Page">
From the event details page, click/tap the **share** button below the event title to open your device's native sharing UI, or to copy the link to your clipboard.
<img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Dedicated-Event-Page-Copy-URL.png" width="800" height="300" alt="Share button indicated on event details page" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Creator Dashboard">
From the experience's **Events** page, hover over the event thumbnail, click the **&ctdot;** button, and select **Copy&nbsp;Event&nbsp;Details&nbsp;URL**.
<img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Event-Context-Menu-Copy-Event-Details-URL.png" width="600" height="268" alt="Event's right-click context menu indicating the selection of Copy Event Details URL" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Alert severity="warning">
Event pages persist even after an event ends, but players will no longer be able to join from the page. To remove an event page entirely, see [Deleting Events](#deleting-events).
</Alert>

### Experience Detail Page

All published events also appear in a dedicated **Events** section on the experience's detail page. Players can join active events directly through the **Join&nbsp;Event** button, or click **Notify&nbsp;Me** for upcoming events to receive stream notifications in their Roblox inbox and the ability to opt into [push notifications](#streampush-notifications).

<img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Experience-Page-Promotion.png" width="840" alt="Event promoted on experience's detail page" />

### Group Page

If you create events as an admin for a [group](../../projects/groups.md), the group's events will appear under the **Events** tab on the group page.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-Events-Tab.jpg" width="840" alt="Event listed on group's page under the Events tab." />

In addition, you can feature an event in the group's **About** section for extra visibility:

1. Go to the group's **Events** tab.
2. Find the event you want to feature, click on the **&ctdot;** button, and select **Feature&nbsp;Event**.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-Feature-Event.jpg" width="720" alt="Feature Event button indicated on an event's tile on the group's page." />

   The event should now appear in the group page's **About** section:

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Group-Page-About-Tab.jpg" width="720" alt="Event featured on group's page under the About tab." />

### Stream/Push Notifications

Players who click **Notify Me** for an upcoming event will receive stream notifications in their Roblox inbox when the event starts. In addition, they can opt into **push notifications** to receive a notification on their device that will take them into the experience. Stream notifications remain accessible in the player's Roblox inbox for the duration of the event, making it easy for them to hop back in at any time.

</GridContainer>

## Deleting Events

To delete an event and remove its [detail page](#event-details-page):

1. On an experience's **Events &amp; Updates** page, click the tab corresponding to the event's timing (**Active**, **Scheduled**, or **Finished**).

   <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Nav-Engagement-Events-Updates.png" width="330" alt="Events and Updates button indicated for an experience on the Creator Dashboard" />

2. Hover over the event thumbnail, click the **&ctdot;** button, and select **Delete&nbsp;Event**.

   <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Event-Context-Menu-Delete-Event.png" width="600" alt="Event's right-click context menu indicating the selection of Delete Event" />

## Using Event Attribution

When a player joins an experience through an event entry point, such as by clicking on an event [notification](#streampush-notifications) or through the join button on the [event details page](#event-details-page), the event ID is added to the player's `GameJoinContext`. You can use this information in your experience to identify players who have come to participate in the event and show them custom prompts or otherwise personalize their experience.

```lua title="Script - Reading Event ID from GameJoinContext"
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	local source = player:GetJoinData()
	-- Check if the provided source is valid
	if source then
		-- Read eventId from GameJoinContext
		local eventId = source.GameJoinContext.EventId

		if eventId then
			print(player.Name, "joined from the event:", eventId)
		end
	end
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

## Announcing Experience Updates

<Alert severity="info">
Events and updates are currently in the process of being combined. Announcing updates still uses the old form, but that is subject to change in the future.
</Alert>

The integrated announcements system lets you notify [opted‑in](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/24769602332692-Out-of-Experience-Notifications) players about new and exciting updates. When you send an announcement, players receive a notification in their Roblox notifications stream, along with a link to launch the experience directly from the notification.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/experience-events/Notification-Update.png" width="700" alt="Example update announcement notification on the Roblox website" />

Updates have a limit of 60 characters and you can only announce an update once every three days. When drafting your update, consider the following best practices:

- Focus on announcing new, exciting, and accessible information, such
	as new areas, skills, and achievements.
- Be descriptive in your updates. Updates like "bug fixes" are vague
	and don't inform the reader of what was actually fixed.
- Avoid overwhelming players with too many updates in a short time
	period.

To announce an update:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
2. Click on the thumbnail of the experience you want to associate with the update. The experience's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the left-hand navigation, under **Engagement**, click **Events&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Updates**.

	 <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Nav-Engagement-Events-Updates.png" width="330" alt="Events and Updates button indicated for an experience on the Creator Dashboard" />

4. Click **Create Event or Update**.
5. At the top of the creation form, click on the link to the old updates page.
6. In the input field, describe what has been updated in your experience, then click the **Preview** button to see how the update will display for desktop, tablet, and phone users.
7. When ready, click the **Send** button. The update is sent to everyone who enabled notifications for your experience and it immediately displays in the **History** section of your **Updates** page with the sent date, the update message, and statistics related to the update's performance.

	 <img src="../../assets/promotion/misc/Updates-Listing.png" width="780" />

	 <table size="small">
	 <thead>
	 <tr>
	 <th>Statistic</th>
	 <th>Description</th>
	 </tr>
	 </thead>
	 <tbody>
	 <tr>
	 <td>**Views**</td>
	 <td>Number of people who have viewed the update.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>**Visit Rate**</td>
	 <td>Percentage of people who have visited the experience from the notification.</td>
	 </tr>
	 <tr>
	 <td>**Unfollow Rate**</td>
	 <td>Percentage of people who have unfollowed the experience from the notification.</td>
	 </tr>
	 </tbody>
	 </table>
