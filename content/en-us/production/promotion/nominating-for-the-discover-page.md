title: Nominating for the Discover Page
description: Explains the process of nominating your experience for specialized sort categories on the Discover page.
---

Sorts are collections of experiences that users see when they are
browsing the
[Discover](https://www.roblox.com/discover#/) page,
such as **Most Engaging**, **Up-and-Coming**, and **Roleplay**. While most sorts generate automatically, you can nominate your experiences to the
[Learn & Explore](#learn--explore-criteria) sort. Experiences you nominate
should have a consistent and active user base, be well-liked by the community,
and remain public to all users. Consequently, [Paid
Access](/production/monetization/paid-access) experiences are ineligible.

After you nominate an experience, wait at least 2 weeks before re-submitting a
nomination, as **it typically takes anywhere from 2-4 weeks to review
submissions**. When an experience is approved, you'll receive a direct message
on the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com). To avoid having to
resubmit a nomination, carefully review the criteria for each category to make
sure your submission applies to the correct category.

## Learn & Explore Criteria

The **Learn & Explore** sort highlights experiences that let users learn
in an engaging way. The Roblox Education team reviews all applications
in this sort category, and they may highlight accepted nominations on
the [Education Hub](https://education.roblox.com/en-us/)
or the [Roblox Education Twitter account](https://twitter.com/RobloxEdu).

An experience in the **Learn & Explore** sort must:

- Explore a **subject matter**, such as science, history, or math, or
  have **educational value** that is clear to an educator.
- Not allow users to encounter aggressive monetization as a part of
  their first time user experience. **Monetization should not
  detract** **from learning or gameplay**. For example, users cannot
  access large portions of content or gain an unfair advantage in
  gameplay due to monetization.
- Remain **appropriate for a classroom** for students of all ages,
  even if it contains advanced subject matter.
- Have a "Like" ratio above 50%, and maintain at least 15 concurrent
  users.

In addition, you and your team must have a recently clean moderation
history.

To ensure content is fresh, the Roblox Education team
occasionally rotates and refreshes this sort category. If an experience is
removed, you will receive prior notice and an opportunity to re-apply in the
future. The Education team is glad to offer feedback for experiences on a
case-by-case basis. For questions, contact <a href='mailto:education@roblox.com'>education@roblox.com</a>.
