title: Nominate for the Charts page
description: Explains the process of nominating your experience for specialized sort categories on the Charts page.
---

Sorts are collections of experiences that users see when they are
browsing the
[Charts](https://www.roblox.com/charts#/) page,
such as **Top Trending**, **Up-and-Coming**, and **Most Popular**. While most sorts generate automatically, you can nominate your experiences to the
[Learn & Explore](#learn--explore-criteria) sort. Experiences you nominate
should have a consistent and active user base, be well-liked by the community,
and remain public to all users. Consequently, paid
access in [Robux](../monetization/paid-access-robux.md) and [local currency](../monetization/paid-access-local-currency.md) experiences are ineligible.

After you nominate an experience, wait at least 2 weeks before re-submitting a
nomination, as **it typically takes anywhere from 2-4 weeks to review
submissions**. When an experience is approved, you'll receive a direct message
on the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com). To avoid having to
resubmit a nomination, carefully review the criteria for each category to make
sure your submission applies to the correct category.

## Learn & Explore criteria

The **Learn & Explore** sort highlights experiences that let users learn
in an engaging way. The Roblox Education team reviews all applications
in this sort category, and they may highlight accepted nominations on
the [Education Hub](https://education.roblox.com/en-us/)
or the [Roblox Education X (Twitter) account](https://x.com/RobloxEdu).

An experience in the **Learn & Explore** sort must:

- Explore a **subject matter**, such as science, history, or math, or
  have **educational value** that is clear to an educator.
- Not allow users to encounter aggressive monetization as a part of
  their first time user experience. **Monetization should not
  detract** **from learning or gameplay**. For example, users cannot
  access large portions of content or gain an unfair advantage in
  gameplay due to monetization.
- Remain **appropriate for a classroom** for students of all ages,
  even if it contains advanced subject matter.
- Have a "Like" ratio above 50%, and maintain at least 15 concurrent
  users.

In addition, you and your team must have a recently clean moderation
history.

<Alert severity="info">
To ensure content is fresh, the Roblox Education team
occasionally rotates and refreshes this sort category. If an experience is
removed, you will receive prior notice and an opportunity to re-apply in the
future. The Education team is glad to offer feedback for experiences on a
case-by-case basis. For questions, contact education@roblox.com.
