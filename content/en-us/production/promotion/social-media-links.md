Social media links connect your audience to your social media, which you
can use to market updates, monitor community feedback, and promote your
experiences. You can add up to 3 social media links. For compliance
reasons, **social links are only visible to 13+ users**.

To link to social media:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
2. Click on the thumbnail of the experience you want to associate with the user advertisement. The experience's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the left-hand navigation, under **Engagement**, click **Social Links**.
4. In the **Link Type** field, select the social media type you want to link to.
5. In the **URL** and **Title** fields, enter the URL to your social media and the descriptive text you want to display to users to tell them what you want to do.
6. <Chip label="OPTIONAL" size="small" variant="outlined" /> Click the **Add Link** button to add a second or third social link.
7. When ready, click the **Save** button. The social media links immediately display on your experience's main page.
