Social media links connect your audience to your social media, which you
can use to market updates, monitor community feedback, and promote your
experiences. You can add up to 3 social media links. For compliance
reasons, **social links are only visible to 13+ users**.

To link to social media:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
2. Click on the thumbnail of the experience you want to associate with the user advertisement. The experience's **Overview** page displays.
3. In the left-hand navigation, under **Engagement**, click **Social Links**.
