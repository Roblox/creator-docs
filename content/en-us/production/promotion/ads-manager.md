<Alert severity="info">
This feature is in beta.
</Alert>

The **Ads Manager** offers you control over your ad campaigns, empowering you to create, optimize, and measure ads effectively while reaching your campaign objectives. You can use this tool to manage your ad campaigns, ads reporting, and ads billings in one place.

With the [new Ads Manager](#manage-ads-new), you can create and manage ad campaigns for sponsored experiences that appear on a player's Home page.

With the [classic Ads Manager](#manage-ads-classic), you can create and manage ad campaigns for sponsored experiences, immersive ads inside experiences, and search ads that appear on Search results.

## Create an ad account

To access the Ads Manager, you must create an ad account with a verified email on a Roblox account registered for users aged 13 years or older.

When creating an account, you can choose between creating a personal or a business ads account. A personal account is for individuals who want to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.

To create an ad account:

1. Go to the [Ads Manager](https://ads.roblox.com) portal while signed into your Roblox account and **Create ad account**.
2. Choose a personal account or a business account.
3. Check the box to confirm the provided information and click **Create ad account**.

## Add a payment method

Before you can create and manage ads on Roblox, you must first add a payment method to your ad account:

1. Go to **Payment Settings** in the Ads Manager.
2. Choose one of the two available payment methods.
   1. **Credit or Debit Card**: Credit or debit cards are available for users 18 and above. A temporary \$1.00 USD hold will be placed on the card and refunded after verification is complete within 7 business days.
   2. **Robux Ad Credit**: Converting Robux into ad credits to fund your campaigns is available for all users 13 and up.

### Convert Robux to ad credits

Any Roblox user aged 13 and above can convert Robux to ad credit and use it for running ads. This accessibility ensures that a wide range of creators can participate in the advertising ecosystem.

You can specify the amount of ad credit you want to purchase. When converting Robux to ad credits, consider the following:

- 1 ad credit is equivalent to 263 Robux.
- 10 ad credits is the minimum conversion requirement.

This minimum conversion requirement streamlines the conversion process, prevents inaccuracies, and makes sure that you have enough ad credits to support meaningful advertising campaigns.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Credits.png" width="780" />

<Alert severity="warning">
   Converting Robux to ad credit is a permanent and irreversible action. After you convert Robux to ad credits, you can only spend your ad credits on ad campaigns within the Ads Manager.
</Alert>

## Manage ads (New)

<Alert severity="info">
   The new Ads Manager is currently only available for sponsored experiences.
</Alert>

The new Ads Manager simplifies campaign creation to help you reach more players and maximize the impact of your ads.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Budgets</h5>

When you create an ad campaign, you must set budgeting parameters to control campaign spending. There are two different types of budgets:

- A **daily budget** is the maximum amount you pay for your ads per day.
- A **lifetime budget** is the maximum amount you pay for your ads for the entire duration of the campaign.

You can pay for campaign budgets using either your debit or credit card on file, or your existing ad credit balance. If you fund a campaign with ad credits, you can't modify it after it's published. If you have unused ad credits after your campaign ends, those credits are refunded to your account.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Automated bidding</h5>

With auto-bidding, you set an ad budget and duration and Roblox automatically calculates the bid that will get you the most plays at the lowest cost.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Custom thumbnails</h5>

An ad creative is the thumbnail that shows up on a player's Home page when you sponsor an experience. You can select up to 5 thumbnails for your ad campaign, which are then evenly distributed across players' Home pages. After you create a campaign, you can edit the campaign to turn specific thumbnails on and off.

You can use existing thumbnail images you have previously uploaded to the Creator Hub, or upload new ad-specific images with the Ads Manager. Any image you use as a thumbnail is resized to a ratio of 16:9 when displayed on the Home page.

### Define the campaign

<Alert severity="warning">
Campaigns for experiences that are not unique can result in **no ad spend** and **no conversions**.

Experiences with metadata and place files that closely resemble existing experiences on Roblox are not prioritized for recommendations and might rank lower in search results. Campaigns for these experiences might not be effective.
</Alert>

To create an ad campaign with the new Ads Manager:

1. Go to **Manage Ads** and click **Create Campaign**.
2. Under **Experience**, select the experience you want players to join when they click on your ad.
3. Under **Goal & Name**, enter a campaign name and select one of the following goals for the campaign:
    - **Maximize Plays** to get the most plays at the lowest cost.
    - **Acquire New Users** to reach players who have either never played your experience before or who haven't played it in the last 180 days.
    - **Drive Retention** to turn visitors into regulars by re-engaging recent new players.
    - **Reactivate Users** to reach players who have played your experience in the last 180 days but who haven't played in the last 30 days.
4. Under **Budget & Schedule**:
    1. Choose between a **Daily Budget** and a **Lifetime Budget**.
    2. Select a **Payment Method**. If you're using ad credits, make sure the campaign budget does not exceed the available ad credits in your account.
    3. Set a **Duration** for your campaign.
    4. Set a **Start Date** and a **Start Time** for your campaign.
5. Under **Creative**, choose up to 5 thumbnails to show on players' Home page.
6. (Optional) Under **Audience Targeting**, customize the campaign's reach by only showing ads to players in specific locations and using specific devices.
7. Click **Publish** and confirm submission. Your ad campaign will go live after it's approved by the moderation team.

<Alert severity="info">
   Roblox tries to complete moderation within 24 hours for each ad submitted. Ads that do not pass moderation show the status of rejected.
</Alert>

## Manage ads (Classic)

The classic Ads Manager gives you a more detailed way to create ad campaigns, including defining targeting and bidding parameters for ad sets, and creating immersive and search ads.

An **ad campaign** is a coordinated series of ads designed to achieve a specific goal. To create an ad campaign with the Classic Ads Manager:

1. [Define the campaign](#define-the-campaign).
2. [Define an ad set](#define-an-ad-set).
3. [Create ads](#create-ads).

Before launching your campaign and submitting it to Roblox for moderation and approval, you'll be able to [review the campaign details](#review-the-campaign).

<Alert severity="warning">
   Advertising paid experiences and Restricted (18+) experiences is only available with sponsored and search ads.
</Alert>

### Define the campaign

Campaigns are defined by their **campaign objective** and **budgeting and scheduling** parameters. Campaign objectives are divided into three categories:

- **Awareness**: Campaigns focused on awareness show image or autoplaying video ads to increase awareness of your brand within an experience.
- **Visits**: Campaigns focused on visits aim to attract people to your experience on Roblox. These can take the form of either **sponsored experiences** on the Home page or **immersive ads** placed within portal ad units in experiences. You can't promote experiences with Restricted content maturity labels using the **Visits** objective.
- **Video Views**: Campaigns focused on 15-second click-to-play video views to engage audiences in-experience.

Budgeting and scheduling parameters control campaign spending and duration. There are two different types of budgets:

- **Daily budgets:** A daily budget is the maximum amount you pay for your ads per day.
- **Lifetime budgets:** A lifetime budget is the maximum amount you pay for your ads for the entire duration of the campaign.

You can't set both a daily and lifetime budget. Budgets are paid for by either your credit card on file or with existing ad credit balance.

To set up an ad campaign:

1. Go to **Manage Ads (Classic)** and click **Create**.
2. Select your **Payment Method**. If you're using ad credits, make sure the campaign budget does not exceed the available ad credits in your account. Ad credits are debited after campaign submission based on your set budget.
3. Select a **Campaign Objective** from the dropdown.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Objective.png" width="780" />

4. Choose a **Daily Budget** or **Lifetime Budget** for your campaign.
5. Choose the length of your campaign.

   - End dates are required for any campaign funded by ad credits.
   - End dates are optional for daily budgets with debit and credit cards. If you don't set an end date, the campaign runs indefinitely using the daily budget.

6. Enter a name for your campaign.
7. Click **Next**.

### Define an ad set

Ad sets are a group of ads within a campaign that share the same targeting and bidding parameters. When defining an ad set, you can customize the following three categories to meet the needs of your respective campaign goals:

- **Audience settings**: Choose who sees your ad based on their geographical location, gender, age, and what device they're playing on.
- **Ad placement**: Determine where your ads are discoverable on the platform, such as in search results or within experiences.

To define an ad set:

1. Choose up to 10 regions or countries you want your ad to appear in. When you target a region, you automatically target every country within that region.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Locations.png" width="780" />

2. Determine the gender and age range of the players you want to see your ads, as well as which devices you want your ads to appear on. Certain options might not be available in some locations.
3. Select where you want to place your ads according to your campaign objective.

   - For a **visits campaign objective**, choose between a sponsored experience on the Home page or an in-experience portal within an experience.
   - For an **awareness campaign objective**, choose between an in-experience video or image.
4. Choose which genres you want to target with your ads.

   - For sponsored experiences, this represents the genre interests of your audience.
   - For immersive ads, this represents the genre of the experiences your ads are displayed in.

5. Determine a max bid price to show your ads to players through the available ad units placed in experiences. Bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions), meaning that your max bid for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay for every thousand impressions.
6. Enter a name for your ad set.
7. Click **Next**.

To maximize your advertising reach and use both in-experience portals and sponsored experiences within the same campaign, consider creating an additional ad set. This flexibility enables you to experiment with different ad strategies and optimize your campaign's performance.

<Alert severity="info">
   When you define your ad set, an audience estimation displays that indicates how many Roblox user accounts your ads can reach over a month when applying your targeting parameters and placements. It estimates a maximum number of users on the platform who might be exposed to your ads, but does not take into consideration your budget limits or bidding parameters.
</Alert>

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Bidding and auction</h5>

Ads on Roblox work in a bidding system, where you bid to have your ads shown to users through the available ad units placed in an experience. When determining your bidding settings, bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions). Your max bid for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay every thousand times your ad is seen by the user. A higher CPM can increase the chances of winning the auction, but it also means you pay more.

At the same time, Roblox runs an auction to determine the best ad to show when there's an ad opportunity. You set the maximum price you're willing to pay as CPM or CPP (cost-per-play), then Roblox considers the player and ad information to generate an eCPM (effective cost-per-thousand impressions) value for each ad in the request.

All eligible ads participate in a **second price auction**. The ad with the highest bid wins the ad slot, but only charges the price of the second highest price plus one cent. This process looks like this:

1. You submit your bids for ad space.
2. Roblox calculates the eCPM value for each ad based on the player and ad information.
3. The ads are placed into an auction.
4. The ad with the highest eCPM value wins the auction.
5. The winning ad is displayed to the player.
6. You are charged the bid amount of the second highest price, plus one cent (\$0.01).

For example, you want to display your ad on a website so you submit a bid of \$10. Another advertiser submits a bid of \$12 for their own ad and wins the auction because their bid is higher. They're then charged \$10.01, which is the price of the second highest bid (in this case, your bid) plus one cent.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Genre targeting</h5>

Genre targeting helps you target your ads to reach people who are more likely to engage with your experience. You can use your ad sets to target particular genres.

<br />
<h6>Experience genre</h6>

Experience genres are based on the genre of the experiences your [immersive ads](../../production/monetization/immersive-ads.md) are served in. For example,selecting only "Roleplaying" means your ads only appear in experiences classified as "Roleplaying."<br />

<br />
<h6>Audience genre</h6>

For **sponsored experiences**, audience genre targeting is based on user preferences. Ads are only served to users who like to play experiences in the selected genres.

There are nine genres available for targeting:

- **Action**: Complete physical challenges that require motor skills like jumping, shooting, and climbing.
- **Adventure**: Use clues and interact with people or the environment to progress gameplay.
- **Obby**: Navigate a series of challenging obstacles to reach a goal or complete a task.
- **Roleplaying**: Assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting and have freedom to influence the story.
- **Simulation**: Experiences that closely simulate real world or fictional realities.
- **Social**: An environment where characters can meet connections, hangout, and socialize.
- **Sports**: Play traditional or fictional physical sports.
- **Strategy**: Focus on skillful thinking and planning to achieve success.
- **Tycoon**: Take on the role of a business owner and manage various aspects of the business to achieve success and profitability.

<Alert severity="warning">
   Audience genre targeting isn't available when buying sponsored experiences to reach audiences in the EU.
</Alert>

### Create ads

You can create three different types of ads using the Ads Manager:

- **Sponsored experiences**, which appear as sponsored experience tiles on the Home page.
- Immersive ads, which include:
  - **Portal ads**, which are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience, with a door that teleports a player into an advertiser's experience.
  - **Image ads**, which are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience.
  - **Video ads**, which are either auto-playing (non-rewarded) or click-to-play (can be rewarded) videos within the 3D space of an experience.
- **Search ads**, which allow you to promote your experience to users ages 13+ who are actively searching for experiences or genres of experiences using specific keywords.

The ad type is determined by your [campaign objective](#define-the-campaign). For example, campaign objectives valuing awareness are displayed as image ads, while campaign objectives valuing visits are displayed as tile and portal ads.

Roblox reviews each submitted ad prior to it being run. Make sure your ad is eligible to run by following the [advertising standards](./comply-with-advertising-standards.md).
