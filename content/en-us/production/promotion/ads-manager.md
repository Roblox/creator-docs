</Alert>

**Ads Manager** offers advertisers valuable control over their ad campaigns, empowering them to create, optimize, and measure ads effectively while reaching their campaign objectives. Advertisers can use this tool to manage their ad campaigns, ads reporting, and ads billings in one place.

## Creating an Ad Account

To access the Ads Manager, you need an ad account. Create an ad account with a verified email on a Roblox account registered for users aged 13 years or older.

When creating an account, users can choose between creating a personal or business account. A personal account is for individuals who wish to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.

To create an ad account:

1. Visit [ads.roblox.com](https://ads.roblox.com) while signed in to your Roblox account and select the **CREATE AD ACCOUNT** button.
2. Choose between a **Personal** or **Business** ad account. A personal account is for individuals who wish to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.
3. Check the box to confirm the provided information and click the **CREATE AD ACCOUNT** button. You'll receive a welcome letter at your verified email address confirming your account creation.

## Adding a Payment Method

Before you can create and manage ads on Roblox, you first need to provide a payment method. To add a payment method to your ad account:

1. Navigate to **Payment Settings** in the Ads Manager.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Menu-Payment-Settings.png" width="258" />

2. There are two payment methods available for selection:
   1. **Credit or Debit Card:** Credit or debit cards are available for users 18 and above. A temporary $1.00 USD hold will be placed on the card and refunded after verification is complete within 7 business days.
   2. **Robux Ad Credit:** Converting Robux into ad credits to fund your campaigns is available for all users 13 and up. For more information, see [Converting Robux to Ad Credits](#converting-robux-to-ad-credits).

### Converting Robux to Ad Credits

Any Roblox user aged 13 and above can convert Robux to ad credit and utilize it for running ads. This accessibility ensures that a wide range of creators can participate in the advertising ecosystem.

Advertisers can specify the amount of ad credit they wish to purchase. When converting Robux to ad credits, consider the following:

- 1 ad credit is equivalent to 285 Robux.
- 10 ad credits is the minimum conversion requirement.

This minimum conversation requirement streamlines the conversion process, prevents inaccuracies, and ensures that your ad credit balance is sufficient to support meaningful advertising campaigns.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/ad-credits.png" width="780" />

<Alert severity="warning">
   Converting Robux to ad credit is a permanent and irreversible action. Once you convert Robux to ad credits they can only be spent on campaigns within the Ads Manager.
</Alert>

## Creating Ad Campaigns

An **ad campaign** is a coordinated series of ads designed to achieve a specific goal. To create an ad campaign, you must do the following:

1. [Define the ad campaign](#define-the-campaign): Campaigns are defined by their campaign objectives, budget, and duration.
2. [Define ad sets](#define-ad-sets): An ad set is a group of ads within a campaign that shares the same targeting and bidding parameters.
3. [Create ads](#create-ads): Ads are the individual ads shown to players.

Before launching your campaign, you'll be able to [review your campaign details](#review-the-campaign) before submitting it to Roblox for moderation and approval.

### Define the Campaign

Campaigns are defined by their **campaign objective** and **budgeting and scheduling** parameters.

Campaign objectives are divided into two categories:

- **Awareness:** Campaigns focused on awareness show image ads to increase awareness of your brand. These are placed as image ads in-experience, appearing as virtual billboards.
- **Visits:** Campaigns focused on visits aim to attract people to your experience on Roblox. These can take the form as either immersive ads placed within immersive ad units in publisher experiences, or as sponsored experiences on the Home, Discover, and Search pages.

Budgeting and scheduling parameters control campaign spending and duration. There are two different types of budgets:

- **Daily budgets:** A daily budget is the maximum amount you'll pay for your ads per day.
- **Lifetime budgets:** A lifetime budget is the maximum amount you'll pay for your ads for the duration of the campaign.

You cannot set both a daily and lifetime budget. Budgets are paid by either your credit card on file or existing ad credit balance.

To set up an ad campaign:

1. Navigate to the **Campaign** tab in the Ads Manager and click the **CREATE** button. The **Campaign** window displays.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Create.png" width="780" />

2. Select your **Payment Method**. If using ad credits, ensure the campaign budget does not exceed the available ad credits within your account. Ad credits will be debited upon campaign submission based on your set budget.
   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/campaign-payment-method.png" width="780" />

3. Determine the **Campaign Objective** by selecting it in the dropdown.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Objective.png" width="780" />

4. Determine the **Daily Budget** or **Lifetime Budget** for your campaign. You cannot set both a daily and lifetime budget.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Budget-Schedule.png" width="780" />

5. Determine the length of your campaign by selecting the **End Date** field.
   - End dates are optional when using daily budgets for debit and credit cards. If an end date is not set, campaign will run indefinitely using the daily budget.
   - End dates are required for ad credit funded campaigns.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Set-End-Date.png" width="780" />

6. Name your campaign and click the **NEXT** button.
   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Campaign-Name-Next.png" width="780" />

### Define Ad Sets

**Ad sets** are a group of ads within a campaign that share the same targeting and bidding parameters. When defining an ad set, you can customize the audience, ad placement, and bidding settings.

**Audience** settings on Roblox enables you to choose who will see your ad. You're able to determine their geographical location, gender, age, and what device they're playing on.

**Ad placement** refers to where your ads will be discoverable.

- Advertisers with a visits campaign objective can choose between **immersive ads** placed within immersive ad units in publisher experiences, or as **sponsored experiences** on the Home, Discover, and Search pages.
- Advertisers with an awareness campaign objective can only choose an **in-experience billboard**.

**Bidding** refers to advertisers competing to show their ads to players through the available ad units placed in experiences. Bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions). Your **max bid** for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay every thousand impressions. For more information about Roblox's bidding system, see [Bidding and Auction](#bidding-and-auction).

To define an ad set:

1. Determine the regions you want your ad to appear in.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Locations.png" width="780" />

2. Determine the gender and age range of the players you wish to see your ads, as well as which devices you'd like your ads to appear on.
   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Gender-Ages-Devices.png" width="780" />

3. Select where your ad will appear, determined by your campaign objective.
    <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/ad-placement.png" width="780" />

4. Determine how you want to spend your budget. A higher CPM can increase the chances of winning the [auction](#bidding-and-auction), but it also means you'll pay more.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Bidding.png" width="780" />

5. Lastly, name your ad set and click the **NEXT** button.

   <img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Ad-Set-Name-Next.png" width="780" />

To maximize your advertising reach and use both in-experience portals and sponsored experiences within the same campaign, consider creating an additional ad set. This flexibility enables you to experiment with different ad strategies and optimize your campaign's performance.

#### Bidding and Auction

Ads on Roblox work in a bidding system, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown to users through the available ad units placed in an experience. When determining your bidding settings, bids are reflected as CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions). Your max bid for CPM is the maximum amount you're willing to pay every thousand times your ad is seen by the user.  A higher CPM can increase the chances of winning the auction, but it also means you'll pay more.

Coinciding with this, Roblox runs an auction to determine the best ad to show when there is an ad opportunity.  Advertisers set the maximum price they are willing to pay as CPM or CPP (cost per play). Roblox considers the player and ad information to  generate an eCPM (effective cost per thousand impressions) value for each ad in the request.

All eligible ads participate in a **second price auction**. The ad with the highest bid wins the ad slot, but only charges the price of the second highest price, plus one cent. In principle, this looks like:

1. Advertisers submit their bids for ad space.
2. Roblox calculates the eCPM value for each ad based on the player and ad information.
3. The ads are then placed into an auction.
4. The ad with the highest eCPM value wins the auction.
5. The winning ad is then displayed to the player.
6. The advertiser is charged its bid amount price.

As an example:

1. An advertiser wants to display their ad on a website.
2. The advertiser submits a bid of $10.
3. Another advertiser submits a bid of $12.

The second advertiser wins the auction and is charged $10.01, the price of the second highest bid, plus one cent.

### Create Ads

You can create three different types of ads using the Ads Manager:

- [Sponsored Experiences](#sponsored-experiences) appear as sponsored experience tiles on the Home, Discover, and Search pages.
- [Portal Ads](#portal-ads) are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience, with a door that teleports a player into an advertiser's experience.
- [Image Ads](#image-ads) are static, non-clickable images within the 3D space of an experience.

The **Ad Type** is determined by your [campaign objective](#define-the-campaign). Campaign objectives valuing **awareness** are displayed as image ads, while campaign objectives valuing **visits** are displayed as tile and portal ads.

Roblox reviews each submitted ad prior to it being run. Ensure your ad is eligible to run by following the [Roblox Advertising Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/13722260778260).

With your ad campaign, ad set, and individual ad created, it's time to review your selections. This final screen enables you to revisit any previous setting of your campaign and is required for review before launch. Once submitted, your ad is reviewed by moderators for approval.

<Alert severity="info">
Roblox tries to complete moderation within 24 hours for each ad submitted. Ads that do not pass moderation show the status of rejected. If you're curious why your ad got rejected, please refer to the [most up‑to‑date standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/13722260778260).

### Editing Campaigns

Once a campaign, ad set, or ad is submitted, an advertiser can make adjustments to certain parameters. To determine which parameters are changeable, consult the following table:

|Changeable|Fixed|
| --- | --- |
|Campaign name|Campaign objective|
|Campaign end and start dates|Campaign budget type|
|Campaign budget amount|Ad set bid type|
|Ad set bid amount|Ad set targeting parameters|
|Ad set name||
|Ad name||
|Ad type||

### Canceling a Campaign

If an advertiser wishes to retract a campaign for any reason, they have the option to cancel the campaign up to six hours before its scheduled start time. Cancellation is accessible at the campaign level and automatically cancels any associated ad sets and ads. This feature is available for campaigns with any payment method, and enables advertisers to recover their ad credits or prevent their credit or debit card from being charged.

You can't transfer ad credits associated with a specific campaign to another campaign. When a campaign is cancelled, Roblox applies the campaign's ad credits back to the account.

## Ads Reporting

**Ads reporting** is a tool that provides necessary information to effectively manage campaigns at the campaign, ad set, and individual ad level. Ads Manager utilizes click-based attribution for conversion tracking, ensuring accurate and transparent reporting. Ads reporting helps advertisers evaluate campaign performance, optimize strategies, and reach their campaign objectives.

- [Ad Campaign Reports](#ad-campaign-reports): Ads reporting at the campaign level offers insights into overall campaign effectiveness, enabling advertisers to compare and optimize various campaigns they have running simultaneously. This level provides a holistic view of performance, guiding budget allocation and strategy adjustments.
- [Ad Set Reports](#ad-set-reports): Ads reporting at the ad set level highlights targeting and budget effectiveness, enabling adjustments for better audience engagement. This level informs optimization for specific audiences.
- [Ad Reports](#ad-reports): Ads reporting at the individual ad level assesses creative impact, guiding design improvements. This level reveals ad resonance and informs creative refinements.

### Delivery Columns

The delivery column of the Ads Manager defines the **status** of your campaign, ad set, or ad.

- [Ad Campaign Statuses](#ad-campaign-statuses) offer a valuable overview of the campaign's overall progress, helping advertisers identify and optimize active, underperforming, or completed campaigns for better results.
- [Ad Set Statuses](#ad-set-statuses) highlight the performance of each ad set in terms of targeting and budget allocation, enabling advertisers to fine-tune their strategies for improved audience engagement and to reach their campaign objectives.
- [Ad Statuses](#ad-statuses) provide insights into the delivery status of each individual ad, allowing advertisers to monitor their effectiveness and note any dependencies on their parent ad sets or Campaigns.

You can use the following status tables to understand what each status means.

## Ads Billing

**Ads billing** charges advertisers for ad placements on Roblox using the [payment method on file](#adding-a-payment-method). Billing information can be found under **Payment Activity**.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Payment-Activity.png" width="360" />

### Credit and Debit Cards

There are two points at which an advertiser gets charged on Roblox when using a credit or debit card. The first is whenever an advertiser reaches their payment threshold, and the second is at the first of the month if the payment threshold is not reached. Ad spend using debit and credit cards has a daily limit of $300 USD.

Roblox advertisers have a payment threshold of $100 USD. Whenever an advertiser account accrues a balance of $100 through advertising on Roblox, their payment method on file is charged. If the payment threshold is not reached by the end of the month, the remaining outstanding balance is paid instead.

For example:

- An advertiser's account reaches the $100 payment threshold on May 7th due to their campaign parameters.
- Their payment method gets charged $100 on May 7th.
- If they accrue less than $100, their payment method gets charged the amount at the monthly billing cycle's close.

### Ad Credits

Campaigns using ad credit are settled at the end of the campaign at the end date. Any unused ad credits will be refunded to their ad credit balance. Ad credits will never be refunded to Robux. There is no daily spend limit when using ad credits.

For example:

- Advertiser sets 100 ad credit campaign running from 8/1 to 8/7.
- 100 of ad credits are debited.
- Campaign spends 75 by the end.
- The remaining 25 will be refunded in ad credits.

Ad credit-related activities are categorized as follows:

- **Purchased Ad Credit:** Transactions related to converting Robux into ad credit. This transparent categorization ensures that you can easily track your ad credit acquisition.
- **Funded:** Ad credit allocated towards a campaign. Tracking this allocation allows you to monitor your campaign budget and spending.
- **Unused:** Ad Credit allocated to a specific campaign but not used, which is returned on the campaign end date. This feature ensures that your ad credits are efficiently utilized and returned when appropriate.
- **Ad Fraud Refund:** Any refunds applied back to your account. Refunds credited for a specific campaign remain locked to that campaign, not credited at the account level.

## Ad Fraud Protection

Roblox diligently combats ad fraud using advanced detection methods for bots and other fraudulent activities, ensuring advertisers don't pay for fraudulent traffic and regularly adjusts billing and reporting to safeguard their interests. After 14 days from the campaign end date, campaigns are analyzed for fraudulent traffic, and transaction amounts are refunded accordingly. This proactive approach helps maintain the integrity of your campaigns and ensures fair spending.

Roblox may suspend ad campaigns or advertiser accounts for non-payment of services properly rendered. To avoid fraudulent behavior and maintain advertising integrity, advertisers should follow these best practices:

- Do not attempt to upload malware to the Roblox Ad Manager.
- Do not provide false identification or payment information to Roblox.
- Do not make fraudulent refund requests or dispute payments for services properly rendered.
