## Set up an ad account

To access the Ads Manager, you must set up an ad account with a verified email on a Roblox account registered for users aged 13 years or older.

When setting up an account, you can choose between creating a personal or a business ads account. A personal account is for individuals who want to advertise on Roblox, while a business account manages a company's ad presence on Roblox.

To set up an ad account:

1. Create an ad account.
   1. Go to the [Ads Manager](https://ads.roblox.com) portal while signed into your Roblox account and click **Create ad account**.
   2. Choose a personal account or a business account.
   3. Check the box to confirm your information and click **Create ad account**.
2. Add a payment method to your ad account.
   1. Go to **Bills & Payments** > **Payment Settings**.
   2. Click **Add Payment Method**.
   3. Attach a credit or debit card to your account or buy ad credits.
      - To add a card to your account, select the **Card** tab, enter your information, and click **Save and Authenticate**. This option is available for users 18 and above. A temporary $1.00 USD hold will be placed on the card and refunded after verification is complete within 7 business days.
      - To buy ad credits, select the **Robux Ad Credit** tab, enter the amount of credits you want to purchase, and click **Buy**. You must buy a minimum of 1 ad credit. Converting Robux into ad credits to fund your campaigns is available for all users 13 and up.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Robux to ad credit conversion</h5>

<Alert severity="error">
   Converting Robux to ad credit is a permanent and irreversible action. Once you convert Robux to ad credits, you can only spend your ad credits on ad campaigns within the Ads Manager.
</Alert>

Any Roblox user aged 13 and above can convert Robux to ad credits and use it for running ads. This accessibility ensures that a wide range of creators can participate in the advertising ecosystem.

When converting Robux to ad credits, consider the following:

- 1 ad credit is equivalent to 263 Robux.
- 1 ad credit is the minimum conversion requirement.

This minimum conversion requirement streamlines the conversion process, prevents inaccuracies, and makes sure that you have enough ad credits to support meaningful advertising campaigns.

## Manage your ads

Use the Ads Manager to create and manage ad campaigns for your experiences. With this tool, you can set budgets, select creatives, and control delivery settings while monitoring and adjusting your campaigns over time.

### Ad campaign components

Ad campaigns are made up of a few core components that control how your ads are delivered, how much you spend, and what players see.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Automated bidding</h5>

With auto-bidding, you set an ad budget and duration and Roblox automatically calculates the bid that will get you the most plays at the lowest cost.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Budgets</h5>

When you create an ad campaign, you must set budgeting parameters to control campaign spending. There are two different types of budgets:

- A **daily budget** is the maximum amount you pay for your ads per day.
- A **lifetime budget** is the maximum amount you pay for your ads for the entire duration of the campaign.

You can pay for campaign budgets using either your debit or credit card on file, or your existing ad credit balance. If you fund a campaign with ad credits, you can't modify it after it's published. If you have unused ad credits after your campaign ends, those credits are refunded to your account.

During campaign creation, you can enable **auto-reload** to automatically purchase ad credits when your account runs out. When auto-reload is triggered, Roblox reloads one day's worth of ad credits, and continues to reload daily as needed to keep your campaign running.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Creatives</h5>

An ad creative is the thumbnail that shows up on a player's Home page when you sponsor an experience. You can select up to 10 thumbnails for your ad campaign, which are then evenly distributed across players' Home pages. After you create a campaign, you can edit the campaign to turn specific thumbnails on and off.

You can use existing thumbnail images you have previously uploaded to the Creator Hub, or upload new ad-specific images with the Ads Manager. Any image you use as a thumbnail is resized to a ratio of 16:9 when displayed on the Home page.

### Create an ad campaign

<Alert severity="info">
Your ad campaign is automatically shown in both the Home page and search results.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Ad campaigns for experiences that are not unique can result in **no ad spend** and **no conversions**.

Experiences with metadata and place files that closely resemble existing experiences on Roblox are not prioritized for recommendations and might rank lower in search results. Campaigns for these experiences might not be effective.
</Alert>

To create an ad campaign:

1. Go to **Manage Ads** and click **Create Campaign**.
2. Under **Experience**:
   1. Select the experience you want players to join when they click on your ad.
   2. Enter a name for the campaign.
3. Under **Goal**, select a goal for the ad campaign:

   <table>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
      <td>**Plays**</td>
      <td>Reach the players most likely to stay engaged with your experience.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>(Coming soon) **Earnings**</td>
      <td>Reach the players most likely to spend money inside your experience.</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

4. Under **Audience**:
   1. Select an audience for the ad campaign:

      <table>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>**All Players**</td>
         <td>Show ad to all players, regardless of their past activity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>**New Players**</td>
         <td>Show ad to players who have never played your experience, or who haven’t played it in 180+ days.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>**Recent Players**</td>
         <td>Show ad to players who have played your experience in the last 30 days. Only available for experiences with 10,000 recent players or more.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>**Lapsed Players**</td>
         <td>Show ad to players who played your experience 30 to 180 days ago but haven’t returned. Only available for experiences with 20,000 lapsed players or more.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

   2. <Chip label="OPTIONAL" size="small" variant="outlined" /> Under **Advanced Targeting**, narrow down your audience by customizing settings like location, age, gender, genre, and device type.
5. Under **Budget & Duration**:
    1. Choose between a **Daily Budget** and a **Lifetime Budget**.
    2. Select a **Payment Method**. If you're using ad credits, make sure the campaign budget does not exceed the available ad credits in your account.
    3. Set a **Start Date** and a **Start Time** for your campaign.
    4. Set a **Duration** for your campaign.
    5. <Chip label="OPTIONAL" size="small" variant="outlined" />If you're using ad credits, enable **auto-reload** to automatically add ad credits to the campaign when your budget runs out.
6. Under **Creatives**, choose up to 10 thumbnails to show players.
7. Click **Publish** and confirm submission. Your ad campaign will go live after it's approved by the moderation team.

<Alert severity="info">
   Roblox tries to complete moderation within 24 hours for each ad submitted. Ads that do not pass moderation show the status of **rejected**.
</Alert>

### Edit an ad campaign

After a campaign is published, you can edit some fields while others are fixed:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>**Changeable**</th>
    <th>**Fixed**</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Campaign name</td>
    <td>Goal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Budget amount</td>
    <td>Audience</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Schedule</td>
    <td>Budget type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Creatives</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Cancel an ad campaign

You can cancel a campaign up to 6 hours before the campaign's scheduled start time.

Cancelling a campaign automatically cancels any associated ads, returns any ad credits you spent back to your account, and prevents your credit or debit card from being charged.

## Reporting

Reports provide insights into the overall effectiveness of your ad campaigns. You can use reporting data to compare performance across campaigns and identify opportunities to optimize.

To view your reports, go to **Manage Ads** and select the date range and experience you want to analyze.

The reporting metric cards include:

  <tr>
    <th>**Metric card**</th>
    <th>**Description**</th>

## Billing

The ads billing tool charges you for ad placements on Roblox using the payment method you have on file. To view billing information, go to **Billing & Payments** > **Payment Activity**.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Credit and debit cards</h5>

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
For first-time credit card users, \$5 USD will be charged upon campaign submission and used toward your first bill. Any unused balance will be refunded.
</Alert>

You can get charged at two different points when you use a credit or debit card:

- When you reach your payment threshold
- On the first of the month if the payment threshold isn't reached

Your account has a payment threshold that increases as you spend more on ads. When your ad spend reaches this threshold, your payment method on file is charged automatically.

For example, if your account has a threshold of \$100 USD, your payment method is charged when your accrued ad spend reaches \$100. If you don't reach the threshold by the end of the month, any remaining balance is charged at the close of the monthly billing cycle.

This means that if your campaigns reach the \$100 threshold on May 7, your payment method is charged \$100 on May 7. If your spend stays below $100, you're charged the outstanding amount at the end of the month instead.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Ad credits</h5>

Ad credits are deducted in real time as your campaigns spend. Once per day, the total ad credit spend across all of your campaigns is combined into a **single daily charge**, which appears in your ad credit transaction history. Until this daily charge is finalized, any ad credit spend appears as **Pending** in your transaction history.

Ad credits can have the following states:

- **Purchased Ad Credit:** Transactions related to converting Robux into ad credit. This transparent categorization makes sure that you can easily track your ad credit acquisition.
- **Funded:** Ad credit allocated towards a campaign. Tracking this allocation allows you to monitor your campaign budget and spending.
- **Unused:** Ad credit allocated to a specific campaign but not used, which is returned on the campaign end date. This feature makes sure that your ad credits are used efficiently and returned when appropriate.
- **Ad Fraud Refund:** Any refunds applied back to your account. Refunds credited for a specific campaign remain locked to that campaign, not credited at the account level.

<h5 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Ad fraud protection</h5>

Roblox uses advanced detection methods for bots and other fraudulent activities to make sure that you don't pay for fraudulent traffic, and regularly adjusts billing and reporting to safeguard their interests. After 14 days from the campaign end date, campaigns are analyzed for fraudulent traffic, and transaction amounts are refunded accordingly. If invalid traffic is detected, refunds are applied 16 days after the campaign end date. This proactive approach helps maintain the integrity of your campaigns and ensures fair spending.

Accounts responsible for ad fraud have their accounts suspended to prevent ongoing abuse. In addition, Roblox might suspend ad campaigns or advertiser accounts for non-payment of services properly rendered. Roblox expects you to act with integrity and follow the [advertising standards](./comply-with-advertising-standards.md).
