Use the reporting and billing tools in the Ads Manager to effectively manage your ad campaigns.

## Reporting

The ads reporting tool provides the information necessary to manage ad campaigns at the campaign, the ad set, and the individual ad level. This allows you to evaluate campaign performance, optimize strategies, and reach your campaign objectives.

Ads Manager provides accurate and transparent reporting through the use of click-based attribution for conversion tracking.

- [Ad campaign reports](#ad-campaign-reports) offer insights into overall campaign effectiveness and enable you to compare and optimize various campaigns you have running at the same time. The campaign report level provides a holistic view of performance, guiding budget allocation and strategy adjustments.
- [Ad set reports](#ad-set-reports) highlight targeting and budget effectiveness and enable you to make adjustments to improve audience engagement. The ad set report level provides information on how to optimize ads for specific audiences.
- [Individual ad reports](#individual-ad-reports) assess creative impact and help guide design improvements.

### Delivery columns

The delivery column of the Ads Manager defines the **status** of your campaign, ad set, or individual ad.

- The [ad campaign status](#ad-campaign-status) offers a valuable overview of the campaign's overall progress, helping you identify and optimize active, underperforming, or completed campaigns for better results.
- The [ad set status](#ad-set-status) highlights the performance of each ad set in terms of targeting and budget allocation, enabling you to fine-tune your strategies for improved audience engagement and to reach your campaign objectives.
- The [individual ad status](#individual-ad-status) provides insights into the delivery status of each individual ad, allowing you to monitor their effectiveness and note any dependencies on their parent ad sets or campaigns.

## Billing

The ads billing tool charges you for ad placements on Roblox using the payment method you have on file. To view billing information, go to **Billing Center** > **Payment Activity**.

### Credit and debit cards

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
For first-time credit card users, $5 USD will be charged upon campaign submission and used toward your first bill. Any unused balance will be refunded.
</Alert>

You can get charged at two different points when you use a credit or debit card:

- When you reach your payment threshold
- On the first of the month if the payment threshold isn't reached

The ad spend daily limit of credit and debit cards is $300 USD.

The payment threshold for Roblox advertisers is $100 USD. Whenever an advertiser account accrues a balance of $100 through advertising on Roblox, the payment method on file is charged. If the payment threshold is not reached by the end of the month, the remaining outstanding balance is paid instead.

For example, if your account reaches the $100 payment threshold on May 7th due to their campaign parameters, your payment method gets charged $100 on May 7th. If you accrue less than $100, your payment method gets charged the amount at the monthly billing cycle's close.

<img src="../../assets/promotion/ads-manager/Payment-Activity-1.png" width="780" />

### Ad credits

Campaigns using ad credit are settled at the end of the campaign at the end date. Any unused ad credits are refunded to their ad credit balance within 24-48 hours after the campaign ends. Ad credits are never refunded to Robux.

There is no daily spend limit when using ad credits.

For example, if you set a 100 ad credit campaign to run from 8/1 to 8/7, 100 ad credits are debited from your account. But if the campaign has only spent 75 ad credits by the end, the remaining 25 credits are refunded in ad credits.

The following are ad credit-related activities:

- **Purchased Ad Credit:** Transactions related to converting Robux into ad credit. This transparent categorization makes sure that you can easily track your ad credit acquisition.
- **Funded:** Ad credit allocated towards a campaign. Tracking this allocation allows you to monitor your campaign budget and spending.
- **Unused:** Ad credit allocated to a specific campaign but not used, which is returned on the campaign end date. This feature makes sure that your ad credits are used efficiently and returned when appropriate.
- **Ad Fraud Refund:** Any refunds applied back to your account. Refunds credited for a specific campaign remain locked to that campaign, not credited at the account level.

## Ad fraud protection

Roblox uses advanced detection methods for bots and other fraudulent activities to make sure that you don't pay for fraudulent traffic, and regularly adjusts billing and reporting to safeguard their interests. After 14 days from the campaign end date, campaigns are analyzed for fraudulent traffic, and transaction amounts are refunded accordingly. If invalid traffic is detected, refunds are applied 16 days after the campaign end date. This proactive approach helps maintain the integrity of your campaigns and ensures fair spending.

Accounts responsible for ad fraud have their accounts suspended to prevent ongoing abuse. In addition, Roblox might suspend ad campaigns or advertiser accounts for non-payment of services properly rendered. Roblox expects you to act with integrity and follow the [advertising standards](./comply-with-advertising-standards.md).
