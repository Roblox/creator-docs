If you previously used this feature while it was still in beta, make sure to implement the new [customized reward banners](#create-a-reward-banner) to maximize the reach of your friend referral system. Your users will be able to see the customized banners in mid-April 2025.

The friend referral system encourages existing players to bring new players into your experience, increasing player retention and overall engagement. Players can access and share referral links from [player invite prompts](./invite-prompts.md) or directly from the default in-experience invite menu.

As a developer, you can create customized banners to advertise your reward system and use shareable referral links to:

- Track which players have successfully invited other players into your experience.
- Track which players have joined your experience using a referral link invitation from another player.
- Create and distribute rewards to both inviters and invitees.

To implement a referral system, [set up a referral event](#set-up-a-referral-event) and [create referral rewards](#grant-referral-rewards) in Studio. The `ReferredByPlayerId` property of `Class.Player:GetJoinData()|GetJoinData()` automatically populates for all types of invitations and gives you access to the user ID of the referring player. You can then access this data in the `Players.PlayerAdded` event to identify the inviter and grant rewards to both the inviter and the invitee.

```lua
function onPlayerAdded(player)

	local referredByPlayerId = player:GetJoinData().ReferredByPlayerId

	local referrerEvent: RemoteEvent = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("ReferralReceivedEvent")
	referrerEvent:FireClient(player, referredByPlayerId)
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

To make sure that players understand the reward system, [implement a customized reward banner](#create-a-reward-banner) at the top of your friend invite modal showing them details about the rewards they can earn.

## Set up a referral event

To set up a referral event:

1. Set up a `RemoteEvent` in `ReplicatedStorage` to create a remote event to communicate with the client when a referral is received.
2. Retrieve the inviter's user ID using `ReferredByPlayerId` to track player joins and handle the referral logic in your server-side script during the `Players.PlayerAdded` event.

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

-- Create or get the RemoteEvent for handling referrals
local referrerEvent: RemoteEvent = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("ReferralReceivedEvent")

-- Function that triggers when a player joins
function onPlayerAdded(player)
    local joinData = player:GetJoinData()
    local referredByPlayerId = joinData.ReferredByPlayerId

    -- Check if the player was invited through a referral
    if referredByPlayerId and referredByPlayerId ~= 0 then
        -- Fire the referral event to the client, passing the inviter's ID
        referrerEvent:FireClient(player, referredByPlayerId)

        -- Additional logic for rewarding inviter and invitee can be added here
        -- e.g., rewardReferrer(referredByPlayerId)
        -- e.g., rewardInvitee(player)
    end
end

-- Connect the function to the PlayerAdded event
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

## Grant referral rewards

To encourage participation, grant rewards to both inviters and invitees. For example, you can give inviters a badge or in-experience currency when their friend joins the experience, and give invitees a welcome reward for joining the experience through a referral link.

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

-- Create or get the RemoteEvent for handling referrals
local referrerEvent: RemoteEvent = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("ReferralReceivedEvent")

-- Function that triggers when a player joins
function onPlayerAdded(player)
    local joinData = player:GetJoinData()
    local referredByPlayerId = joinData.ReferredByPlayerId

    -- Check if the player was invited through a referral
    if referredByPlayerId and referredByPlayerId ~= 0 then
        -- Fire the referral event to the client, passing the inviter's ID
        referrerEvent:FireClient(player, referredByPlayerId)

        -- Reward the inviter
        function rewardReferrer(referrerId)
          local referrerPlayer = Players:GetPlayerByUserId(referrerId)
          if referrerPlayer then
              -- Grant the inviter their reward
              -- Example: referrerPlayer.leaderstats.Coins.Value += 100
          end
        end

        -- Reward the invitee
        function rewardInvitee(player)
            -- Grant the invitee their reward
            -- Example: player.leaderstats.WelcomeBonus.Value += 50
        end
    end
end

-- Connect the function to the PlayerAdded event
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

## Create a reward banner

Reward banners encourage users to invite friends to join your experience by showing them details about the referral rewards they can earn. These banners are displayed at the top of your friend invite modal.

To create a customized reward banner:

1. In the Creator Hub, go to **Creations** and select the experience that you have set up a referral event for.
2. Go to **Engagement** > **Referral Rewards**.
3. Click **Add Reward Details**.
4. In the **Referral Rewards** page:
    1. Replace the default icon with an image that represents your experience.
    2. Enter a reward name to display on the banner.
    3. Select a start and end date for when you want to show the banner to players.
    4. (Optional) Enter a description with details about the reward.
    5. (Optional) If you want to add reward restrictions, enter a reward limit. For example, a limit of up to 3 rewards per inviter.
5. Click **Save** to save your changes.
6. Click **Publish** to make the banner visible to players.

You can create many different banners, but only one banner can be published and shown at a time. Make sure that the published banner accurately describes the referral system you have implemented in Studio.

## Prevent referral system abuse

You can implement safeguards to prevent players from exploiting the friend referral system.

- Offer one-time rewards to track invitees and make sure they're only rewarded once.
- Introduce a cooldown period before an inviter can submit another referral.
- Monitor unusual activity and implement corrective measures like banning users or canceling rewards.

```lua
-- Table to track players who have already been referred
local referredPlayers = {}

function onPlayerAdded(player)
    local joinData = player:GetJoinData()
    local referredByPlayerId = joinData.ReferredByPlayerId

    -- Check if the player was invited and has not already used a referral
    if referredByPlayerId and referredByPlayerId ~= 0 and not referredPlayers[player.UserId] then
        -- Mark the player as referred
        referredPlayers[player.UserId] = true

        -- Reward inviter and invitee
        rewardReferrer(referredByPlayerId)
        rewardInvitee(player)
    end
end
```

## Best practices

Follow the best practices to get the most out of your friend referral system.

- To encourage players in your experience to take advantage of referrals, add an in-experience button to advertise the referral system. Give the button a descriptive title and connect the button click event to the friend invite modal where players can see the reward banner.
- Update the title and description of your experience to include the referral system. For example, you can add "[Referral reward live]" to your experience's title to make players who are browsing Roblox aware of referral rewards.
