## Our approach to global compliance

As a global platform, we are committed to respecting the local requirements of the countries in which we operate. This commitment is a core part of our long-term strategy to maintain a presence in nearly every country, allowing creators to reach the widest possible audience.

## Why is my content unavailable in certain regions?

Content availability can change based on regional requirements. At times, we may receive requests to restrict certain types of content in a specific country, as well as requests to restrict a particular experience or avatar item in a specific country.

## What does this mean for my content?

When content is restricted in a specific country, the following changes occur:

- **Experiences**: Impacted experiences will be neither discoverable nor playable by users in that country.
- **Avatar items**: Impacted avatar items will be undiscoverable and taken off-sale for users in that country.

Your content’s status in other countries remains unchanged, and your global engagement and analytics in other regions will continue as usual.

Our approach to content availability is not static; it is subject to the ongoing evolution of requirements worldwide. Content that was once restricted may become available, and new requirements may be introduced.
