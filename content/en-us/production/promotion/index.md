**Promotion** on Roblox allows you to engage a global audience to drive traffic and awareness to your experiences, avatar items, and social media.

All promotional content on the platform must adhere to Roblox's [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846), and if your promotional content is advertising, it must also adhere to Roblox's [Advertising Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/13722260778260). For information on how all advertising works on the platform, including details for both advertising campaigns using Roblox's promotion products, and compliant independent advertising campaigns for experiences, see [Advertise on Roblox](../../production/promotion/advertise-on-roblox.md) and [Comply with advertising standards](../../production/promotion/comply-with-advertising-standards.md).

## Social media

[Social media links](./social-media-links.md) are links to your social media channels. Use social media links to promote your social media presence by embedding these links on your experience details page.

## Share links

[Share links](./share-links.md) are links to your Roblox experiences. Use share links on your social media to promote your Roblox experiences and to track metrics for acquisition through off-platform channels.

Unlike social media links, which direct users to your social media channels, share links promote and direct users to your Roblox experiences.

## Communities

[Communities](../../projects/groups.md) can serve as a form of marketing for the experiences that you publish through them. Users playing an experience often engage with the creator of the experience, which in this case is the group page. Here, users can find social links, follow related communities for new content, and post on comment boards.

Some recommendations for this page include:

- Ensure your community is named after your studio or company.
- Use thumbnails and descriptions to communicate your brand and identity.
- Include social links, such as YouTube, Discord, or X (Twitter).
