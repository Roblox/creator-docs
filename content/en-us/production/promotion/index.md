</Alert>

**Promotion** on Roblox allows you to engage a global audience to drive traffic and awareness to your experiences, avatar items, and social media. There are several ways you can market your content to users when and where they're most likely to engage with it:

- **Promote your experiences** – Engage users in special sort categories or search results when they're browsing the Discover page, in immersive portal ads in an experience they're already accessing, through time-based events, or in a highlight as they're watching a Roblox-owned channel.
- **Promote your avatar items** – Engage users as they're looking at any item's main details page or the Sponsored sort category on the Marketplace, or in immersive image ads in an experience they're already accessing.
- **Promote your social media** – Engage users as they're looking at your experience's main details page to follow you on social media for development updates.

All promotional content on the platform must adhere to Roblox's [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846), and if your promotional content is advertising, it must also adhere to Roblox's [Advertising Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/13722260778260). For information on how all advertising works on the platform, including details for both advertising campaigns using Roblox's promotion products, and compliant independent advertising campaigns for experiences, see [Advertising on Roblox](../../production/promotion/advertising-on-roblox.md) and [Complying with Advertising Standards](../../production/promotion/complying-with-advertising-standards.md).

## Social Media

You can direct users to follow you on social media by embedding social media links on your experience's main details page. Social media links connect your audience over the age of 13 to your social media outside of Roblox, which you can use to market updates, monitor community feedback, and promote your experiences. For more information, see [Growing Your Audience](../../production/promotion/growing-your-audience.md#linking-to-social-media).
