Thumbnails appear at the top of your experience's main page, allowing you to further promote your experience, showcase its features, and announce updates and events. They are the first images and videos users see after clicking on your [experience icon](../../production/publishing/experience-icons.md).

There are two types of thumbnails that you can use to market your experience:

- **Image** &mdash; Supplements the experience icon, such as screenshots of gameplay or slides that demonstrate key details of your experience. Free to upload.

- **Video** &mdash; Links directly to YouTube. Many creators use this type of thumbnail to display trailers. Moderation cost of **500&nbsp;Robux**.

## Capturing Thumbnails in Free Camera Mode

Free camera mode is a useful tool to capture in-experience screenshots and videos because it allows you to move the camera to positions that aren't possible when testing or playing under normal circumstances. To enable free camera mode:

1. Navigate to an experience where you have server-side developer console access.

2. In the **Home** tab of the menu bar, navigate to the **Test** section and click **Play**.

3. Press <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd>.

Once in free camera mode, you can use the following controls:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Keys/Shortcuts</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera forward/left/back/right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera down/up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    <td>In combination with any movement key, changes the camera speed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
