title: Experience Thumbnails
description: Thumbnail images and videos appear at the top of an experience's main page to showcase features and share information.
---

Thumbnails appear at the top of your experience's main page, allowing you to further showcase its features and announce updates or events. They are the primary promotional images/videos that users see on your experience's main page, and the **first** image thumbnail is used as the promotional image in various sections of the [Home](https://www.roblox.com/home) page.

<Alert severity="success">
While thumbnails help users know what your experience offers, [icons](../publishing/experience-icons.md) remain important to help users recognize your experience and grow its brand.
</Alert>

There are two types of thumbnails that you can use to promote your experience:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Image**</td>
    <td>Supplements the experience [icon](../publishing/experience-icons.md) and helps users know what your experience offers. Ideally showcases in‑experience mechanics, assets, and gameplay. The first image thumbnail is used as the promotional image in various sections of the [Home](https://www.roblox.com/home) page.</td>
		<td>**free**</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>**Video**</td>
    <td>Links directly to YouTube. Many creators use this type of thumbnail to display trailers.</td>
		<td>500&nbsp;Robux</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Uploading

You can add up to 10 images or YouTube video links per experience from the **Thumbnails** page of the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations). All uploaded images and linked videos will be moderated to ensure they adhere to the [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).

<Alert severity="success">
Note that the **first** image thumbnail in the [ordered sequence](#ordering) is used as the experience's promotional image in various sections of the [Home](https://www.roblox.com/home) page, so it should follow the recommended [best practices](#best-practices).
</Alert>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Images">

When you're creating an image to upload, use a template of **1920×1080 pixels** and export it in `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.png`, `.tga`, or `.bmp` format.

1. Set the media type to **Image** and click the **Upload Image** button. Then, from the file browser, select and confirm the image you want to use as the thumbnail.

   <img src="../../assets/creator-dashboard/Experience-Thumbnail-Media-Type-Image.png" width="400" />

1. **(Recommended)** Add an **Alt Text** description of your thumbnail so it's accessible to everyone. The description should be concise and describe your thumbnail accurately enough for players to understand its context.
1. Click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Videos">

While you can't directly upload videos to Roblox, you can link to videos you own on YouTube.

### Ordering

If you [upload](#uploading) multiple thumbnails, the experience's main page cycles through them automatically. To change the order of the thumbnail cycle from the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Click and hold a thumbnail's "order" icon and drag it up or down. The other thumbnails move according to the dragged thumbnail's new position.

### Deleting

To delete an [uploaded](#uploading) thumbnail from the **Thumbnails** page:

1. Click the **Delete** button to confirm the action and delete the thumbnail from the queue on the experience's main page.

## Best Practices

To create the most positive impact for users looking to play your experience, consider the following best practices.

<Alert severity="warning">
In addition to the practices shown below, avoid placing any essential text or elements at the **bottom** of the thumbnail, as it may potentially be covered by metadata like the player count.
</Alert>

### Quality and Aspect Ratio

A thumbnail image should be **16:9** aspect ratio and ideally **1920×1080 pixels** so that it always displays in high resolution across the Roblox site and app. Displayed thumbnails will be stretched to 16:9 aspect ratio regardless of the upload's aspect ratio.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-High-Res.jpg" alt="High quality and sharp thumbnail" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="success">High quality and sharp; upload in 16:9 aspect ratio</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Not-16-9.jpg" alt="Non-16:9 thumbnail" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="error">Upload not in 16:9 aspect ratio; displayed thumbnail stretched</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

### Relevant Content

A thumbnail will have a higher impact if it's unique and provides relevant imagery on what users should expect when they join the experience. Thumbnails with ambiguous imagery or graphics may lead to unnecessary confusion.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Urban-Rush.jpg" alt="Thumbnail portraying a high-action urban racing experience" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="success">Thumbnail portrays a high‑action urban racing experience</Alert>
    </figcaption>

    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Unclear.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with unclear imagery and an ambiguous graphic in the top-right corner" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="error">Unclear imagery and ambiguous graphic in top‑right corner</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

### Theme and Color

You can express your experience's theme through overall theme and colors to help users decide if it's suitable and appealing to them.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Theme-Comical.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with a comical theme/character and bright colors" />
    <figcaption>Comical theme/character with bright colors</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Theme-Horror.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with a dark and stormy theme for a horror experience" />
    <figcaption>Dark and stormy theme for a horror experience</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

## Capturing Thumbnails in Free Camera Mode

Free camera mode is a useful tool to capture in-experience screenshots and videos because it allows you to move the camera to positions that aren't possible when testing or playing under normal circumstances. To enable free camera mode:

1. Navigate to an experience where you have server-side developer console access.

2. In the **Home** tab of the menu bar, navigate to the **Test** section and click **Play**.

3. Press <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd>.

Once in free camera mode, you can use the following controls:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Keys/Shortcuts</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera forward/left/back/right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera down/up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    <td>In combination with any movement key, changes the camera speed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Right Mouse Button**</td>
    <td>When pressed, dragging the mouse moves the camera view around.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mouse Scroll Wheel**</td>
    <td>Zooms the camera in or out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>&nbsp;(Windows)<br /><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>G</kbd> (Mac)</td>
    <td>Disables all `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis` but not user-created GUIs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>&nbsp;(Windows)<br /><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> (Mac)</td>
    <td>Disables all user-created GUIs but not  `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis`.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
