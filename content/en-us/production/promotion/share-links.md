description: How to create and use share links to promote your experiences and track acquisition metrics.
---

Share links are unique and trackable links that generate metrics that allow you to track and grow your off-platform user acquisition. You can also use custom `Class.Player:GetJoinData()|LaunchData` to provide in-experience perks to users that join through your share link.

The analytics available for share links include metrics like how many new users have arrived at the experience details page through a share link, and which off-platform channel has brought in the most engaged users. There is no limit to how many share links you can create per experience; creating different links for different channels can help you keep better track of acquisition metrics.

For more information on the analytics for share links, see the [Acquisition](../analytics/acquisition.md) page.

## Create a share link
