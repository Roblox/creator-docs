title: Audience Engagement
description: Explains how to engage with your audience by announcing updates, sending notifications, or promoting your experience on social media.
---

You can engage with your audience on Roblox by [announcing updates](#announcing-updates) and by sending [Experience Notifications](#experience-notifications), or you can direct users to follow you on social media by embedding [social media links](#linking-to-social-media) on your experience's page. You can also attract a fanbase by posting frequent progress updates with interesting details on social media. It is recommended to use the **#RobloxDev** hashtag to highlight your posts to users actively interested in
development on Roblox.

## Notifications

Users can enable **notifications** for your experience by clicking the **Notifications** button on your experience's details page. For users **under** the age of 13, this means they can receive [Experience Updates](#announcing-updates). For **13+** users, this means they can receive both [Experience Updates](#announcing-updates) and [Experience Notifications](#experience-notifications).

### Announcing Updates

When you announce an update, [opted-in](#notifications) users receive a notification in their Roblox notifications stream, along with a link to launch the experience directly from the notification. Updates have a limit of 60 characters and you can only announce an update once every three days. When drafting your update, consider the following best practices:

- Focus on announcing new, exciting, and accessible information, such
  as new areas, skills, and achievements.
- Be descriptive in your updates. Updates like "bug fixes" are vague
  and don't inform the reader of what was actually fixed.
- Avoid overwhelming users with too many updates in a short time
  period.

To announce an update:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
1. Click on the thumbnail of the experience you want to associate with the user advertisement. The experience's **Overview** page displays.
1. In the left-hand navigation, under **Engagement**, click the **Updates** link.

1. In the input field, describe what has been updated in your experience, then click the **Preview** button to see how the update will display for desktop, tablet, and phone users.
1. When ready, click the **Send** button. The update is sent to everyone who enabled notifications for your experience and it immediately displays in the **History** section of your **Updates** page with the sent date, the update message, and statistics related to the update's performance.
