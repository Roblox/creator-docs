Sponsor items to increase the discoverability of your 3D user-generated content to users within the [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog). You can choose your audience, schedule the duration of your ad, and specify your budget per day. Sponsored item ads cycles can run anywhere from 24 hours to 28 days.

## Bidding system

Advertisement space works on a bidding system where the higher you set your **Daily Budget** amount in relation to other creators' bids, the more likely your sponsored item will display within the **Sponsored** category on any item's details page on the Roblox website or in the Roblox app. The location of each sponsored item within the category is random.

For example, if there are three sponsored items in the bidding system, advertising space is split according to how much each user has bid:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>User</th>
    <th>Bid amount</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>50 Robux</td>
    <td>&mdash;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>100 Robux</td>
    <td>User B's sponsored item will display **twice** as often as User A's.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>300 Robux</td>
    <td>User C's sponsored item will display **six times** as often as User A's, and **three times** as often as User B's.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Create sponsored items

Once you have at least **10 Robux** to bid on advertising space per day, you can create a new sponsored item for a specific audience, including gender, age, and platform.

To create a new sponsored item:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
1. In left-hand navigation, under **Ads**, select **Sponsored Items**.
1. In the horizontal navigation, select **Items**. All filters update.
1. In the top-right corner, click the **Create Sponsored Ad** button. The **Sponsor This Item** page displays.
1. Click the **Select Item** dropdown menu, then select the item you want to sponsor. The **Icon** section displays the current version of your item's icon.
1. In the **Target Audience**, **Schedule**, and **Daily Budget** sections, choose who can see your sponsored item, how long you want to sponsor your item, and the amount of Robux you want to spend per day.
1. In the **Ad Name** section, enter a descriptive name for your sponsored item. This is only visible to you.
1. Click the **Preview Your Ad** button. A new page with a preview of your sponsored item and a sponsorship summary display.

Roblox holds the full amount for your ad cycle as soon as you click the Run button. If you cancel the ad cycle, you will receive a refund for any amount per full day left of the ad cycle.
