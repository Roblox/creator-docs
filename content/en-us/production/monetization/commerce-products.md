- Not require any additional steps to acquire after the payment for the bundle is complete.

## Import catalog items

In the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/), you can connect your Roblox account to your Shopify store and link catalog items to your experience. You must add individual products you intend to import into Roblox.

### Import catalog items from Shopify

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
At this time, due to the link between the Shopify store and a Roblox account, Roblox group ownership transfer is not allowed for a group that owns any commerce items.
</Alert>

1. Navigate to your experience in the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/) and select **Monetization Products** > **Commerce**.
2. Click **Go to Imported Catalog** > **Start Importing**.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. Install the Roblox sales channel onto your store.
5. Connect your Roblox account. Click **Next**.
   1. After connecting your Roblox account, you can optionally connect a Roblox group to grant all group members access to your imported catalog items. This can be updated at any time under **Account** in the Roblox sales channel.
6. Click **Add Products** and select the items you will import to Roblox.
7. Click **Finish** and wait for the items to sync to Roblox. You can view your imported catalog items in the Imported Catalog tab of the Commerce page.

### Remove catalog items

In the Commerce page, you can remove any catalog item you have imported in the Catalog tab by clicking the **Delete** or **Remove** button next to the item.

When you delete an item, all commerce products that contain the item will automatically be deleted. To sell the commerce product again, you must re-import the item and recreate the product.

### Modify catalog items

When you change the price of a catalog item on Shopify, all associated commerce product bundles will be taken off sale and resubmitted for bundling fee processing.

When you update the content of your Shopify item, such as the name, description, or display image, all associated products will not be taken off sale, but they will be resubmitted for moderation. The product listing on Roblox for each product will continue to show the previously approved content until the new content is approved by moderation. See [Product detail page](#product-detail-page) for more information on how these Shopify attributes are displayed and managed.

## Manage commerce products

After importing a catalog item to your experience's Commerce page, you can begin creating commerce products.

### Create

Once you have imported catalog items, you can create commerce products. A commerce product can be either a catalog item on its own, or a catalog item bundled with a digital benefit.

You can create a maximum of 500 products per experience.

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
You cannot create an avatar item type digital benefit while creating the commerce product. Create the avatar item first before adding it to a commerce product bundle.
</Alert>

To create a commerce product:

1.  Navigate to your experience in the Creator Dashboard and select **Monetization Products** > **Commerce**.
2.  Click **Start Creating** or **Create Products**.
3.  Select which imported catalog items you want to include in your commerce products and click **Next**.
    1. If you do not see a **Next** button, your experience is not eligible to create bundles with digital benefits. Skip to step 4.
    2. At this point, your commerce products are saved as drafts. If you leave this page and want to return to them, you can find draft commerce products under **Drafts** in the **Creations** tab.

  <BaseAccordion>
  <AccordionSummary>(Optional) Bundling digital benefits </AccordionSummary>

        3. **Pre Order**: The commerce item is for pre order.

  </AccordionDetails>
  </BaseAccordion>
4. Double-check the details of your products and click **Preview** to preview the product listing for each product. For details on what this page contains and how it's populated, see [Customizing the Product Detail Page](#customizing-the-product-detail-page). Click **Submit for review**.
5. The status of your newly created commerce products is **Pending** as the product awaits moderation and potential bundling fee processing. You can hover over the information icon to see which tasks are pending.
   1. **Moderation**
       1. If your commerce product is found to violate Roblox community standards, you will see the **Status** of the commerce product change to **Moderated**.
       2. Hover over the information icon and click **View Violation** to view the violation and submit an appeal, or create a new commerce product that abides by the Roblox community standards. You must be the user whose account is connected to the Shopify store, or the group owner for group-owned stores to view the violation.
   2. **Bundling Fee** (if applicable)
       1. Once a bundling fee is available for a bundled commerce product, navigate to the commerce product to view it under **Bundling Fee**.
       2. To accept, select the product and click **Accept Bundling Fee**, or click the three dots by the bundling fee and click **Accept**.
6. Once these tasks are approved for your commerce product, the commerce product **Status** becomes **Approved** and it is ready to be integrated into your experience using `Class.CommerceService`.

### Get IDs

You will need the product ID of a commerce product to sell it in your experience.

To get the Product ID:

1. Hover over the **Product ID**.
2. Click **Copy ID** to copy it to your clipboard.

   <img src="../../assets/monetization/commerce-products/Commerce-Product-ID.png" width="60%" />

### Put on sale

Commerce products must be available for sale to be purchased in-experience.

Two identical catalog items cannot be on sale at once. You must take a bundle containing a catalog item off sale to put another one with that same item on sale. A maximum of 100 products can be for sale at a time per experience.

To change a product's sale state:

1. In the commerce page, navigate to the product you intend to sell.
2. Click **Put on Sale** or **Take Off Sale** for the product.

   <img src="../../assets/monetization/commerce-products/Commerce-Product-Put-On-Sale.png" width="30%" />

### Delete

To delete a commerce product:

1. Hover over the product.
2. Click **Delete** to delete the product.

## Implement purchases

In your experience, implement commerce product purchases using the following `Class.CommerceService` functions:

- `Class.CommerceService:PromptCommerceProductPurchase()`: Prompts a specific user to purchase a commerce product using the provided commerceProductId. It will open a webview that guides the user through the purchasing flow.
- `Class.CommerceService:PromptCommerceProductPurchaseFinished()`: Use this signal to detect when a user has completed the purchasing flow and the webview has closed to resume gameplay within the experience.
  - This signal does not indicate a successful purchase and only signifies when the prompt is closed.
  - While optional, it is recommended to use this signal to reorient your users on Android, as the commerce purchasing flow will have forced them into portrait mode.

### Grant digital benefits

<Alert severity = 'info'>
[Eligible creators](#eligibility) can add a digital benefit to their commerce products.
</Alert>

When [creating a commerce product](#create), you have the option to bundle the catalog item with a digital benefit.

#### Avatar items

If an avatar item is bundled with a commerce item, Roblox automatically grants the linked avatar item after a user successfully purchases a commerce product.

If Roblox detects a cancellation or refund of the physical item, Roblox automatically revokes the avatar item from the account.

If the avatar item is moderated, the status of any commerce product linked to the item will become moderated and it will be taken off sale. After 7 days, Roblox will automatically revoke the avatar item from all accounts that purchased these products. Upon a successful appeal, the avatar item will be regranted.

#### Developer products

After a user successfully purchases a commerce product, Roblox generates a developer product receipt and sends it to the server where the user is present. Follow the existing `Class.MarketplaceService.ProcessReceipt` flow for handling developer product granting.

In the event of a refund or cancellation of the physical item, you may want to revoke associated in-game items or benefits. Roblox does not automatically revoke developer products that were granted to users as a digital benefit.

Roblox provides webhook integration for commerce events. When an order is paid, canceled, or refunded, Roblox will send a webhook message with the latest order status and order details. Developers can use this information to revoke in-game items or benefits as needed.

For more information on webhook notifications, see the [documentation](../../cloud/webhooks/webhook-notifications.md#commerce).

Use `CommerceProductOrderPaid` and `CommerceProductOrderRefunded` events to track the status of the product order. The EventPayload will contain the relevant `CommerceProductOrder` which has the following schema:

```lua title="EventPayload schema"

## Product detail page

The **Product detail page (PDP)** showcases your commerce product to users within the Roblox experience, for example, when prompted via [`Class.CommerceService:PromptCommerceProductPurchase()`](#implement-purchases). You can customize several elements of this page to provide a unique and informative shopping experience.

<Alert severity = 'info'>
When viewing the product detail page for a product that is not yet on sale, a "Preview Mode" banner is displayed at the top (as seen in the example PDP image). Only creators with sufficient permissions in the experience can see this preview.

### Product images

The product images section displays all product images from your Shopify store. The order of the images directly mirrors the order set in Shopify.

The first image, known as the **featured** image in Shopify, serves as the primary thumbnail for your product. This thumbnail is used in various places, such as within the shopping cart and in the [More from](#more-from-this-experience) section.

When you update product images in Shopify, these changes are subject to the [moderation process for catalog items](#modify-catalog-items). The product listing on Roblox will continue to show the previously approved images until the new images are approved.

### Product title, price, and seller information

The product title is taken directly from the product title set in the Shopify store.

The displayed price dynamically updates if the user selects differently priced product [variants and quantity](#variants-and-quantity). The seller information displayed is your Shopify store name.

Similar to other product attributes, if you update the product title in Shopify, these changes are subject to the [moderation process for catalog items](#modify-catalog-items). The product listing on Roblox will continue to show the previously approved title until the new title is approved.

### Variants and quantity

Product variants and their options, such as different colors or sizes, are synchronized from your Shopify store. The order in which these variants and options appear matches the order in Shopify, displayed from top to bottom.

When a user selects a specific variant, the main product image updates to display the image associated with that particular variant in Shopify.

At this time, the quantity selector on the PDP does not offer customization options. If the selected product variant is not available, the "Buy now" and "Add to cart" buttons are disabled. Ensure your variants are correctly configured in Shopify to allow purchases.

Any updates made to product variants or their images in Shopify are subject to the [moderation process for catalog items](#modify-catalog-items). The product detail page will continue to display the previously approved variant information and images until the new versions are approved.

### Product details

The **Product details** section displays the content directly from your Shopify product description.

This section supports the use of HTML for styling and formatting your product information. For security and consistency, Roblox automatically removes certain HTML elements, including links, images, scripts, and other similar tags and attributes. You can otherwise use HTML to style and structure the text content, such as using headings, bold text, lists, and paragraphs.

As with other product information synced from Shopify, any updates to the product description are subject to the [moderation process for catalog items](#modify-catalog-items). The product details will continue to show the previously approved description until the new content is approved by moderation.

### Additional information

The **Additional information** section displays supplementary details about your product using collapsible accordions. You can add **up to five** accordion sections for different topics, such as "Materials," "Care Instructions," or "Sizing".

This is an optional feature and is populated using Shopify product metafields. To create a metafield accordion in Shopify:

- Define a product metafield in your Shopify store with a specific namespace: `Roblox.pdp_info_`.
  - You can append a unique identifier to this namespace, such as `Roblox.pdp_info_materials` or `Roblox.pdp_info_care_instructions`.
- Set the following fields:

  - **Name** — The value in this field displays as the header for that accordion.
  - **Type** — Only "Multi-line text" is supported.

     <img src="../../assets/monetization/commerce-products/Commerce-Product-Metafield-Example.png" width="60%" />

- Then set the **Value** of the metafield for each desired product. This value displays as the content for that accordion.

Like other product content synced from Shopify, any new or updated information in these metafields is subject to the [moderation process for catalog items](#modify-catalog-items). This page will display previously approved content until the new information is approved.

### Virtual benefit with purchase

If you have bundled a [digital benefit](#digital-benefits) to your product, this section showcases the virtual item that users receive with their purchase. This section provides a clear visual and informational cue to users about the added digital value they receive, enhancing the appeal of your commerce product.

The content in this section depends on the type of virtual item offered:

- Avatar item

  - This section displays the thumbnail and name of the avatar item.
  - Users can click on this section to view a 3D preview of the avatar item.
  - The description of the avatar item displays when the user clicks into this section.

- Developer product
  - This section displays the image and name of the developer product.
  - The description of the developer product displays when the user clicks into this section.

The specific avatar item or developer product, including its name, description, and image, is configured when you [create the commerce product bundle](#create). As these benefits are part of the overall product offering, they are subject to Roblox's content policies and moderation.

### More from this experience

This section displays other commerce products you offer that are currently on-sale within the same Roblox experience. This feed encourages further exploration of your product catalog and can help increase visibility for your experience's full range of product offerings.

In this section, users can view the product's feature image, name, and price.
