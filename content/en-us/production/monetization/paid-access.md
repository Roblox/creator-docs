<Alert severity="error">
Paid access for experiences is currently only available in Robux. [Fiat currency (real-world money) will become available in late 2024.](#paid-access-in-fiat-currency)
</Alert>

**Paid access** lets you charge users a one-time Robux fee to access an experience. Your Robux earnings from paid access purchases go into escrow for up to 7 days before they're paid out.

Users who purchase access continue to have access to the experience even if you increase the price or disable paid access.

<Alert severity="info">
Paid access limits the number of users who will access your experience because some users don't want to pay a fee.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="info">
Some developers temporarily enable paid access to create a closed beta so that their most engaged users can have early access to an experience to help with testing and feedback. If you choose to do this, make sure to let users know that they're purchasing a beta version of your experience.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Experiences with paid access are not available on Xbox.

## Enabling Paid Access in Robux

Before you can enable paid access, your account must be at least 30 days old and your experience must be public to all users.

You can enable paid access in Robux in Roblox Studio or in the Creator Dashboard.

### In Roblox Studio

To enable paid access in Roblox Studio:

1. Go to [Home](../../studio/home-tab.md) > [Game Settings](../../studio/game-settings.md).

2. Click **Monetization**.
3. Enable the **Paid Access** toggle.
4. In the **Price** field, enter the amount of Robux you want users to pay to access your experience. The price you enter affects the amount of Robux you earn per sale.
5. Click **Save**.

### In the Creator Dashboard

To enable paid access in the Creator Dashboard:

1. Go to [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) and select an experience.
2. Go to **Audience** > **Access Settings**.
3. Enable the **Requires Robux** toggle.
4. In the **Robux Price** field, enter the amount of Robux you want users to pay to access your experience. The price you enter affects the amount of Robux you earn per sale.
5. Click **Save Changes**.

## Limitations

To support paid access, an experience must:

- Follow the [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).
- Have been created by an account that's at least 30 days old.
- Be public and available to all users.
- Not have [private servers](../monetization/private-servers.md).
- Not earn [engagement-based payouts](./engagement-based-payouts.md).
- Not allow users to download copies of any places within the experience. Copying an experience is automatically disabled when you enable paid access.
- Run properly and be playable. If a large number of users reports that an experience is broken, the experience might be quarantined and earnings still in escrow refunded to users.

## Paid Access in Fiat Currency

<Alert severity="error">
Paid access in fiat currency will be available in late 2024. We'll share more closer to launch.
</Alert>

Paid access in fiat currency lets you charge real-world money for your paid access experience. Users can purchase the experience on desktop in their local currency, or in USD if their local currency isn't available.

When you charge for paid access in fiat currency on desktop, you earn a percentage of the price you set, called a **developer revenue share**. For example, if you set the price to $49.99 USD, you receive 70% of the proceeds, minus certain fees like taxes and VAT.

The revenue share is expected to follow three tiers:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Desktop Price<sup>1</sup></th>
    <th>Developer Share</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>$9.99</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$29.99</td>
    <td>60%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$49.99</td>
    <td>70%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<sup>1. Purchased on desktop, in real currency.</sup>
