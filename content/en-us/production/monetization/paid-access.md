title: Paid Access
description: Paid Access lets you charge a one-time Robux fee in order for users to access your experience.
---

**Paid Access** allows you to charge a **one-time fee** of 25â€“1000 Robux in order for users to access an experience. Once a user pays this fee, they'll continue to have access to that experience even if you increase the price or disable Paid Access. Your Robux earnings from Paid Access purchases go into escrow for up to 7 days before being paid out.

<Alert severity="warning">
This feature limits the number of users that will access your experience, as some users won't want to pay the fee. Some developers [temporarily enable Paid Access](#enabling-paid-access) to create a closed beta so their most engaged users can have early access to an experience to help with testing and feedback.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Paid access experiences are not available on Xbox.

## Enabling Paid Access

Before you can enable paid access, your account must be at least 30 days old and your experience must be **public** to all users.

To enable paid access:

1. Open [Game Settings](../../studio/game-settings.md) from the [Home](../../studio/home-tab.md) tab.

1. In the left-hand navigation, click **Monetization**.
1. Enable the **Paid Access** toggle and, in the **Price** field, enter the amount of Robux you want users to pay to access your experience. The price you enter affects the amount of Robux you earn per sale.
1. Click the **Save** button.

## Restrictions

Your account must be at least 30 days old to [enable paid access](#enabling-paid-access) for an experience. However, such experiences **cannot**:

- Break any of the [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410) or [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).
- Be available only to friends or group members (the experience must be available to everyone).
- Support [private servers](../monetization/private-servers.md).
- Earn [engagement-based payouts](./engagement-based-payouts.md). However, you can still review the experience's payout score.
- Allow users to download a copy of any place within the experience. When you enable Paid Access, your experience will automatically disallow copying.
- Be broken or otherwise unplayable. If so, and a larger number of users submit complaints, the experience will be quarantined. You will have the opportunity to fix any issues, but earnings still in escrow at the time of quarantine will be refunded to buyers.
