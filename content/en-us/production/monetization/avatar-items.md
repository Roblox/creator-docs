description: Sell community created Avatar items exclusively through your experience.
---

**Avatar items** are 3D assets, such as accessories and clothing, that Roblox avatars can equip and wear. While many avatar items are sold on the Roblox's Marketplace, you can work with item creators to sell avatar items exclusively in your experience.

By selling unique avatar items in your experience, you can create experience-specific cosmetics while still taking advantage of Roblox's [commission payouts](../../art/marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md#commissions) for avatar assets sold within an experience.

For information on how to create and sell your own avatar items, which requires third-party software such as Blender or Maya, see Roblox's [Avatar](../../avatar/index.md) documentation.

## Enabling In-Experience Sales

To set an avatar item on sale, the item creator and the experience owner must perform the following:

1. The **item creator** must [add the experience's Place ID](#adding-place-id) to their item's sale location data.
2. The **experience owner** must [add the avatar item's Asset ID](#adding-items-to-experience) and enable the item.
   1. If the experience owner and the item creator are the same person, Roblox automatically adds and enables the asset to the experience after setting the sale location.

### Adding Place ID

Before enabling an avatar item sale in your experience, the creator of the item must add the experience's starting place ID to the avatar item's sales location.

1. Open the [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard**.
2. Click the **&ctdot;** in the corner of the experience's thumbnail and select **Copy Start Place ID**.

3. As the item creator, [update your item's marketplace settings](../../art/marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md#marketplace-settings) and add the Place ID to the item's Sale Location field.

### Adding Items to Experience

After the item creator adds your experience to the asset's sale location, you can now enable the item for the experience.

To search and enable an asset for sale:

1. Navigate to your [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard** and select your experience.
2. In the **Monetization** menu, select **Avatar Items**. All avatar items for that experience display.

3. Using the search bar, use the item's Asset ID to find the avatar item.
   1. If you do not see the item populate, verify that your Asset ID is correct and that the item creator has added the correct Place ID to the item's sales locations.
4. Using the dropdown on the thumbnail, click **Enable Sale**.
