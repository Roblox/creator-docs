title: Paid access in Robux
description: Paid access lets you charge users a one-time fee in Robux to access your experience.
---

**Paid access** lets you charge users a one-time fee in Robux to access an experience on desktop, mobile, VR, and most gaming consoles. Users who purchase access continue to have access to the experience even if you increase the price or disable paid access.

<Alert severity="info">
Paid access can limit the number of users who join your experience, as some users might not want to pay a fee for access.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="info">
Some developers temporarily enable paid access to create a closed beta so that their most engaged users can have early access to an experience to help with testing and feedback. If you choose to do this, make sure to let users know that they're purchasing a beta version of your experience.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Experiences with paid access are not available on Xbox.
