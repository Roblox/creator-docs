title: Paid Access in Local Currency
description: Paid access lets you charge users a one-time fee in their local currency to access your experience.
---

**Paid access** lets you charge users a one-time fee in their local currency to access an experience. If their local currency isn't available, they're charged in USD. Users who purchase access continue to have access to the experience even if you increase the price later or disable paid access.

<Alert severity="info">
Paid access can limit the number of users who join your experience, as some users might not want to pay a fee for access.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="info">
Some developers temporarily enable paid access to create a closed beta so that their most engaged users can have early access to an experience to help with testing and feedback. If you choose to do this, make sure to let users know that they're purchasing a beta version of your experience.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Users can only purchase paid access in local currency on desktop and on web, but they can play their purchased experiences on any of the devices you [enable in the Creator Hub](#enabling-paid-access-in-the-creator-hub).
</Alert>

## Pricing

When you charge for paid access in local currency, you earn a percentage of the price you set, called a **developer revenue share**. For example, if you set the price to $49.99 USD, you receive 70% of the proceeds, minus certain fees like taxes and VAT.

The revenue share follows three price points:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Computer & web price<sup>1</sup></th>
    <th>Developer share</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>$9.99</td>
    <td>50%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$29.99</td>
    <td>60%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$49.99</td>
    <td>70%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<sup>1. Purchased on desktop in local currency.</sup>
<br/>

You can change your revenue share price point, switch to paid access in Robux, or make your experience free to play any time using the Creator Hub.

## Refunds

Users have 48 hours to request a refund after purchasing a paid access experience in their local currency. After they receive their refund, they no longer have access to the paid experience.

Refunds aren't available after 48 hours.

## Setting Up Your Account to Receive Payouts

You must set up a Tipalti account to receive payouts for purchases of paid access in local currency. To set up a Tipalti account:

1. In the Creator Hub, go to **Creations** and select an experience.
2. Go to **Audience** > **Access Settings**.
3. Under **Payment**, select **Send Request**.
4. Enter your legal first and last name.

Within 5 to 8 business days of submitting your payment information, Tipalti sends you an email with instructions on how to create an account and submit your tax and banking information. Tipalti then verifies your documents and confirms your account has been successfully set up.

Local currency earnings from paid access purchases are held in escrow for a minimum of 60 days, and paid out and deposited into your account once a month. You can't access your earnings outside of the payout schedule.

<Alert severity="info">
For experiences owned by groups, the group owner must be the one to set up a Tipalti account. Only group owners can receive payouts.

## Policies

Paid access experiences in local currency must:

- Follow the [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).
- Be public and available to all users.
- Provide buyers with access to the entire experience.
- Not give buyers access to content or items from other experiences.
- Not have [private servers](../monetization/private-servers.md).
- Not be spam, contain scams, repeat existing experiences, or be an empty experience.
- Not require users to pay Robux to access additional parts of the experience. Users must be able to access the entire experience they have purchased. Microtransactions for items inside the experience, like passes or developer products, are allowed.
- Not allow users to download copies of any places within the experience. Copying an experience is automatically disabled when you enable paid access.
- Run properly and be playable. If a large number of users reports that an experience is broken, the experience might be quarantined and earnings still in escrow refunded to users.

Violating these policies can result in loss of access to the paid access feature, removal of content, or suspension of your Roblox account.
