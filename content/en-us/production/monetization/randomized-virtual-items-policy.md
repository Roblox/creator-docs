title: Randomized virtual items policy
description: Explains Roblox's policy for selling randomized virtual items.
---

Under Roblox's [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use), if you offer randomized virtual items that users can purchase with Robux or other in-experience currency, you must indicate all the **actual numerical odds** of what they may receive. For example, if a user has the opportunity to purchase a magic charm that has the random chance to either have a rare, epic, or legendary status, you must disclose the odds of their potential award **before they spend Robux**:

This policy also applies to indirect purchases. For example, if a user uses their Robux to purchase a seed, then later plants the seed in exchange for a randomized virtual item, you must disclose the odds of their potential award **before they plant the seed.**

<Alert severity="info">
  If your experience offers randomized virtual rewards in exchange for completing an action that does <strong>not</strong> involve the payment of Robux or other in-experience currency, you aren't required to disclose the odds. For example, if a user locates a key that opens a treasure chest, you don't need to state the odds of what items they might receive from the treasure chest.
