A **private server** is a subscription-based feature that allows a user to decide who can play an experience with them. While private servers can be free, you can also use private servers as a method of monetization by charging users who want to access private servers a **monthly Robux fee**.

Private servers offer users privacy in circumstances like:

- Playing experiences with their connections.
- Holding gatherings such as classes, meetings, or parties.
- Recording and/or streaming without other users.
- Gathering in-experience resources.

<Alert severity="warning">
You cannot enable [paid access in Robux](../monetization/paid-access-robux.md) or [paid access in local currency](../monetization/paid-access-local-currency.md) and private servers at the same time.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
Players under the age of 13 may not be able to join private servers depending on their privacy and parental control settings.
</Alert>

## Enable private servers

Before you can enable private servers, your experience must be **public** to all users.

To create a private server:

1. Open Studio's **File** ⟩ **Experience Settings** window.
1. In the left-hand navigation, click **Monetization**.
1. Enable the **Private Servers** toggle. Additional settings appear for setting how to monetize private servers:

   - **Free** &mdash; Click the **Free** radio button to make private servers free to all.
   - **Paid** &mdash; Click the **Paid** radio button, then enter the amount of Robux you want users to pay to access the private server. The price you enter affects the amount of Robux you earn per sale.

1. Click the **Save** button.

<Alert severity="warning">
Note that changing the price of private servers **cancels all active subscriptions**. Users who had active subscriptions automatically receive a private message in their inbox about this change.
