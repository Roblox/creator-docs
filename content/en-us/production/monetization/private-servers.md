A **private server** is a subscription-based feature that allows a user to decide who can play an experience with them. While private servers can be free, you can also use private servers as a method of monetization by charging users who want to access private servers a **monthly Robux fee**.

Private servers offer users privacy in circumstances like:

- Playing experiences with their friends.

- Holding gatherings such as classes, meetings, or parties.

- Recording and/or streaming without other users.

- Gathering in-experience resources.

## Creating Private Servers

Before you can create private servers, your experience must be public to all users.

To create a private server:

1. In the **Home** tab of the menu bar, navigate to the **Settings** section and click **Game Settings**. The **Game Settings** menu displays.

2. In the left-hand navigation of the **Game Settings** window, click **Monetization**.

3. Enable the **Private Servers** toggle. Additional private server settings display:

   - If you want the servers to be free, select the **Free** radio button.

   - If you want to monetize the private servers, select the **Paid** radio button, then enter the amount of Robux you want a user to pay to access the private server. The price you enter affects the amount of Robux you earn per sale.
