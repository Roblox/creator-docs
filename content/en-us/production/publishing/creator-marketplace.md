The **Creator Marketplace** is where you can find all assets that are made by Roblox and the Roblox community for the Roblox community to use within their experiences, such as models, images, meshes, audio, fonts, videos, and plugins.

You can create and publish models, images, meshes, and plugins to the Creator Marketplace for others to use as long as you are the original creator, and it adheres to Roblox's [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).

<Alert severity="warning">
To maintain community safety, Roblox may terminate accounts that publish spam or assets with malicious or obfuscated code.

### Community Ratings

In addition to the Creator Marketplace's filters, you can view an asset's community approval when you hover over its tile. There are four asset community ratings:

- **Gray** - The asset has minimal data for the Creator Marketplace to determine community confidence.
- **Red** - The asset has low community confidence.
- **Yellow** - The asset has moderate community confidence.
- **Green** - The asset has high community confidence.

### Trusted Reviews

Users can now leave reviews on Creator Marketplace assets in addition to the currently available thumbs up or down ratings. To improve reliability and ensure authentic feedback, only users that acquire the asset are able to submit reviews. After submitting a review:

- Asset creators can respond to reviews, closing the feedback loop.
- The community can mark reviews as helpful for future users.

## Adding Assets to Experiences

To add assets to your experience from the Creator Marketplace:

1. Find the asset you want to add to your experience.

2. Either click the asset or drag-and-drop it from the Toolbox into the viewport.

   - If your asset is a model or mesh, it displays both in the viewport and the **Explorer** window.
   - If your asset is an image, video, or audio file, it displays in the **Explorer** window.
   - If your asset is a plugin, it displays in the **Plugins** tab of the menu bar.
   - If your asset is a font, it displays in your font library within user interface elements, such as [labels](../../ui/labels.md) or [buttons](../../ui/buttons.md), as well as the **Inventory** tab of the [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md).

### Disabling Scripts

Some assets include scripts that allow the asset to perform specific actions, such as animating at runtime or triggering a sound when a user interacts with the asset. However, if you want to add an asset to your experience without allowing any of its scripts to trigger, you can disable the scripts within the asset.

To disable scripts:

1. In the **Explorer** window, right-click on the asset with scripts you want to disable. A contextual menu displays.

2. Select **Disable Scripts**.

## Publishing Assets

[Publishing assets](../../production/publishing/publishing-assets.md) to the Creator Marketplace is the only way to make your assets publicly available to all users to use within their own experiences in Studio. You can publish any mesh or image that you have imported through the [Asset Manager](../../projects/assets/manager.md), or any [model](../../parts/models.md) or [plugin](../../studio/plugins.md) that you have uploaded to your inventory.

There are limits on the number of assets you can publish per 30 days. If you **verify your account**, you can publish 200 mesh assets, 200 image assets, 200 model assets, and 10 plugins; if you're unverified, you can publish 10 mesh assets, 10 image assets, 10 model assets, and 2 plugins.

## Verifying Your Account

In addition to being able to publish more of each asset type, verifying your account ensures that your assets are visible to creators, as the default option for discoverability for assets on the Creator Marketplace is reserved for verified accounts. In order to verify your account, you must:

- Be at least 13 years of age.
- Have a government-issued photo ID with your picture on it, such as a driver's license, passport, or residency permit.
- Have a mobile device with a camera that can take photos of your face and ID.

For information on how to verify your account either through a government-issued ID or through a phone number, see [Account Verification](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md).
