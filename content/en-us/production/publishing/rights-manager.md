**Rights Manager** is an intellectual property (IP) management tool that lets rights holders or their authorized representatives report unauthorized use of their content on Roblox. All rights holders, including those that don't have a presence on Roblox, can use this tool to request the removal of unauthorized experiences, avatar items, and assets hosted on the platform.

Before using the Rights Manager, you must [register as an IP holder](../../ip-licensing/get-started.md#register-as-an-ip-holder) and [verify ownership of your IP](../../ip-licensing/get-started.md#verify-ip-ownership).

## File an IP removal request

Once Roblox accepts your registration as an IP holder, you can create IP removal requests for assets, experiences, and avatar items to protect your intellectual property.

To file a removal request:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **Removal Requests**.
2. In the **Removal Requests** tab, click **New Removal Request**.
3. Fill out the removal request form.
   1. Under **Select creations for removal**:
      1. Provide a link to your creation on the Roblox platform.
      2. Provide up to 250 links to the creations you are reporting.
      3. (Optional) Enter any additional details that might be relevant and that might help Roblox understand your report. For example, if you are reporting an asset in an experience, provide a screenshot and details of where to find the asset you are reporting.
      4. Click **Add Creation**.
   2. Under **Review creations**, review the details of your removal request and click **Next**.
   3. Under **Add details**:
      1. Under **General**, enter a name for the removal request. This makes it easier for you to search for this specific request later.
      2. Under **Legal Agreements**, confirm that the information you provided is accurate and enter your full legal name as your signature.
      3. Click **Submit for Review**. Roblox will now review your IP removal request.

<Alert severity="info">
  After you submit a removal request, you cannot edit any information within the request while Roblox reviews its content.

## Review IP removal requests

To review removal requests, go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **Removal Requests**. Requests you filed are listed under the **Removal Requests** tab, while requests filed against you are listed under the **Claims Against Me** tab.

Removal requests can have one of three statuses:

- **Pending**: The IP removal request is still under review.
- **Approved**: Roblox approved the IP removal request and removed the infringing content.
- **Rejected**: Roblox rejected the IP removal request.

If you believe that a rejected creation is still infringing on you, your client, or your organization's copyrights, you can file a new IP removal request with additional information.
