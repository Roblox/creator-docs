The **Rights Manager** is an Intellectual Property (IP) management tool that lets rights holders or their authorized representative report unauthorized use of copyright content on Roblox. All rights holders, including those that don't have a presence on Roblox, can use this tool to request the removal of unauthorized experiences, avatar items, and assets hosted on the platform.

## Registering Ownership

In order to use the Rights Manager, you must first register either as a rights owner or their authorized representative. This allows Roblox to confirm your legal identity with the creations that you own or represent. You only need to complete this process once.

Roblox requires two forms of verification during the registration process to verify your identity:

- Government ID verification
- Email verification

Once verification is complete, Roblox discards any personal data from your documents, excluding your date of birth. Roblox uses your date of birth to ensure that the age on your account is accurate, and doesn't share it with anyone you report for IP infringement. For more information on how Roblox uses this information, see [Age ID Verification FAQs](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407276151188-Age-ID-Verification-FAQs).

To register as a rights owner or their authorized representative:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard).
1. In the left-hand navigation, select **Rights Manager**. The Rights Manager landing page displays.

1. Click the **Start Registration** button.
1. [Verify your account](account-verification.md) with your government issued ID and email address, then click the **Next** button. Each incomplete verification type includes a blue **VERIFY** button you can click to redirect you to the appropriate location to verify your ID or email.

Two additional fields display asking for your full name, and the name of your organization or client.

## Filing IP Removal Request

Once Roblox accepts your registration, you can create IP removal requests for one or more assets, experiences, and avatar items to protect your intellectual property. After you submit an IP removal request, you cannot edit any information within the request while Roblox reviews its content.

To file an IP removal request:

1. Near the top of the **Rights Manager** landing page, click the **New Removal Request** button. A new IP removal request form displays.

## Reviewing IP Removal Requests

All IP removal requests display within a table on the Rights Manager landing page, and you can review each reported creation's status as Roblox processes your report.

<img src="../../assets/publishing/rights-manager/Reviewing-IP-Removal-Requests.png" width="100%" />

A reported creation can have one of three statuses:

- **Pending** – The IP removal request is still under review.
- **Approved** – Roblox approved the IP removal request, and removed the infringing content.
- **Rejected** – Roblox rejected the IP removal request with a reason for the decision.

If you have reason to believe that a rejected creation is still infringing on you, your client, or your organization's copyrights, you can file a new IP removal request with additional information.
