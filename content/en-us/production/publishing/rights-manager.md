description: Explains how to request the removal of copyright infringing experiences, avatar items, and assets hosted on Roblox.

The **Rights Manager** is an Intellectual Property (IP) management tool that lets rights holders or their authorized representatives report unauthorized use of copyright content on Roblox. All rights holders, including those that don't have a presence on Roblox, can use this tool to request the removal of unauthorized experiences, avatar items, and assets hosted on the platform.

## Register your account

In order to use the Rights Manager, you must first register either as a rights owner or their authorized representative. This allows Roblox to confirm your legal identity with the creations that you own or represent. You only need to complete this process once.

To register as a rights holder or as an authorized representative:

1. In the Creator Hub, go to **Intellectual Property** > **Registration**.
2. Click **Start registration**.
3. Fill out the registration form.
    1. Under **Rights holder**:
        1. In the dropdown, select one of:
            - **I am the rights holder** if you're registering on behalf of yourself.
            - **I am reporting on behalf of my organization or client** if you're an authorized representative registering on behalf of someone else.
        2. Enter your full name.
        3. If you're an authorized representative, enter your organization or client name.
    2. Under **Address**, enter your address.
    3. If you're an authorized representative, under **Supporting documentation**, upload documents that prove you're an authorized representative of the rights holder. You can upload a maximum of 3 files. See [Supporting documentation](#supporting-documentation) for more information.
    4. Under **Legal agreements**, confirm that all of your information in the registration form is accurate, and agree to the [Terms of Use](https://www.roblox.com/info/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.roblox.com/info/privacy).
    5. Under **Signature**, enter your full legal name as your electronic signature.
4. Click **Submit for review**.

### Supporting documentation

If you're registering as the authorized representative of a rights holder, you must upload supporting documentation in the form of a **letter of authorization**. This letter must:

- Be on official company letterhead.
- Identify you as the individual authorized representative.
- Identify the company you work for.
- State whether you are authorized to act on the IP holder's entire IP portfolio or only on specific IP titles.
- State whether you can enforce the IP rights (for example, issue removal requests), enter into license agreements pertaining to the IP rights, or both.
- Be signed and dated. Digital signatures are allowed.

## File an IP removal request

Once Roblox accepts your registration, you can create IP removal requests for one or more assets, experiences, and avatar items to protect your intellectual property. After you submit an IP removal request, you cannot edit any information within the request while Roblox reviews its content.

To file an IP removal request:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** > **Rights Manager** > **Removal Requests**.
2. In the **Removal Requests** tab, click **New Removal Request**.
3. Fill out the removal request form.
   1. Under **Select creations for removal**:
      1. Provide a link to your creation on the Roblox platform.
      2. Provide up to 250 links to the creations you are reporting.
      3. **(Optional)** Enter any additional details that might be relevant and that might help Roblox understand your report. For example, if you are reporting an asset in an experience, provide a screenshot and details of where to find the asset you are reporting.
      4. Click **Add Creation**.
   2. Under **Review creations**, review the details of your removal request and click **Next**.
   3. Under **Add details**:
      1. Under **General**, enter a name for the removal request. You can use this name later to easily search for this specific request.
      2. Under **Legal Agreements**, confirm that the information you provided is accurate and enter your full legal name as your signature.
      3. Click **Submit for Review**. Roblox now reviews your IP removal request.

## Review IP removal requests

All IP removal requests display within a table on the Rights Manager landing page, and you can review each reported creation's status as Roblox processes your report.

A reported creation can have one of three statuses:

- **Pending**: The IP removal request is still under review.
- **Approved**: Roblox approved the IP removal request and removed the infringing content.
- **Rejected**: Roblox rejected the IP removal request with a reason for the decision.

If you believe that a rejected creation is still infringing on you, your client, or your organization's copyrights, you can file a new IP removal request with additional information.
