Thumbnails appear on Roblox's [Home](https://www.roblox.com/home) page and at the top of your experience's detail page, allowing you to showcase your experience's features and announce updates or events.

<img src="../../assets/publishing/experiences-places-assets/Experience-Page-Example.jpg" width="1120" />

To access your thumbnails:

1. In the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations), select the experience you want to upload a thumbnail for.
2. Go to **Configure** &rang; **Places** and select a place.
3. Click **Thumbnails**. Use the **Home Page** tab and the **Experience Detail Page** tab to customize your experience's thumbnails for these two spaces.

<Alert severity="info">
While thumbnails help users know what your experience offers, [icons](../publishing/experience-icons.md) are still important to help users recognize your experience and grow its brand.
</Alert>

## Thumbnail personalization for the Home page

**Thumbnail personalization** helps you attract more users to your experience by showing the most relevant thumbnail to each user on their Home page. The goal of thumbnail personalization is to improve your qualified play through rate, which is the percentage of users that actively engage with your experience for a significant amount of time.

<Alert severity="success">
During testing, experiences using thumbnail personalization had an average increase of +8.5% in their qualified play through rate. Some experiences had an increase of +50%.
</Alert>

Thumbnail personalization only starts when you activate 2 or more thumbnails. If only one of your thumbnails is active, all users see that thumbnail for your experience on their Home page.

After you set up and activate thumbnail personalization, its algorithm shows each thumbnail to a random set of users to get data on the qualified play through rate for each user group. It then gives more impressions to the winning thumbnail for each group, but still gives the other thumbnails minimal traffic to continue exploration.

### Set up thumbnail personalization

To set up thumbnail personalization:

1. In the **Home Page** tab, click **Edit active thumbnails**.
2. Upload new thumbnails or activate existing thumbnails.
   - To upload new thumbnails, click **Upload thumbnails** and select and confirm the images you want to use. Make sure to keep these images under 3MB and 1920x1080 pixels.
   - To activate existing thumbnails, enable the **Active** checkbox next to 2-5 thumbnails.
3. Click **Save changes**.
4. In the **Start new thumbnail personalization?** dialog, click **Start**. The banner in the **Home Page** tab updates to indicate that thumbnail personalization is active.

### Keep multiple thumbnails active

<Alert severity="warning">
To get the most out of thumbnail personalization, make sure to **keep multiple thumbnails active** instead of choosing one winner, as this allows personalization to adapt to changing user trends.
</Alert>

For example, if you had removed the thumbnail associated with the green line in the chart below too early, you would have missed future additional impressions for what ended up becoming your second-best performing thumbnail.

<img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Impressions-Graph.png" width="75%" alt="Example of the Impression by Thumbnail graph" />

We recommend testing multiple new thumbnails with any major experience or content update, and then not making changes to your thumbnails until your experience's next update.

### Analyze thumbnail personalization performance

After a few hours, the **Thumbnail Performance** table in the **Home Page** tab populates with statistics related to each of your active thumbnails:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Status**</td>
    <td>Indicates if the thumbnail is active for personalization.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Impressions**</td>
    <td>Number of impressions from Home page recommendations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Qualified Plays**</td>
    <td>Number of qualified plays from Home page recommendations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Average Playtime**</td>
    <td>The average session time in minutes per qualified play.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Qualified Play Through Rate**</td>
    <td>The percentage of qualified plays divided by impressions from Home page recommendations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Winning Segment**</td>
    <td>The thumbnail with the highest play through rate during the current thumbnail personalization process.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can also use the **Impressions by thumbnail** and the **Qualified play through rate by thumbnail** graphs to further analyze the performance of your personalized thumbnails over time.

## Thumbnails for the experience detail page

You can use two types of thumbnails to promote your experience on the experience's detail page:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Image**</td>
    <td>Supplements the experience [icon](../publishing/experience-icons.md) and helps users know what your experience offers. Ideally showcases in‑experience mechanics, assets, and gameplay.</td>
		<td>Free</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>**Video**</td>
    <td>Links directly to YouTube. Many creators use this type of thumbnail to display trailers.</td>
		<td>500&nbsp;Robux</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Upload

You can upload up to 10 images or YouTube video links for each of your experiences' detail pages. All uploaded images and linked videos are moderated to make sure they adhere to the [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Images">

To upload image thumbnails:

1. Go to the **Experience Detail Page** tab.
2. Click **Upload thumbnail**. From the file browser, select and confirm the image you want to use as the thumbnail. Make sure to use a template of **1920×1080 pixels** and to export the image in `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.png`, `.tga`, or `.bmp` format.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Videos">

While you can't directly upload videos to Roblox, you can link to videos you own on YouTube.

<Alert severity="warning">
Xbox doesn't currently support video thumbnails.
</Alert>

To upload video thumbnails:

1. Go to the **Experience Detail Page** tab.
2. Click **Upload video**.
3. In the **YouTube URL** field, enter the URL of the video you want to display as a video thumbnail.
4. Click **Add video**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Auto-generated">

Roblox can auto‑generate images from the experience itself to showcase your environment designs. Auto‑generated thumbnails are based on Studio's camera position for the most recent publish of the place.

To upload auto-generated thumbnails:

1. Go to the **Experience Detail Page** tab.
2. Click **Auto-generated image**. The image automatically generates and is added to you thumbnail list.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Order

If you upload multiple thumbnails, your experience's detail page cycles through all of the thumbnails automatically. To change the order of the thumbnail cycle, click and hold a thumbnail's **order** icon and drag it up or down.

### Delete

To delete an uploaded thumbnail, click the thumbnail's **menu** icon and then click **Delete**.

## Capture thumbnails in free camera mode

Free camera mode is a useful tool to capture in-experience screenshots and videos because it allows you to move the camera to positions that aren't possible when testing or playing under normal circumstances. To enable free camera mode:

1. Go to an experience where you have server-side [Developer Console](../../studio/developer-console.md) access.

2. Click the **Play** button from the playtesting options.

   <img src="../../assets/studio/general/Quick-Access-Toolbar-Play.png" alt="Play button highlighted in Studio's playtesting options." width="228" />

3. Press <kbd>Left Shift</kbd> and <kbd>P</kbd>.

Once in free camera mode, you can use the following controls:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Keys/shortcuts</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera forward/left/back/right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>E</kbd></td>
    <td>Moves the camera down/up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd></td>
    <td>Tilts the camera left/right (roll).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    <td>In combination with any movement key, changes the camera speed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Right mouse button**</td>
    <td>When pressed, dragging the mouse moves the camera view around.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mouse scroll wheel**</td>
    <td>Zooms the camera in or out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>&nbsp;(Windows)<br /><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>G</kbd> (Mac)</td>
    <td>Disables all `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis` but not user-created GUIs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>C</kbd>&nbsp;(Windows)<br /><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> (Mac)</td>
    <td>Disables all user-created GUIs but not `Class.CoreGui|CoreGuis`.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Best practices

To create the most positive impact for users looking to play your experience, consider the following best practices.

<Alert severity="warning">
In addition to the practices shown below, avoid placing any essential text or elements at the **bottom** of the thumbnail, as it may potentially be covered by metadata like the player count.
</Alert>

### Quality and aspect ratio

A thumbnail image should be **16:9** aspect ratio and ideally **1920×1080 pixels** so that it always displays in high resolution across the Roblox site and app. Displayed thumbnails will be stretched to 16:9 aspect ratio regardless of the upload's aspect ratio.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-High-Res.jpg" alt="High quality and sharp thumbnail" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="success">High quality and sharp; upload in 16:9 aspect ratio</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Not-16-9.jpg" alt="Non-16:9 thumbnail" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="error">Upload not in 16:9 aspect ratio; displayed thumbnail stretched</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

### Relevant content

A thumbnail will have a higher impact if it's unique and provides relevant imagery on what users should expect when they join the experience. Thumbnails with ambiguous imagery or graphics may lead to unnecessary confusion.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Urban-Rush.jpg" alt="Thumbnail portraying a high-action urban racing experience" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="success">Thumbnail portrays a high‑action urban racing experience</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
	<figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Unclear.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with unclear imagery and an ambiguous graphic in the top-right corner" />
    <figcaption>
      <Alert severity="error">Unclear imagery and ambiguous graphic in top‑right corner</Alert>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

### Theme and color

You can express your experience's theme through overall theme and colors to help users decide if it's suitable and appealing to them.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Theme-Comical.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with a comical theme/character and bright colors" />
    <figcaption>Comical theme/character with bright colors</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../assets/publishing/experience-metadata/Thumbnail-Theme-Horror.jpg" alt="Thumbnail with a dark and stormy theme for a horror experience" />
    <figcaption>Dark and stormy theme for a horror experience</figcaption>
