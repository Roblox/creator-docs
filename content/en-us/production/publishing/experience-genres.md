Your experience's **genre** and optional **subgenre** are displayed on the experience's main page to help users better understand what kind of gameplay to expect. Roblox also uses this information when placing experiences in genre-specific top and trending sorts on the Charts page.

## Updating Genres

You can update your experience's genre and optional subgenre in the Creator Dashboard.

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
You can only change genres once every three months. When creating a new experience, you should only select a genre once you're confident what genre your experience is.
</Alert>

To update your genre:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
2. Click on the thumbnail of the experience you want to update the genre for. The experience's Overview page displays.
3. In the left-hand navigation, select **Configure** &rarr; **Settings**.
4. Select the genre of your experience. For additional guidance, see [Best Practices](#best-practices).
5. **(Optional)** Select a subgenre if one applies.

When you update your genre, the genre immediately updates on your experience's main page, but it may take a few days to reflect in other Discovery systems like genre-specific sorts in Charts.

## Genre Accuracy

To ensure genres are accurate and relevant for users, Roblox regularly reviews experiences and may update any genre selections that appear inaccurate. If Roblox updates your experience's genre, you will be notified by email and the change will appear on the experience's Settings page.

When Roblox changes your genre, you can appeal the decision if you think Roblox made a mistake.

To appeal a genre change made by Roblox:

1. Confirm that Roblox changed your genre by viewing the change on your experience's **Settings** page within the Creator Dashboard.
2. Navigate to [roblox.com/support](http://roblox.com/support).
3. Confirm that you are logged into your Roblox account with edit permissions for the experience.
4. Select the **Experience Genre** help category, and provide the [Universe ID](../../cloud/open-cloud/data-store-api-handling.md#universe-id) of your experience in the **Universe ID** field.
5. Click **Continue** to submit your appeal.

Roblox will review your appeal and notify you of the outcome, usually within a few days. If your appeal is accepted, your genre will reset back to the previous genre before Roblox changed it. If your appeal is rejected, your genre will remain the same, and you won't be able to appeal the decision again.

<Alert severity ='warning'>
If your appeal has not yet been reviewed and you update your genre through the regular selection flow, your original appeal will not be reviewed.

## Best Practices

Selecting a genre helps users discover and understand what to expect from your experience. Consider the following best practices to select the most relevant genre for your experience.

- **Primary purpose and core gameplay** — Sometimes there isn't a genre that perfectly describes your experience, or multiple genres can be valid. In these cases, it's recommended to pick the genre that fits best and describes the primary purpose or core gameplay loop of your experience.
- **Selecting a subgenre** — While genres give users a broad sense of what kind of gameplay to expect, subgenres help describe the core mechanics of your experience in more detail. It's recommended to select a subgenre if one applies. However, if there isn't a subgenre that fits your experience, you can still select a genre without a subgenre.
- **Genre and subgenre descriptions** — Refer to the [genre and subgenre descriptions](#genre-and-subgenre-descriptions) to compare genres and help you make the best choice for your experience.
