## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionSummary>
<Typography variant="h6">What is copyright?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
Copyright is a legal protection granted for original works of authorship. Copyright protects many different types of creative works including music, movies, pictures, and books among others. Copyright does not protect facts or ideas but it may protect the specific expression of a fact or idea. To learn more about copyright visit the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html).

It is important to note that you can still infringe a copyright even if you:

- Didn't monetize your experience.
- Credited the original creator.
- Downloaded the content from the internet.
- Thought that your use was a [fair use](https://copyright.gov/fair-use/).
- Purchased a physical copy of the content (DVD, game, etc.).
- Saw other people include the same content in their experiences.
- Explained that you didn't intend to infringe anyone's copyright.

<Typography variant="h6">What is the difference between copyright and trademark?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
Copyright is only one form of intellectual property law. Copyright incentivizes creators to create original works of authorship. Trademarks help avoid consumer confusion about the source of a product or service by protecting brand names, logos, or other symbols that distinguish the goods or services of one party from those of others.

<Typography variant="h6">What is the DMCA?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
The **Digital Millennium Copyright Act** ("DMCA") allows copyright holders or their agents to notify Roblox about material they believe infringes upon their copyrights and ask Roblox to remove it. To comply with the requirements of the DMCA, Roblox must respond expeditiously to valid DMCA notices. Roblox must also adopt and reasonably implement a policy providing for the termination in appropriate circumstances of users who are repeat copyright infringers.

- **How can I submit a DMCA claim?**

  If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and believe that
  any content on Roblox infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a
  notification pursuant to the DMCA by contacting our [Copyright Agent](mailto:copyright_agent@roblox.com), or Legal, Roblox Corporation, 3150 S. Delaware St. San Mateo, CA 94403. You may also contact us by phone at (888)&nbsp;858-2569.

- **What information must I provide when filing a DMCA claim?**

  - An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed.
  - A description of the copyright-protected work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed.
  - A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located.
  - Your address, telephone number, and email address.
  - A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of those materials is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
  - A statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.

- **When can I expect a reply to my DMCA claim?**

  If your notice complies with the DMCA, we will act fast to take down the allegedly infringing content, and in some circumstances we will act to promptly contact you to remedy deficiencies in the notice.

- **Will the other party receive my personal information when they receive a claim?**

  In some circumstances, we will share the name of the corporation or username of the individual who is submitting the claim.

<Typography variant="h6">What happens if I receive a DMCA takedown notice against something I've posted on Roblox?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
If you believe that your content on Roblox has been taken down because of mistake or misidentification (for example, you have authorization to use the removed content, or fair use applies) you may contest the takedown notice by submitting a DMCA counter‑notice.

- **How do I know if I received a DMCA takedown notice?**

  Among other things, Roblox will issue a warning on your account to notify you of the DMCA claim. We will also notify you via email (if an email address is associated with your account) and through Roblox's messaging system to provide you with more details.

  The message will be sent to the email associated with your Roblox account.

  If you don't have an email linked to your Roblox account, you will only receive a Roblox message. We highly encourage you to link an email to your Roblox account as a [security precaution](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313380-Account-Security-Keeping-your-Account-Safe-) and to receive such important emails from us.

- **What if a DMCA claim is made against my experience?**

  Should a valid claim be made against your experience, your experience will be taken down or access to it will be disabled.

  If your experience was taken down due to a DMCA notice, we generally are not in a position to reopen the experience without the copyright owner's permission, unless you have filed a counter‑notice under the DMCA. Roblox is not in a position to obtain such permission on your behalf.

<Typography variant="h6">How do I file a DMCA counter‑notice?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
When we notify you about DMCA notices, we also provide instructions about how to
submit a counter‑notice, which may be sent to our DMCA agent:
copyright_agent@roblox.com. Note that if you are under 13 years of age, a parent or other adult representative will have to submit the counter‑notice on your behalf.

- **What will happen after I submit a DMCA counter‑notice?**

  If we determine that your counter‑notice is valid, we will forward it to the person who submitted the copyright takedown notice. Based on a valid counter‑notice, Roblox will generally restore your content within 10-14 business days, unless we are informed that a lawsuit was filed against you.

  Be aware that submitting a counter‑notice may have serious consequences. If the person who submitted the copyright takedown notice believes that your counter‑notice is not accurate, or your content is infringing, they may file a lawsuit against you. Also, submitting a knowingly false counter‑notice is illegal and can subject you to liability.
