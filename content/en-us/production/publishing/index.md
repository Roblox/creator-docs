Publishing your experiences, assets, and accessories to Roblox allows you to make your content available to other users to use within their own experiences and on their avatars.

## Experiences

When you [publish an experience](../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md) in Studio, Roblox creates a details page that displays the experience's icon and description. At first this page is private and only accessible to you or members of your group with the correct permissions, but when you're ready, you can release the experience to the public. This allows users to find your experience's details page through the Home, Search, or Discover page.

Once an experience is published, you can access the [Game Settings](../../studio/game-settings.md) window, which includes global settings for the experience, such as permissions, monetization, security, and localization options. For more information, see [Publishing Experiences and Places](../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md).

## Assets

As long as you are the original creator and that the asset adheres to Roblox's [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), you can publish any mesh or image that you have imported through the [Asset Manager](../../projects/assets/manager.md) or [3D Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md), or any model or plugin that you have uploaded to your inventory in the [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md). When you publish any of these assets, the [Creator Marketplace](../../production/publishing/creator-marketplace.md) makes it automatically available to other creators to use within their experiences.

While there are limits on the number of assets you can publish per 30 days, you can [verify your account](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md) to publish more of each asset type and maximize their discoverability, as well as sell your plugins. For more information, see [Publishing Assets](../../production/publishing/publishing-assets.md).

## Accessories and Clothing

If you are a creator participating in the [UGC program](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990), you can upload and sell avatar accessories and clothing assets on the [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog), assuming they meet the [marketplace policy](../../art/marketplace/marketplace-policy.md) and any applicable [technical specifications](../../art/accessories/specifications.md#marketplace-requirements).

Once they pass moderation, you can:

- Set your Robux price for each asset's specific asset type.
- Limit the number of copies available for purchase, increasing the rarity of your asset.
- Provide exclusive items or discounts to Premium users.
- Specify if you also want your asset to be available for purchase within experiences through the [Inspect Menu](../../players/avatar-inspect-menu.md) or the [Avatar Editor Service](../../players/avatar-editor.md).
