description: Explains how to publish assets to the Creator Marketplace.
---

**Publishing assets** to the [Creator Marketplace](../../production/publishing/creator-marketplace.md) is the only way to make your assets publicly available to all users to use within their own experiences in Studio. You can publish any mesh or image that you have imported through the [Asset Manager](../../projects/assets/manager.md), or any [model](../../parts/models.md) or [plugin](../../studio/plugins.md) that you have uploaded to your inventory.

There are limits on the number of assets you can publish per 30 days, depending on whether you've [verified your account](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md):

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Mesh Assets</th>
    <th>Image Assets</th>
	<th>Model Assets</th>
	<th>Plugins</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Verified account</td>
    <td>200</td>
    <td>200</td>
	<td>200</td>
	<td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unverified account</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>10</td>
	<td>10</td>
	<td>2</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Alert severity="warning">
Make sure that every asset you import adheres to the [Community Rules](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410) and [Terms of Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846), and remember to review the [DMCA Guidelines](../../production/publishing/dmca-guidelines.md) regarding copyright.

## Through Studio

You can publish assets directly in Studio through the [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md) without needing to access the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations). To publish an asset within Studio:

1. Navigate to the [View](../../studio/view-tab.md) tab of the menu bar and select **Toolbox**. The [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md) window displays.

1. Click on the **Inventory** tab.

1. Click the **category selector** dropdown and select the asset type you'd like to publish. All assets you have [previously imported](../../projects/assets/manager.md#importing-assets) display within the chosen category.

1. Right-click on your desired asset to publish and select **Edit Asset**. The **Asset Configuration** dialog displays.
1. **(Optional)** If you are [ID or phone verified](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md), click the **+** button to add up to 5 supplementary thumbnails for your asset.

1. Enable the **Distribute on Marketplace** toggle.
1. **(Optional)** If you are [ID or phone verified](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md) and are publishing a plugin, input the amount of Robux you want to charge for the plugin in the **Price** field. If you keep the default value of **0**, the plugin is free to all creators.

1. Click the **Submit** button.

The asset is now public and visible to everyone within the [Creator Marketplace](../../production/publishing/creator-marketplace.md).

## Through Creator Dashboard

Publishing assets through the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) is useful when you are doing multiple tasks in quick succession for an experience. To publish an asset through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
1. In the horizontal navigation, select [DEVELOPMENT ITEMS](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations?activeTab=Model). All assets you have [previously imported](../../projects/assets/manager.md#importing-assets) display within their respective category.
1. Select the asset that you want to publish. The asset's **Configure** page displays.
1. In the **Settings** section, enable the **Distribute on Marketplace** toggle.
1. **(Optional)** If you are [ID or phone verified](../../production/publishing/account-verification.md) and are publishing a plugin, input the amount of Robux you want to charge for the plugin in the **Price** field. If you keep the default value of **0**, the plugin is free to all creators.
1. Click the **Save** button.

The asset is now public and visible to everyone within the [Creator Marketplace](../../production/publishing/creator-marketplace.md).
