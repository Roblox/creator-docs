A high-quality **icon** is one of the most important factors in getting your experience noticed, as it's the first image users see when
the experience displays on the [Discover](https://www.roblox.com/discover#/) page. With such prominent placement, it's recommended that the icon expresses the theme, tone, and/or genre of the experience.

When you [publish an experience](../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md) for the first time, an icon is automatically generated from a collection of default images. While you can only display one icon per [locale](../../production/localization/index.md), you can also include supplementary [image and video thumbnails](../../production/promotion/promotional-thumbnails.md) that further promote the experience.

For more information on maximizing the impact of your experience's icon, see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

## Uploading Icons

To ensure your experience's icon always displays in high resolution and with an ideal aspect ratio, use a template of **512×512 pixels**. In some places on the Roblox site and app, icons scale down to smaller sizes like 150×150 pixels, so it's recommended that you preview an icon at smaller sizes to confirm its details remain clear. In addition, see [Best&nbsp;Practices](#best-practices) for tips on icon format and design.

To upload an experience icon:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).
1. Click on the experience you want to upload an icon for. The experience's **Overview** page displays.
1. In the left-hand navigation, under **Configure**, select **Places**.

1. Click the **start place** marked with a star icon (if the experience contains only one place, it will be the only option). The place's **Basic Settings** page displays.

1. In the place's left-hand navigation menu, select **Icon**.

1. Set the media type to **Image** and click the **CHANGE** button. Then, from the file browser, select and confirm the image you want to use as the icon. Note that all icon images must pass [moderation](../../projects/assets/index.md#asset-moderation) before they appear to others on the Roblox platform.

1. If the preview icon appears as you expect, click **Save Changes**.

## Best Practices

To create the most positive impact for users looking to play your experience, consider the following best practices.

### Quality and Aspect Ratio

When you upload an icon image, it should be **square** and at least **512×512 pixels** so that it always displays in high resolution and at an ideal aspect ratio across the Roblox site and app.

### Relevant Content

An icon will have a higher impact if it's unique and provides relevant imagery on what users should expect when they join the experience. Icons with ambiguous graphics may lead to unnecessary confusion.

### Color and Contrast

You can express your experience's theme through color and contrast to help users decide if it's suitable and appealing to them.
