title: The Roblox user base
description: Explains the distinct qualities of Roblox's user base and culture.
---

Roblox's user base is distinct from other platforms in both its demographics and its expectations. Understanding the composition and culture of the Roblox community is essential to reaching a wider audience and achieving any measure of success with your experience.

Roblox users value three fundamental strengths of the platform:

- **Content variety** &ndash; the collective depth of the millions of unique user-generated experiences attracts and maintains a massive user base for all experiences.

- **Low friction** &ndash; users can launch a new experience and start playing in seconds on almost any device. This ease of entry contributes to strong organic traffic and low UA costs.

- **Social connection** &ndash; Roblox is in part a social network where users often play with their connections. A strong social component can massively accelerate growth and engagement for many experiences.

Always bear in mind how your experience plays to these strengths when designing for the Roblox audience.

## Demographics

Part of what makes Roblox so special is the **diversity** and **inclusivity** of its community and its content, whether that's giving a safe space for gender identities, the creation of inclusive content, or the wide variety of developers creating content on the platform.

Roblox's user base now has more users that are at least 13 years old than under the age of 13. Understanding how Roblox works and its network effects will require some focus on younger users, but there's a growing opportunity to create content for their older counterparts.

Roblox is also expanding **geographically**. While the US, UK and Canada are still the biggest regions in terms of users, Europe, APAC, and the rest of the world are growing more year over year. As more local developers come online from around the world, this growth is only set to continue.

## User behavior on the platform

A Roblox session typically means **playing a handful of different experiences**. Roblox is closer in many ways to YouTube than the App Store. It's important to realize that individual experiences fit into a larger, overarching experience. While some users do focus their attention in a session on one experience, it's very common for users to join an experience for a short time, switch to another, and repeat. User behavior in your experience may reflect this in more ways than just session length.

Understanding your audience means understanding the other experiences your users engage with regularly. Since experiences are so interconnected, there tends to be a lot of **common conventions** and **mechanics** across the platform. Studying and emulating these conventions helps your users familiarize themselves with your experience quickly and may reduce the risk of them bouncing off in frustration. For more about designing for behavior on the platform, see [Design for Roblox](../production/game-design/index.md).

### Social factors

Roblox allows users to add **Connections**, join them in their experience, and invite them to yours. Chat is built directly into every experience, so news spreads fast from user to user. In addition to socializing in various user made Groups on-platform, users are often active on platforms like Discord and X (Twitter).

Engaging experiences will generate a lot of **organic traffic** through word of mouth. Users find an experience they like, invite their connections, and then those connections invite more connections. YouTube can also attract a lot of attention, as users want to try out whatever their favorite YouTuber is playing. For more on generating traffic and building a community, see [Promote on Roblox](../production/promotion/index.md).

## Roblox culture

Roblox culture represents the dominant gaming, social, and consumer culture of the future. It has its own vocabulary, memes, celebrities, and even myths. Understanding the culture is essential to understanding your users.

The sharing of **community-generated content** is the foundation of Roblox culture. Users see developers as celebrity peers. Iteration happens fast, leveraging real-time user feedback. Because of the prominent role of organic, word-of-mouth traffic for success on Roblox, **communicating with users is critical**.
