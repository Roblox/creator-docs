title: Earn on Roblox
description: Explains how Roblox's economy and virtual currency works.
---

Roblox's goal is to enable the creation of anything, anywhere, by anyone, and we are constantly
investing in new tools and services to empower our creator community. We give our creators, from an
individual to a large studio, diverse ways to earn on Roblox by creating content and experiences,
specifically:

- [Develop an experience](#develop-an-experience)
  - [In-experience purchases](#in-experience-purchases)
  - [Immersive ads](#immersive-ads)
- [Creator Rewards](#creator-rewards)
- [Create, sell, and resell certain avatar items](#create-sell-and-resell-certain-avatar-items)
- [Create and sell Studio plugins and models](#create-and-sell-studio-plugins-and-models)

This page provides information about different ways to earn on Roblox and how to [convert earned Robux to cash](#convert-earned-robux-to-cash) through the [Developer Exchange][Link_Developer_Exchange] program.

## Economy powered by creators

We are building one of the world's largest immersive platforms with 151.5M global daily active users (DAUs) in 17 languages across 180 countries, available across platforms including mobile, desktop, consoles, and VR headsets. In 2024, approximately 60% of our daily active users were 13 and over, and users aged 17 and over accounted for 44% of our daily active users. In 2024, our community visited over 14 million experiences. In the third quarter of 2025 alone, users spent 39.6 billion hours on our platform.

<p><Typography variant="h5" color="primary">We are one of the biggest virtual economies</Typography>&nbsp;<Typography variant="captionHeader" color="info">⑶</Typography></p>
Roblox's GDP <Typography variant="captionHeader" color="info">⑷ </Typography> has grown to become as large as that of some countries. Our success is directly tied to the success of our creators. Roblox earns money by selling Robux which users spend in‑experience and on items and assets in our marketplaces, all created by you.

<p><Typography variant="h5" color="primary">We exist to serve our community</Typography></p>
We're always searching for new ways to increase creators' earnings. In 2024, our creator community earned \$923 million. We've paid our developer community \$3.3 billion since 2018.

<p><Typography variant="h5" color="primary">As a result, creators can focus on creating</Typography></p>
We are seeing healthy growth across creators and studios of varying sizes. Since 2019, the average annual earnings of the top 10 and top 1000 creators has increased by ~5.5 and ~6.8 times, respectively.&nbsp;<Typography variant="captionHeader" color="info">⑸</Typography><br /><br />

## Develop an experience

Building successful content takes time and effort, but there is low risk and low upfront cost to building an experience on Roblox. You pay **after** earning on Roblox and we provide the tools, services, and support to help you build the most immersive experiences. Roblox has a robust community and [developer forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/) to guide and support you along the way.

### Low upfront costs; publish globally in seconds

<h5>Instant publishing to reach a global audience</h5>
Unlike other platforms where you wait days or weeks for approvals, you can modify your Roblox experiences and publish immediately in multiple languages and on all popular platforms&nbsp;&mdash; iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, PlayStation, and Xbox.

<h5>Platform-driven discovery and rapid viral growth</h5>
Our platform, with 151.5 million daily active users (DAUs) now able to see and join experiences with no additional downloads required, provides opportunity for rapid growth. Creators can take advantage of our organic channels, our rich social graph and network effect, seamless exploration between experiences and our cost effective [Roblox&nbsp;ads](../production/promotion/advertise-on-roblox.md).

<h5>Rapid iteration and scaling with no upfront costs</h5>
With your content live and in front of lots of users, we provide a rapid and rich feedback loop on how users are engaging with your work. This feedback loop is facilitated both by our integrated [analytics](../production/analytics/index.md) system and by our monetization mechanisms. On the cost side, we handle infrastructure hosting, storage, customer support, localization, payment processing, moderation, and platform costs. You do not have to worry about standing up multiplayer servers or scaling them as your experience goes viral. Off Roblox, you often have to take care of these expenses and manage these operations yourself.

<h5>Pay after you earn on Roblox</h5>
On other platforms, you can incur expenses such as storage, hosting, and infrastructure before you earn any money or even start building. On Roblox, developing an experience has minimal risk as you are charged for these expenses after you monetize.

### Average cash payouts

One of our goals is to drive as much money to our creators as possible while maintaining reasonable margins for our company to develop, maintain, and improve the tools and technology that support our community.

On average, 67% of all spending in experiences supports or goes to developers. The below applies to Robux spending within experiences only; it excludes developer subscriptions which are a relatively small portion of the business today.

- We pay out 40% to cover costs supporting experiences&nbsp;&mdash; like infrastructure hosting, storage, customer support, localization, payment processing, and moderation&nbsp;&mdash; which other platforms generally pass on to developers.
- This enables us to return 28%\* directly to the developers.
- That leaves 33% to cover Roblox's ongoing services and operating costs, future-looking investments in the platform, and margins.

This chart illustrates the estimated utilization of each dollar spent in an experience on Roblox. Note that the chart doesn't reflect our expenses as disclosed in our GAAP financial statements.

Each developer's earnings share may differ. Earnings share may also differ by payment channel; users can now receive up to 25% more Robux when purchasing through gift cards, computer, or web. This extra Robux translates into higher revenue shares on Robux purchased on those channels.</p>

### Experience monetization

Once you've developed an experience, you can earn through the following methods:

#### In-experience purchases

- [Subscriptions](./monetization/subscriptions.md) within experiences offer you the ability to earn from your experience through subscription-based offerings and business models.
- [Developer Products](../production/monetization/developer-products.md), which are items or abilities that a user can purchase, such as in-experience currency.
- [Passes](../production/monetization/passes.md) for access to special privileges within an experience, such as entry to a restricted area or a permanent power‑up. When you sell your own passes in your experience, you earn 70% of the Robux spent. You can also sell passes within your experience that were made by other creators; in this case, you earn a 10% affiliate fee on the Robux spent within your experience, and the original creator of the pass earns 60%.
- [Private servers](../production/monetization/private-servers.md) for users to play with just connections (subscription-based access fees).

#### Creator Rewards

Developers earn extra Robux for simply building an engaging experience. Roblox calculates
[payouts](../creator-rewards.md) based on how Active Spenders use your experience on a daily basis, and these payouts happen
automatically as a way to reward engaging experiences.

#### Immersive ads

[Immersive ads](../production/monetization/immersive-ads.md) allow developers to place high-quality, native ad units in their experience that will programmatically serve ads. Creators are paid through a revenue share for the video views, impressions, and teleports generated.

## Create, sell, and resell certain avatar items

Millions of users already visit the [Marketplace][Link_Marketplace] every day. [Eligible](../marketplace/marketplace-policy.md#creator-requirements) creators can [create](../marketplace/publish-to-marketplace.md) and sell [accessories](../art/accessories/index.md), [clothing](../art/accessories/index.md), and [avatar bodies and heads](../art//characters/index.md) in the Marketplace or in their own or other developers' experiences. We have a breadth of ways users can discover and buy your creations, whether through searching the Marketplace or enabling developers to promote and sell your items. Users can purchase your item within an experience using the [Avatar Inspect Menu](../players/avatar-inspect-menu.md) or in templates such as [UGC Homestore](../resources/templates.md#ugc-homestore). You can also increase the discoverability of your 3D user-generated content within the Marketplace through [sponsored item](../production/promotion/sponsor-items.md) ads.

After you pay any applicable upload and publishing fees and submit a new asset for approval, the moderation team reviews your asset and, if approved, you'll be able to publish your asset to the Marketplace.

You receive a commission every time a user purchases your item. When community items are sold in the marketplace, a portion of the sales is split between the item creator and Roblox. If the item is sold within an experience, the revenue share will additionally be split with the owner of the experience who we refer to as an "affiliate." An affiliate earns commission for marketing another user's creations.

As follows is an overview of our commission structure. To learn more about fees and commissions for the Marketplace, see [Marketplace fees and commissions](../marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="3D Avatar Assets">
<Grid container spacing={2}>
<Grid item XSmall={12} XLarge={7}>
<h5>In-experience purchase</h5>

- Creator receives **30%**
- Affiliate (experience owner) receives **40%**
- Platform receives **30%**

<h5>Marketplace purchase</h5>

- Creator of the virtual item receives **30%**
- Affiliate (Roblox) receives **40%**
- Platform receives **30%**

These commissions also apply to the original sale of [Limiteds](../marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md#limiteds). When setting assets on sale, you can [configure](../marketplace/publish-to-marketplace.md#marketplace-settings) your creation as a Limited item to set an available quantity for that asset. Limiteds require a [per-unit fee](../marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md#per-unit-fee) and can be [resold](../marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md#reselling) by [Roblox Premium](https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership) members. At this time, only Roblox-created Limiteds are tradeable.

<TabItem label="Community-created Limiteds">
<Grid container spacing={2}>
<Grid item XSmall={12} XLarge={7}>
While anyone can buy a Limited item, only Roblox [Premium][Link_Premium_Membership] subscribers can resell them. Every time a creator's Limited item is resold, the creator benefits from a 10% original creator commission on the value of each resale.

- Reseller receives **50%**
- Creator receives **10%**
- Affiliate receives **10%**
- Platform receives **30%**

After purchasing a Limited, there is up to a 30‑day holding period when the item cannot be resold. Robux acquired from trading or selling items that you didn't create are not considered earned and are ineligible for the [Developer Exchange][Link_Developer_Exchange] program.

## Create and sell Studio plugins and models

You can create and sell Studio [plugins](../studio/plugins.md) and [models](../parts/models.md) to the creator community through the [Creator Store](../production/creator-store.md). A [plugin](../studio/plugins.md) is an extension that adds additional functionality to Studio, and a [model](../parts/models.md) is a reusable asset type. You can offer both to other creators on the [Creator Store](../production/creator-store.md) for free, or you can sell them for **United States Dollars** (the minimum price is \$4.99 for plugins and \$2.99 for models). Roblox offers a market-leading revenue share for these sales, as only taxes and payment processing fees are deducted. For more information, see [Sell on the Creator Store](../production/sell-on-creator-store.md).

## Join the Creator Affiliate Program

<Alert severity="info">
To join the Creator Affiliate Program, you must be 13+ and reside in a country supported by the [Developer Exchange][Link_Developer_Exchange] program.
</Alert>

The [Creator Affiliate Program](https://create.roblox.com/affiliate) is a pilot program that lets you earn Robux using affiliate links. With it, you can:

- Generate affiliate share links for any Roblox experience, including other developers' experiences, through the Creator Hub.
- Promote your affiliate links off-platform on social media channels.
- Earn revenue in Robux whenever new users create a Roblox account and purchase Robux using your affiliate link. A new user is someone who doesn't already have an alternative Roblox account.
- Exchange your Robux earnings for real-world money using the Developer Exchange program.

When a user creates a Roblox account using your affiliate link and then buys Robux, you can receive up to 50% of the value of their Robux purchases during their first six months on the platform, for a maximum revenue of \$100 USD per new user. For example, if a new user joins Roblox and purchases \$100 USD of Robux, you can earn up to \$50 USD, minus certain fees like taxes and VAT.

You receive your revenue in Robux, which you can exchange for real-world money through Developer Exchange.

## Convert earned Robux to cash

Once you earn Robux, you can continue to use it in our platform to buy developer assets, plugins, [advertising](../production/promotion/advertise-on-roblox.md), in-experience items, or virtual items. In addition, when you have at least 30,000 earned Robux in your account, you may be eligible to exchange your earned Robux for real currency using the [Developer Exchange][Link_Developer_Exchange] program.

To learn more about strategies to earn Robux, see [Monetization](../production/monetization/index.md).

## Frequently asked questions

<BaseAccordion>
<AccordionSummary>
<Typography variant="subtitle2">Who can earn on Roblox?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
Any user can earn Robux on Roblox, however you must be a creator who is 13 years of age or older and have the requisite minimum amount of earned Robux in your account in order to convert your earned Robux to real currency through the [Developer Exchange][Link_Developer_Exchange] program. You must also meet certain other requirements such as having a verified email address and being in good standing within the community. Also, only those over the age of 18 may purchase Robux or engage in other real-money transactions on the platform per Roblox's [Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Use](https://www.roblox.com/info/terms).

Users, unlike creators, cannot convert in-experience virtual currency for real-world currency on Roblox. Creators do have the ability to convert (if, for example, they earn Robux via an experience they create) but Robux acquired from trading or reselling virtual items is not eligible to be converted.

</BaseAccordion>

<BaseAccordion>
<AccordionSummary>
<Typography variant="subtitle2">Other platforms advertise giving a higher share to their creators, why is that?</Typography>
</AccordionSummary>
<AccordionDetails>
Every platform reports their creator share a bit differently. When you compare creator shares across platforms, you should consider:

- **The breadth of business models** &mdash; While some platforms may have a high creator share, the opportunities to earn and the ways to earn may be limited, making the absolute earning potential on the platform smaller.
- **The platform may also be competing for engagement and payouts** &mdash; Some platforms are actually also creators on their platform and therefore compete with their creators for engagement. Roblox does not.
- **Other platform benefits** &mdash; Creator shares can be high but consider other benefits that the platform provides such as costs that they are paying on your behalf, the scale and diversity of their audience, the devices/platforms they are available on, the types of creators that are earning, and more.
- **The total size of the payout pool** &mdash; Understand the total size of the platform's payout pool. Other platforms may invest less in growing their user base and making their products accessible in new markets across the globe. This may allow them to pay developers a higher share, but at the expense of slower growth and less total earnings being put in creators' pockets.
