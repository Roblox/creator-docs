Analytics Dashboard helps you measure and gain insight into your experience's performance to adjust content strategies. It visualizes standard key performance indicators (KPIs) of your experience to help you optimize your experience's full lifecycle, including:

- [Retention](../../production/analytics/retention.md) KPIs that measure how many users return to your experience again after their first visit.
- [Engagement](../../production/analytics/engagement.md) KPIs that reflect how users actively use your experience and represent your core user base.
- [Acquisition](../../production/analytics/acquisition.md) statistics that show you the sources of users finding your experience and how users from different sources convert.
- [Monetization](../../production/analytics/monetization.md) KPIs that help you understand the business performance of your experience.

Any experience with more than 10 Daily Active Users (DAU) and 10 play hours for 7 consecutive days is eligible for accessing all KPIs on the dashboard.

The dashboard also provides the following statistics data:

- [Sales Data](#sales-data) that you can download and analyze in custom ways.
- [Developer Statistics](#developer-statistics) on your experience health and revenue that you can view and download.

## Setting Up Analytics Dashboard

If you are an experience owner or a group owner, and your experience meets the enrollment requirements, you can enroll in Analytics Dashboard at any point with the following steps:

1. Make sure that you have a verified email address and a 2-Step Verification method on your Roblox account.

2. Navigate to the experience overview page on the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/creations).

3. Read Roblox **Terms of Use** that pop out automatically. Click **Agree** if you agree to them.

Now you have access to the main dashboard on the **Overview** and dashboards of all KPI categories, including **Engagement**, **Retention**, and **Monetization**.

<Alert severity="info">
If you don't want to activate the dashboard immediately, or you accidentally decline the **Terms of Use**, you can still use the **Activate Analytics** button on the experience overview page to read the **Terms of Use** and agree to them any time. Refresh the page if you don't see the button.
</Alert>

### Granting Group Permission

By default, for a [group experience](../../projects/groups.md), only the group owner with the "Create and edit group experiences" permission can view the analytics dashboard because some KPIs are sensitive information, such as your revenue. You can grant permission for your group members to access the analytics dashboard with the following steps:

1. Select the group you want to grant permission on the [Groups](https://www.roblox.com/groups) page.

2. Click the **...** button and select **Configure Group** in the dropdown menu.

3. Navigate to the **Roles** tab. Select an existing role that you want to grant access to the analytics dashboard or create a new role.

4. In the **Assets** section, toggle on **View group experience analytics**.

<Alert severity="info">
The "View group experience analytics" and "Create and edit group experiences" permissions are independent. Turning on one of them doesn't affect the other, so you can let group members view the analytics dashboard for group experiences even if they can't edit those experiences.
</Alert>

## Dashboard Functionalities

After activating the analytics dashboard, you can view the default charts on the overview and each KPI category. Hover over the **Information Icon** to understand what each chart represents and the **View Icon** to understand how to interpret the summary statistics on the top of each chart.

There are also functionalities on each dashboard to help you further analyze your experience's performance, such as [filtering by date](#filtering-by-date), [exporting charts](#exporting-a-chart), [benchmarking](#benchmarking), and [viewing KPI Breakdowns](#viewing-kpi-breakdowns).

### Filtering by Date

You can apply a date filter to view the chart for a date range by separately selecting any specific time frame between the first date that the data was available and the present day as the start and the end date.

### Exporting a Chart

To export a chart to use with other data analytics tools, click the **Export Button** and save the metrics in a `.csv` file. The file includes timestamps and values of each datapoint per KPI.

<Alert severity="info">
You can't export the chart data for the given KPI chart if you don't have any data for your experience. This is due to either you enroll in the dashboard for less than 48 hours or you don't have any users for the given timeframe.
</Alert>

### Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the process of measuring your experience's KPIs and comparing them to other experiences on Roblox. With benchmarks displayed on your dashboard, you can monitor the performance of your experience's analytics KPIs among experiences on Roblox to adjust your content strategy and set appropriate goals for improvement.

For KPIs relevant to specific aspects of your user behavior, Analytics Dashboard provides **similar experience benchmarks**. These benchmarks help you compare your experience with similar experiences with at least 100 Daily Active Users, such as those under the same genre as yours on the **Home** and **Discovery** pages. Available KPIs for similar experience benchmarks include:

- **Retention** - All KPIs

- **Engagement**- Average Session Time

- **Monetization** - Average Revenue per Paying Users (ARPPU), Average Revenue per DAU (ARPDAU), Conversion Rate (CVR)

Each of these KPIs shows its similar experience benchmark in the 50th - 90th percentile range. For example, if you see your Day 1 Retention benchmark's 50th - 90th percentile is 12.4% - 24.1%, it means that:

- 50% of similar experiences have a Day 1 Retention of 12.4% or lower.

- 10% of similar experiences have a Day 1 Retention of 24.1% or higher.

<img src="../../assets/analytics/analytics-dashboard/benchmark-similar-exp.png" width= "100%" alt="An example shows the D7 retention chart with similar experience benchmarking." />

For KPIs on your experience's overall success, Analytics Dashboard uses the top 1000 experiences with the highest total playtime on rolling 30 days as the benchmarking pool, excluding experiences that are less than 30 days old. Each of these KPIs has **Top 200**, **Top 500**, and **Top 1000** as benchmarking tiers. The dashboard displays the appropriate tier for your experience based on your experience's engagement metrics and updates them on a daily basis,

### Viewing KPI Breakdowns

You can apply a breakdown to analyze each chart in a more specific category by clicking the **Breakdown by** and toggling between the breakdown types, including **Age Group**, **Platform**, **OS**, **Country**, and **Language**. The following table explains the subcategories and usage of each breakdown type. You might also see an "Unknown" subcategory refers to users without relevant data.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Breakdown Type</th>
    <th>Subcategories</th>
    <th>Usage</th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Age Group</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Language (top 5)</td>
    <td>The top 5 languages where your experience has the most Daily Active Users, an "Other" category as the aggregate of all other languages where you have users based on their playtime instead of the languages you offer, and the total number of Daily Active Users.</td>
    <td>Understand which languages are most popular across your users to help prioritize localization efforts. You can also see the impacts of adding translation for different languages.</td>

## Developer Statistics

With the **Developer Statistics** dashboard, you can view and download key statistics data on your experience health and revenue for custom analytics. The dashboard includes the following statistics:

- [Live stats](#live-stats) on the amount of users currently visiting an experience and the platform they are using.
- [Filtered devices](#filtered-devices) that can't access your experience due to performance issues and their crash rate.
- [Historical data](#historical-data) on the total number of user visits and the average amount of time each user stayed by platform and time range.
- [Developer Product sales](#developer-product-sales) daily and monthly stats.
- [Premium](../../production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts.md#accessing-payout-data) membership payout and visit data.

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
The Developer Statistics dashboard is a legacy feature that might not reflect the real-time data of your experience. Use alternatives such as [Sales Data](#sales-data) and [Engagement Dashboard](../../production/analytics/engagement.md) for more accurate statistics.
</Alert>

### Accessing Developer Statistics

To access the Developer Statistics dashboard of your or your group's experience:

1. Navigate to the [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/creations) page of **Creator Dashboard**, which lists all your experiences.
   - For group-owned experiences, click the **CREATOR** dropdown to select the target group.
2. Select the experience for which you want to view the developer stats.
3. On the **ANALYTICS** category of the navigation menu, select **Developer Stats**.

### Live Stats

**Live Stats** displays the number of users in the entire experience and the number of live servers in use. In addition to the total number of users, it also has the number of users on each platform, including **Computer**, **Tablet**, **Phone**, and **Console**. The system updates the data every 30 seconds.

Live stats data is useful for learning the distribution of users on different platforms. When implementing features and evaluating performance, you can prioritize supporting the user-preferred platforms to retain your user base.

<img src="../../assets/analytics/developer-stats/Live-Stats.png" width= "80%" />

### Filtered Devices

**Filtered Devices** displays the devices that failed to access your experience due to performance issues. For each filtered device, the dashboard also provides a crash rate, which is calculated by the number of client crashes / the number of successful client connections. The system clears and re-calculates filtered devices and crash rates every time you update your experience with a new version.

Filtered devices data is useful to determine how compatible your experience is with older hardware. If your experience has a variety of users from different platforms and no filtered devices, it is a good indicator that your experience is compatible with a wide variety of hardware.

### Historical Data

**Historical Data** displays hourly, daily, and monthly visit and revenue data of each platform, including **computer**, **tablet**, **phone**, and **console**. This data can help you understand your user retention and revenue based on the platform. The dashboard includes the following two charts:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Chart Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Visits</td>
      <td>The amount of times users have visited your experience.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average Visit Length</td>
      <td>The average amount of time in minutes that users have spent in your experience.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<img src="../../assets/analytics/developer-stats/Chart-Visits.png" width= "80%" />

### Developer Product Sales

**Developer Product Sales** displays the total number of users who visit your experience, the average amount of time they visit, and how much Robux you have earned from in-experience [Developer Product](../../production/monetization/developer-products.md) sales, in daily and monthly tables. You can filter the data by platform, including **computer**, **tablet**, **phone**, and **console**. This data is useful to see how much Developer Products contribute to your total Robux revenue and identify your most popular developer product.
