**Demographics** shows you the age, gender, country, and language of monthly active users who play your experience. You can use this data to prioritize future content updates and secure brand sponsorships.

To view your experience's demographic analytics:

1. Navigate to your [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard** and select your experience.
1. In the **Analytics** menu on the left, select **Demographics**.

You can view analytics for individual or group owned experiences. To view the latter, you need to have [group permissions for analytics](../../production/analytics/analytics-dashboard.md#grant-group-permission).
