**Monetization** measures your experience's ability to generate revenue.

## Viewing Monetization Metrics

To view your experience's monetization analytics:

1. Navigate to your [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard** and select your experience.

1. In the **ANALYTICS** menu, select **Monetization**.

You can view analytics for individual or group owned experience. To view the latter, you need to have [group permissions for analytics](../../production/analytics/analytics-dashboard.md#granting-group-permission).

On the monetization page, you can see the following metrics:

| Source          | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Revenue         | Hourly and daily revenue split by developer products, passes, and commissions. |
| Conversion rate | Percent of daily active users who are also paying users.                       |
| Paying users    | Number of daily active users who purchased an experience related item.         |
| ARPPU           | Average revenue per paying user.                                               |
| ARPDAU          | Average revenue per daily active user.                                         |

## Improving Revenue

Here are some high level tips for growing your revenue:

1. **Be thoughtful about monetization from the start**: Consider what users would spend on, why they would spend, and whether and how to expand monetization options in the future. It's more challenging to develop a monetization strategy after launching your experience.
1. **Design for short-term as well as long-term users**: Try to provide a mix of consumable and durable items for purchase to give options for users with different levels of engagement.
1. **Optimize your storefront**: Make it easy for users to find and understand the value of purchasable items. This ensures a transparent and easy-to-use experience.
1. **Balance your in-experience content**: Discounts, limited item offers, free items, and more can help you improve your in-experience economy.

Devote as much creativity and attention to your storefront as you do to the rest of the experience. Users would appreciate an easy-to-find shop that helps them learn more about the experience.

## Improving Payer Conversion Rate

Payer conversion measures the percent of your users who engage with your paid features or content.

To improve this metric:

1. **Identify why your conversion rate is low**: Reasons might include expensive items, poor item or shop visibility, and unappealing content.
2. **Consider welcome offers and discounts for first-time purchasers**: This can lower the barrier for new users to try out your paid content to see how fun it is.
3. **Analyze the purchase funnel and identify any issues**: Possible issues include unclear or confusing steps in the purchase flow or distractions that make it difficult for users to complete the process.

## Improving Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPPU)

ARPPU measures the spending behavior of your repeat purchasers.

To improve this metric:

1. **Add purchasing options for different levels of engagement**. Include a mix of items that are one-time purchases as well as repeatable purchases, such as consumables, refills, and in-game currencies for users who may wish to purchase them regularly.
2. **Provide a variety of purchasable items**. If you only have a limited number of sales items available, users might not have anything new to purchase even if they're interested in buying something new. You can find your top-selling items and expand those offerings to provide more options for users.
3. **Add seasonal items**. Seasonal items can create a sense of fun and excitement around particular holidays or real-world events.

## Improving Average Revenue per Daily Active Users (ARPDAU)

ARPDAU is a combination of your payer conversion rate and your ARPPU.

To improve ARPDAU:

1. **Provide items at a variety of price points**. Some users are only willing to spend a small amount of Robux for experience items. Selling items at a wide range of price points can accommodate users with different spending habits.
2. **Improve retention and engagement**. Keeping users engaged with your experience over time can lead to more opportunities for monetization, as well as increased loyalty and interest in making purchases.

A high ARPPU and low ARPDAU suggest revenue comes from a limited user subset. Balance your monetization by targeting a wider audience and improve both ARPPU and ARPDAU for long-term success.
