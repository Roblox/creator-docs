**Engagement** measures how engaging your experience is for users.

## Viewing Engagement Metrics

To view your experience's engagement analytics:

1. Navigate to your [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard** and select your experience.

1. In the **ANALYTICS** menu, select **Engagement**.

You can view analytics for individual or group owned experience. To view the latter, you need to have [group permissions for analytics](../../production/analytics/analytics-dashboard.md#granting-group-permission).

## Improving Average Session Time

Average session time is the total time users spend in your experience divided by the number of sessions. It's a key metric that's closely tied to retention. To ensure that users are having meaningful sessions, you need to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of engaging your users.

### Getting Users Into the Fun Immediately

Usually, the friction of joining and leaving an experience is very low on Roblox, so first impressions are extremely important, and you want to get users into the fun part of your experience as fast as possible with the following strategies:

1. **Ensure users have fun within the first five minutes of joining your experience**: Think about what makes your experience fun and what makes it stand out from other experiences. You should be able to communicate these to your users within the first five minutes of joining your experience.

2. **Get users into the action as soon as possible and avoid long tutorials**: If you lock all the fun of your game behind a lengthy tutorial, users might get bored and move on to something else. Make learning contextual and action based, such as short, unobtrusive pop-up instructions when a user encounters a new feature and tooltips about the purpose of items in the shop. Also consider giving users some starter items and currency to help them enjoy the core loop as soon as possible.

3. **Remove unnecessary barriers to social interaction**: Many successful experiences on Roblox highlight socializing with friends and other users a core part of their design. Try to design your experience to support group play and social interaction where possible.

### Give Users a Reason to Keep Coming Back

Regardless of what type of experiences you are designing, you want to design for repeat visits. You can adopt the following strategies to motivate your users to continually use your experience:

1. **Give users clear goals to work towards**: Think about what aspirational goals that your users might work for, such as completing a pet collection, getting the highest rank, and getting a rare item. Make sure users have clear short, mid, and long-term goals to work towards.
2. **Add a progression system to make content last**: Progression systems give users a clear path toward their goals and can make content last longer, so you have time to make more content before users unlock them.
3. **Balance the progression system to not gate off the fun**: If you add progression, make sure there is still enough content available upfront to ensure new users can still have fun in their first session.

### Monitor Your Experience's Performance

Performance is how well your experience runs on different devices and platforms. To improve your experience's performance:

1. **Test on various devices and platforms** to identify and fix performance issues.
2. **Limit excessive textures, meshes, and other variables** that might slow down your experience.
3. **Set up a user community** that can help identify bugs and crashes.

You can grow your experience faster if it's more engaging to both new and existing users. For more information on retaining your users for engagement, see [Retention](../../production/analytics/retention.md).
