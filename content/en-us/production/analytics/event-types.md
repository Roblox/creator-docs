</Alert>

Event types help you identify opportunities to grow and monetize your experience. They allow you to **integrate event tracking in your experience** and visualize your in-experience economy and player usage patterns on the Analytics dashboard

Once you begin tracking these events from your experience using the `Class.AnalyticsService`, new pages ([Economy](./economy-events.md) and [Funnels](./funnel-events.md)) appear under Analytics on the Creator Dashboard. You can use these dashboards to identify growth opportunities and segment users by age, gender, platform, OS and custom fields. All of these features are **free to use**.

## Categories

There are two categories with two corresponding dashboards: Economy and Funnel. Economy events let you track your in-experience economy, such as:

- **Top sinks** — What do users spend in-experience resources on?
- **Top sources** — Where do users earn resources?
- **Average wallet balance** — How much resources are users holding?

Funnel events let you track your user's progress through key stages of your experience. This includes:

- **Onboarding** - Where do users drop off when getting started with your experience?
- **Progression** - Where do users stop advancing through your experience?
- **Shop** - Where do users abandon purchases?

For more information on setting up these dashboards, see [Economy Events](./economy-events.md) and [Funnel Events](./funnel-events.md).

## Live Events

You can use the Live Events tool to check the events most recently fired by your experience. This can help you understand if your events are set up correctly. To access the tool:

1. Navigate to the Economy or Funnel pages of your Analytics dashboard for your experience;
2. Click the **Live Events** button at the top of each page to open the tool.
