description: An overview of topics to consider once you finish creating your experience.
---

Once you have created your experience, you may want to find an audience for it
and keep them engaged over time. You need to consider:

- **Publishing** to make it public for everyone to enjoy.

- **Promotion** to bring in new users.

- **Monetization** strategies for selling any products within it.

- **Localization** to help users around the world understand it.

- **Analytics** to monitor how it's performing.

- **Game design** to create and maintain an engaging player experience.

## Publishing

When an experience is ready to play, you can [publish](../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md) your
experience on any devices you choose. An experience can be published **privately** (default) in order to test and save to the cloud, or **publicly** so that it can be discovered and played by other users.

## Monetization

Users can spend Robux in experiences for items such as new vehicles or
power-ups, and creators can also earn Robux from [engagement-based payouts](../production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts.md), [private servers](../production/monetization/private-servers.md), [paid access in Robux](../production/monetization/paid-access-robux.md), and [paid access in local currency](../production/monetization/paid-access-local-currency.md). There are two main methods of
[monetizing](../production/monetization/index.md) within an experience:

- [Developer Products](../production/monetization/developer-products.md) - users can purchase
  multiple times. Great for in-experience currency purchases.

- [Passes](../production/monetization/passes.md) - users can only purchase once.
  Great for VIP passes or permanent power-ups.

Both are sold for Robux at a price you choose. You can then trade Robux for real
world currency using the **Developer Exchange**.

## Localization

Roblox players come from around the world and speak a variety of languages. It's
important to [localize](../production/localization/index.md) the experience so everyone can
understand and enjoy it.

Roblox automatically captures text from an experience and stores it in a table
for translation in the experience's **Localization** page, where all localization settings can be configured.

## Promotion

You can promote your experience within the Roblox Ecosystem in multiple ways:

- Use the [Ads Manager](../production/promotion/ads-manager.md#sponsored-experiences) to create ad campaigns using image, video, or portal ads within existing experiences.
- Roblox [experience events](../production/promotion/experience-events.md) are time-based events that users can join and discover through an events detail page.
- You can use integrated features such as [update announcements](../production/promotion/experience-events.md#announce-updates) and [experience notifications](../production/promotion/experience-notifications.md) to promote your content to a wider audience and keep in touch with your existing user base.

## Analytics

Roblox offers a variety of [analytics](../production/analytics/index.md) features to help you chart your experience's growth, track user behavior and retention, and find
opportunities for optimization.
