description: An overview of topics to consider once you finish creating your experience.
---

Once you have created your experience, you may want to find an audience for it
and keep them engaged over time. You need to consider:

- **Publishing** to make it public for everyone to enjoy.

- **Promotion** to bring in new users.

- **Monetization** strategies for selling any products within it.

- **Localization** to help users around the world understand it.

- **Analytics** to monitor how it's performing.

- **Game Design** to create and maintain an engaging player experience.

## Publishing

When an experience is ready to play, you can [publish](../production/publishing/index.md) your
experience on any devices you choose. An experience can be published **privately** (default) in order to test and save to the cloud, or **publicly** so that it can be discovered and played by other users.

## Monetization

Users can spend Robux in experiences for items such as new vehicles or
power-ups, and creators can also earn Robux from [engagement-based payouts](../production/monetization/engagement-based-payouts.md), [private servers](../production/monetization/private-servers.md) and [paid access](../production/monetization/paid-access.md). There are two main methods of
[monetizing](../production/monetization/index.md) within an experience:

- [Developer Products](../production/monetization/developer-products.md) - users can purchase
  multiple times. Great for in-experience currency purchases.

- [Passes](../production/monetization/game-passes.md) - users can only purchase once.
  Great for VIP passes or permanent power-ups.

Both are sold for Robux at a price you choose. You can then trade Robux for real
world currency using the **Developer Exchange**.

## Localization

Roblox players come from around the world and speak a variety of languages. It's
important to [localize](../production/localization/index.md) the experience so everyone can
understand and enjoy it.

Roblox automatically captures text from an experience and stores it in a table
for translation in the experience's **Localization** page, where all localization settings can be configured.

## Promotion

There are two common ways to [promote](../production/promotion/index.md) a Roblox experience
within the Roblox ecosystem.

- The [Advertising System](../production/promotion/user-advertisements.md) lets you spend
  Robux to create different types of adverts which will be displayed on the
  Roblox website for players to click on.

- The [Sponsor System](../production/promotion/sponsoring-experiences.md) displays your
  experience on the Roblox experience page in dedicated sponsor slots alongside
  some of the most popular experiences on the platform. The more Robux spent on
  adverts and sponsors, the more impressions and clicks they will receive.

## Analytics

Roblox offers a variety of [analytics](../production/analytics/index.md) features to help you chart your experience's growth, track user behavior and retention, and find
opportunities for optimization.

## Game Design

The Roblox Game Insights team provides [game design](../production/game-design/index.md) resources for designers of all levels to expand their knowledge and skills.
