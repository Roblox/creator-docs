[Talent Hub](https://talent.roblox.com) is a great place for creators to connect and collaborate. Whether you're looking for someone with a special skill set or want the chance to showcase your own, this is the spot for you.
We want to make sure your experience on Talent Hub is as rewarding and safe as it can be. With that in mind, we've put together a few guidelines to help you foster productive relationships and avoid some potential issues. These guidelines are in addition to the specific [Talent Hub rules](https://talent.roblox.com/consent).

## Verifying a Creator's Credentials

You may notice that some users have a verified badge next to their username on Talent Hub. This lets you know that Roblox reasonably believes those users are real and they are who they say they are.

Verified or not, you should talk with any potential collaborators before committing to working with them. By discussing their previous projects and skills, you can more clearly assess how much experience they actually have and make sure any information they've shared on their profile is accurate. Roblox makes no representation or warranty as to the quality of work of a verified collaborator. Roblox is also not a party to any agreement you may enter into and is not responsible in the event you may not be paid for work you may have undertaken or if you posted a job and the person you agreed to collaborate with did not complete the work.

Creators can add links to other accounts on their Creator Page, including Roblox, DevForum, and their social media. Viewing these accounts to see how active they are and how they interact with others can help you determine whether you want to collaborate with them.

Creators will most likely claim they've done previous work when showing that they'd be a good person to collaborate with. You can verify their work by looking to see if their Roblox account is involved in the experiences they say they've made. You can also reach out to previous collaborators they've worked with on DevForum (or elsewhere) and ask about their experiences working with the creator.

## Setting Up a Safe and Productive Partnership

You are responsible for setting up any agreements you may enter into on Talent Hub. However, an important thing you may want to keep in mind as you start collaborating with a Creator is that neither party should deliver all the work before receiving compensation or pay all compensation upfront before any work is done. Doing so could open the possibility that someone disappears without paying for or completing the contracted work. Instead, you should consider that it should generally be established between both parties that partial compensation be made before work begins, with the remaining amount paid once the work has been delivered. This may change depending on the kind of collaboration you're starting, but setting these expectations (and sticking to them once agreed upon) is a good idea for both parties.

Roblox is not able to provide any legal advice for users of our Talent Hub platform. If you intend to enter into any contractual engagements, please confer with your attorney before executing any agreements. Roblox encourages all creators and users to consult legal counsel at their own expense to understand the risks involved with entering into a contractual agreement. Also, if you are a minor in the jurisdiction where you reside, please have your parent or guardian assist you with entering into any agreements you may enter into on Talent Hub.

By thinking about these guidelines when starting to collaborate with others, you can help ensure that you, your work, and your Robux are kept safe.
