Roblox offers a variety of analytics features to help you chart your experience's growth, track user behavior and retention, and find opportunities for optimization. You can use analytics to understand what actions you can take to grow your experience.

Analytics provide a high level overview of your experience's health and surface optimization opportunities. The highest level of analytics you can use to uncover these opportunities are called _key performance indicators_ (KPIs). Three of the most prominent KPIs are:

- Engagement metrics
- Retention metrics
- Monetization metrics

For an in-depth look at all the analytics features Roblox offers to help you improve you experience, see [Analytics](../../production/analytics/index.md).

## Engagement Metrics

Engagement metrics reveal how often and for how long players are interacting with your experience. Three of the most important engagement metrics are:

- **Daily active users (DAU):** The daily active users metric tracks the number of players that are in your experience for a given day. This is a great way to understand the overall health of your experience over time. If you have 1,000,000 players one day, and a few days later you see a downtrend to 500,000, you can identify a problem and begin troubleshooting.

- **Monthly active users (MAU):** The monthly active users metrics tracks the number of players that are in your experience for a given month. This metric shows month over month trend and can be used to compare user activity on larger time frames. For example, some months have increased player traffic due to seasonal events and holidays. If your monthly active user number is lower last October compared to this October, it could provide insight that your halloween event didn't satisfy your community.

- **Average session length:** The average session length is how long a player plays your experience on average from the start of their session to the time they log out. This metric helps you design content to fit within that window of time to ensure your experience can be enjoyed by the majority of your players. The average session length also serves as a health metric. If the average session length fluctuates after a significant update or seasonal event, it can inform you how your latest content was received.

## Retention Metrics

Retention metrics determine if players are returning to your experience. Three of the most important retention metrics are:

- **Day 1 (D1) retention:** Day 1 retention measures how many players return to your experience on your second day (D1) from the first day they play your experience (D0). A low D1 is indicative of low retention, often as a result of a poor user onboarding experience. This usually means the player is confused or frustrated, or they're not getting to the fun fast enough. To learn more about how to design an effective onboarding experience, see [Onboarding](../../production/game-design/onboarding.md).

- **Day 7 (D7) retention:** D7 retention tracks the amount of players who return to your experience after 7 days. If this number is low, it's often indicative of a poor progression system, with players not having a tangible reason to see themselves playing your experience a week from when they started.

- **Day 30 (D30) retention:** D30 retention tracks the amount of players who return to your experience after 30 days. If this number is low, it's often indicative of a lack of end-game content or lack of an end-game goal. Consider if you have enough content at the end of your experience for seasoned players, be it quests, social aspects, or narrative elements.

## Monetization Metrics

Monetization metrics indicate much revenue your experience is generating. Three of the most important monetization metrics are:

- **Average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU):** ARPDAU is the average amount that players spend in your experience. This is a good snapshot of overall health of the experience. Consider if there are successful systems in your experience that encourage your players to spend.
- **Conversion rate:** The conversion rate is considered one of the most important metrics. The conversion rate is the percentage of all users who have spent any amount of money at all in your experience. The reason why this is one of the most important metrics is that if a player makes an initial purchase, they are much more likely to make a purchase again in the future. Consider if your monetization practices encourage your players to spend.
- **Average revenue per paying user (ARPPU):** The ARPPU metric tracks the total amount spent for all players in your experience, known as _spend depth_. This tells you if players in your experience are motivated to spend a lot, a little, or somewhere in between. If this number is low, it's often indicative of purchase item value's not being correctly optimized.

To learn how to design systems that increase all of these metrics and encourage players to spend money in your experience, see [Monetization Foundations](../../production/game-design/monetization-foundations.md).
