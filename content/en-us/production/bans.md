description: The Creator Hub Bans dashboard lets you ban users and manage bans.

The **Bans** dashboard lets you view current bans, ban users, and unban users. You can view both public and private reasons for each ban, expiration dates for non-permanent bans, and ban history for the user.

![Overview of the Bans dashboard.](../assets/analytics/bans/bans-overview.png)

## Access the dashboard

To access the Bans page, you must either be the experience owner or have [Configure bans for all group experiences permissions](../projects/groups.md#roles-and-permissions).

1. Navigate to your [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) page on **Creator Dashboard** and select your experience.
1. In the **Moderation** menu on the left, select **Bans**.

## Ban users

To ban a user, select the **Add users** button, fill out the details, and click **Apply Ban**.

- You must have the numeric user ID for each user you want to ban. To ban multiple users, include a comma-separated list of IDs.
- **Apply ban to all known alt accounts** lets you also include alt (alternate) accounts.
- Include a public and private reason for the ban. These fields can be identical. Roblox displays the public reason for the ban to the user if they attempt to join your experience.
- For guidelines on banning users, see [Users and players](../players/index.md#ban-guidelines).

## View bans

The default dashboard view shows current bans. You can sort by date of the ban and search for a particular user ID.

Under the **More** column, choose **See ban history** to view history for the user. When choosing whether to unban a user, this information can help you decide if the user was a one-time problem or persistently breaks the rules.

## Unban users

To unban users, choose one or more and click **Unban users**. Unbanned users can immediately access your experience again. Manually unbanning a user does **not** remove their ban history.
