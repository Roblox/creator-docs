It's important to constantly test your models during and after the creation process to ensure that your character can interact with various social and environmental elements in any experience.

Whether you are using a template character, or your own custom assets, use the information provided in [Test in Blender](../../../art/characters/testing/blender.md) and [Test in Studio](../../../art/characters/testing/studio.md) throughout your workflow to comprehensively test your assets and quality check your models.

Use the following table as an overview of common tests and resources to verify each component of your character model.
