title: Using Heads in Studio
description: If you have a model with a live head, you can import the model into Studio, equip face accessories, and create and save animations.
---

You can import character models with animatable heads into Studio and use the automatically generated `Class.FaceControls` instance to pose or animate the face.

To set up heads with facial animation in your experience:

1. [Import a model with an animatable head](#importing-heads). You can either create your own or use one of the provided reference model files.
2. (Optional) [Import face accessories](#importing-face-accessories) you want to deform with the facial expressions of your head. You can either create your own or use one of the provided reference accessory files.
3. [Animate the head](#animating-heads) in the Animation Editor by either adding in individual animation tracks, or by using the Face Animation Editor.

If you want to experiment with pre-made heads before [making your own](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/creating-basic-heads.md), Roblox has a reference experience you can access to see how heads interact with Studio's interface, as well as two reference models and accessories you can import directly into your own experience:

## Importing Heads

You can import any model with a head from a `.fbx` file into Studio. If you would like to include face accessories such as a beard or mustache, you must import and equip the face accessories separately.

<Alert severity="warning">
At this time, use the **Avatar Importer** for importing models with facial animation data.
</Alert>

To import a head into your experience:

1. In the menu bar, navigate to the **Plugins** tab and click **Avatar Importer**.

2. Select the type of avatar you want to import to use your head. If you're unsure, select **Rthro**. A file browser displays.

   <img src="../../../assets/avatar/dynamic-heads/using-dynamic-heads-in-studio/Avatar-Importer-Picker-Rthro.jpg" width="70%" />

3. Select your head **.fbx** file, then click the **Open** button. A popup warning displays with a warning that you may not be importing an Rthro character.

   <img src="../../../assets/avatar/dynamic-heads/using-dynamic-heads-in-studio/Importing-Popup.png" width="70%" />

4. Select **Continue as Rthro**. The character displays in your workspace, and the [Output window](../../../studio/output.md) prints all upload details.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   If you are importing your own head model and an error or warning message displays in the Output window, see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for guidance on how to handle your specific error or warning message.
   </Alert>

## Importing Face Accessories

You can import and equip face accessories that you want to deform with the facial expressions of your head. For example, when you import and equip eyebrows as a face accessory, you can animate the eyebrows to move with the character's eyes.

By default, when you import a face accessory, it imports as a `Class.MeshPart` object. Using the [Accessory Fitting Tool](../../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md), you can convert the `Class.MeshPart` into an `Class.Accessory` instance that is compatible with the head.

To import a face accessory:

1. In the Avatar tab, use the [3D Importer](../../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) to import the custom model into the workspace.

   <img src="../../../assets/avatar/dynamic-heads/using-dynamic-heads-in-studio/Importing-Facial-Accessory-Final-Result.jpg" width="80%" />

2. Using the [Accessory Fitting Tool](../../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md), convert the `Class.MeshPart` into an `Class.Accessory` instance.

   1. In the **Avatar** tab, click on the **Accessory Fitting Tool**. The **Accessory Fitting Tool** window displays.
   2. In the **Explorer** window, select the **MeshPart** you imported as a face accessory. Its name displays in the **Part** field.
   3. Click the **Next** button.
   4. In the **Clothing** category, select **Face**, then click the **Next** button.
   5. (Optional) In the **Edit** panel, use the adjustment options to ensure the accessory fits your model.
   6. In the **Preview** panel, preview the new facial accessory on your head, then click the **Next** button. The tool transforms the `Class.MeshPart` into an `Class.Accessory` instance, and it displays in the **Explorer** window.

You can preview the accessory on your imported model by making the `Class.Accessory` instance a child of your character `Class.Model`. You can only equip character-specific face accessories with their designed character.

  </figure>
</GridContainer>

You can also save the `Class.Accessory` instance to your toolbox and use the asset ID at any time in your experiences. For information on equipping accessories by applying a `Class.HumanoidDescription`, see [Customizing Characters with Humanoid Description](../../../characters/appearance.md#setting-multiple-accessories).

### Accessory Skinning

You can enable the `Class.WrapLayer.AutoSkin` property in the accessory's `Class.WrapLayer` instance to apply the skinning of the head to the face accessory. This allows a face accessory to fit and follow a character's expressions without having to apply any skinning influences to it during the 3D modeling process.

The following options are available for the `Class.WrapLayer.AutoSkin` property:

- **Disabled**: Disables the Automatic Skinning Transfer process. This is the default value.
- **EnabledOverride**: Enables the Auto-Skin Transfer process and allows Studio to override any existing skinning information found on the accessory. Choose this setting when you want to set or replace the existing skinning of an accessory using the Auto-Skin Transfer version.
- **EnabledPreserve**: Enables the Automatic Skinning Transfer process but **doesn't** allow it to override any existing skinning information found on the accessory. Choose this setting when you want to preserve and maintain any existing skinning of an accessory. If there isn't any skinning to maintain, the Auto-Skin Transfer creates new skinning automatically.

## Animating Heads

Animatable head `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts` include a `Class.FaceControls` instance which allows you to access your facial pose properties.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">

  </figure>
</GridContainer>

You can adjust these properties in the Animation Editor to animate your head. For more information, see [Animating Heads](../../../art/characters/facial-animation/animating-heads.md).

## Troubleshooting

When importing custom head models, the [Output window](../../../studio/output.md) displays an error or warning message if there were any issues during the configuration process.

### Error Messages

Error messages indicate a failure to properly import a model with a head. Reference the following table for a summary of all head error messages and troubleshooting tips:

      <th>Error Message</th>
      <th>Troubleshooting</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>You have corrective X, but missing corrective Y to support it.  This may cause odd deformations.</td>
      <td>You set a 3-corrective without setting the base 2-corrective.  The imported head will animate, but there might be strange deformations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Control X is nearly identical to Neutral.</td>
      <td>The pose for X is very similar to Neutral.  Studio reports this in case this was a mistake, but the import will be successful as long as there are no other failures.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Found only N base poses. Your character may not be able to express itself.</td>
      <td>You only defined a subset of base poses in the <kbd>.fbx</kbd> file.  The import will still be successful as long as there are no other failures.</td>
