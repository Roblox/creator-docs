title: Importing Character Bodies
description: Use the 3D Importer to add third-party models to Studio before testing, using, or uploading the character model.
---

Use the following instructions to import a full character body model into Studio as a `Model` object that you can save to use in your experience, share with others, or upload to the Marketplace.

<Alert severity ='info'>
If you are using a single-mesh character body for the Roblox Auto-Setup tool, see [Avatar Auto-Setup](../modeling/avatar-setup.md#avatar-auto-setup).
</Alert>

Studio's 3D Importer provides a quick and easy way to import third-party 3D assets into your projects. The importer provides object previews and error-checking to ensure that your asset meets Roblox's [general 3D requirements](../modeling/specifications.md).

Keep in mind, your character model must also follow Roblox's [Avatar Character Specifications](../characters/specifications.md) to use or sell this asset as an avatar-ready character model, or you may experience errors later in the workflow.

To import your asset:

1. In Studio, navigate to the **Avatar tab** and select the **3D Importer**.
2. In the file browser, select the `.fbx` or `.gltf` file saved locally. The 3D Importer loads a preview of the object.

   - If textures don't load for your asset, you can manually import your textures later.
   - See [3D Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) for additional information on import settings and troubleshooting.

3. To begin body validation after import, enable **Validate UGC Body**. This can save you time if you intend on uploading your body to the Marketplace.
4. Set the **Rig Scale** to the appropriate [Body Scale](../characters/specifications.md#body-scale) of your character.

5. Select **Import**. The asset populates in your workspace as a `Class.Model` with the appropriate textures applied as a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` or `Class.MeshPart.TextureID`.

 If textures didn't load correctly, add them manually. You may need to save and publish your experience in order to access the [Asset Manager](../../projects/assets/manager.md).

1.  Open the Asset Manager. You may need to save and publish your experience before accessing your assets.
2.  In the Asset Manager, and select the **Bulk Import** button.

3.  Upload your image files.
4.  After moderation clears for your image, select the `Class.MeshPart` parented within your imported `Class.Model`.
5.  If you are using a single basic texture, set the `Class.MeshPart.TextureID` property to your uploaded texture image.
6.  If you are using PBR Textures:

    1. Add a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` child to your `Class.MeshPart`.

       <img src="../../assets/art/avatar/Avatar-Surface-Appearance.png" />

    2. In the `Class.SurfaceAppearance` properties, click each property value and assign the appropriate texture image from the asset dropdown:

       1. Set the **ColorMap** to the **\_ALB** texture image.
       2. Set the **MetalnessMap** to the **\_MTL** texture image.
       3. Set the **NormalMap** to the **\_NOR** texture image.
       4. Set the **RoughnessMap** to the **\_RGH** texture image.

<Alert severity = 'success'>
After successful import, your model object should populate in your project as a `Class.Model` with the appropriate textures applied.
</Alert>

After successful fitting and converting, your 3D model should populate in your project as an `Class.Model`.

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
Character creation is a complex process that requires lots of testing and iteration. See [Testing Characters](../../art/characters/testing/index.md) for steps on importing your character model into a test place and verifying your avatar and related components.
</Alert>

With this new character `Class.Model`, you can perform any of the following:

- Begin the process of [uploading and publishing](../../art/marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md#uploading-an-asset) the character model to the Marketplace. This involves some additional validation and moderation steps.

- Use the model in your current experience and modify the model's appearance with [HumanoidDescription](../../characters/appearance.md#humanoiddescription).

  - Playtest as the character by renaming the `Class.Model` to `StarterCharacter` and moving the `Class.Model` to the StarterPlayer folder in your Explorer before play testing.

- Save the model to your [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md) or make it public on the [Creator Store](../../production/publishing/creator-store.md) to share or use within any of your experiences.
