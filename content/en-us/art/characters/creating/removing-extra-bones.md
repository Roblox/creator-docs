title: Removing Extra Bones
description: When creating characters in Blender, you must remove the extra head bones included in the template.

The helper bones used to help place the head geometries also require removal to validate correctly. While these extra bones do not include any skinning data, do not delete any of the facial animation bones parented within DynamicHead, as these include important skinning data that drives facial animation.

<Alert severity = 'error'>
Failure to [combine head geometry](../../characters/creating/combining-head-geometry.md) and remove head bones will cause issues with validation, as the character will no longer adhere to the expected R15 geometry and joint hierarchy.
</Alert>

Remove the additional head bones by selecting them and deleting them in edit mode:

1. If required, toggle visibility on your **Armature** object. The bones display in the viewport.
2. In the Outliner, expand the character's armature object and find the **Joints** object that parents the bone structure of the character.

3. Expand the Joints hierarchy by holding **shift** and clicking the expansion dropdown.
4. In the viewport, select any bone and switch to **Edit Mode**.

5. Under the Head joint, hold **shift** and select all the head children joints except DynamicHead.
6. With the extra head bones selected, right click in the viewport and select **Delete Selected Bones**.
