Depending on the types of customizations you made to your template project or model, the following are additional tasks to look out for when cleaning up your project:

- Ensure that your project doesn't contain additional mesh objects that aren't part of your character model geometry.
- Verify that there isn't additional animation data, such as additional keyframes or saved poses and orientations that are not related to the original facial animation data.
- Double-check that your geometry, rig, and texture adhere to the [avatar technical specifications](../../../art/characters/specifications.md).
