description: Use the appropriate export settings in Maya and Blender to generate Studio-ready .fbx files.
---

Export your character model as a `.fbx` to take advantage of all of Studio's 3D import features. Your `.fbx` export contains all the rig, skinning, and animation data you need to later [import](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) into Studio.

Check that your model meets Roblox's [avatar character specifications](../../art/characters/specifications.md) before exporting to ensure Studio compatibility.

- If you are creating an accessory model, ensure that your model follows [Accessory Specifications](../../art/accessories/specifications.md).
- If you are creating a generic mesh, ensure that your model follows Roblox's [General Specifications](../../art/modeling/specifications.md).

<Alert severity = 'error'>
If you are using Roblox's avatar template files, you must perform the [cleanup steps](../../art/characters/creating/cleanup.md) in order for the assets to properly validate.

Before exporting a mesh from Blender, make sure either your **Scene Properties** > **Unit Scale** to `.01` or your export **Transform** > **Scale** is set to `.01` (step 4) to ensure similar `.fbx` scaling within Studio.

To export the `.fbx` file in Blender:

1. In the topbar, click **File**. A pop-up menu displays.
2. Select **Export**, then **FBX (.fbx)**. The **Blender File View** window displays.
3. On the right-hand side, change the **Path Mode** property to **Copy**, then toggle the **Embed Textures** button.

4. If your project doesn't already have .01 scene unit scaling, set the **Transform** > **Scale** to `.01`.
