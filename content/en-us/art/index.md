**3D art** in Roblox refers to the creation and integration of models, environments, effects, sounds, and more to create an engaging and immersive experience. 3D artists bring the world, objects, and characters to life with a variety of tools and techniques using Roblox Studio and external applications.

While the roles and workflows of 3D artists often vary by project or organization, some of the common roles of 3D artists in the Roblox ecosystem include:

- **3D modelers** who create custom 3D models of objects, such as characters and props, for use in experiences.
- **Character artists** who create bodies, clothing, and accessories to sell directly on the Roblox Marketplace.
- **Environmental artists** who build out the world of each experience, working with terrain, lighting, architecture, and more.
- **Animators** who create lifelike animation and movements for characters and objects.

No matter your creative background, Roblox provides a variety of tools, guides, tutorials, and reference files to help inspire and level up your 3D art creation in your experiences and beyond.

## Getting Started

Roblox provides many resources for creators of all skill levels. If you are new to Roblox or creating 3D art, use the following resources to get started:

- **For 3D artists of all levels**: Get up to speed on creating with [Getting Started in Studio](./overview-studio.md) and [Getting Started with Third-Party Software](./overview-dcc.md).
- **For creators from other engines** - See Roblox's guides for [Unity](../unity.md) and [Unreal](../unreal.md) developers for a comparison of Studio to other engines.
- **For avatar item creators**: See [Avatar](../avatar/index.md) for an overview of creating and selling avatar cosmetics as well as additional resources and reference guides.

[Resources](#resources) contains quick links to additional common resources, such as 3D modeling specifications, popular tools, and more.

## Showcases

The following are experiences that were created by Roblox or have won showcase awards for their exceptional use of 3D art and visual identity. Many of the Roblox experiences include free-to-use model packs, as well as additional behind-the-scenes content to learn more about the creation process.
