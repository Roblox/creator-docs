<Alert severity = 'warning'>
Only creators participating in the [UGC program](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) can upload items on the Marketplace at this time.
</Alert>

3D accessories and clothing assets you sell on the [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog), such as clothing accessories, must follow specific requirements. Some requirements may require additional configuration on a third-party modeling software, such as Blender or Maya.

If you are ready to sell an item and the item meets the requirements below, see [Publishing Marketplace Items](../../art/marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md) for details on publishing the asset.

## General Guidelines

When designing and creating your assets, follow these guidelines to ensure that your item passes moderation and allows Roblox users to express themselves with safety and civility. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in [moderation](../../art/marketplace/moderation.md) and item removal.

Whether or not you are the original creator of the asset, you must ensure that you have the right to upload the asset and that your item adheres to the following program guidelines:

- Follow the [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards). For instance, do not create items that are political, religious, gory, violent, self-harm-related, drug-related, sexual/wedding/dating-related, or items that are likely to be used for these types of roleplay. These are some examples of items that violate the Community Standards.
- Do not use any Roblox-created assets or official [Roblox branding or iconography](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001708126) as part of your items.
- Do not create items that are overly similar to existing items, such as valuable and limited items. This includes scenarios such as:
  - Creators who have already published an item and re-publish the same item as a Limited item.
  - Creators who publish a Limited item and then re-publish the same Limited item.
  - Creators who copy another creator's item or Roblox's item.
- Only sell items that you have permission to sell. If you are not the original creator or owner of the IP, you must have permission from the IP owner to sell their content or inspired content.
- Be especially careful when submitting items in or near the mouth or waist of the avatar. Make sure to frequently test your assets on multiple types of characters to avoid design issues.
- Do not create items that intentionally disrupt a user's experience, such as:
  - Obscuring the majority of the user's avatar.
  - Obscuring the user's in-experience UI.
  - Obscuring other users' avatars or in-experience view.
  - Making a user's avatar disappear (completely or partially).
- Do not create items that depend on issues or glitches on the Roblox platform.
- Do not include excessive text on items.

## Avatar Body Guidelines

Submissions of avatar bodies to the Marketplace must follow additional policy guidelines, along with the [general guidelines](#general-guidelines) and [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards).

### Body Part Requirements

Each body can only include the following parts, and cannot have additional appendages:

- Body Parts
  - 1 right arm
  - 1 left arm
  - 1 torso
  - 1 right leg
  - 1 left leg
- Heads
  - Head (includes baked-in eyes, nose, and mouth, if applicable)
    - All heads must include the 17 minimum [FACS controls](../../art/characters/facial-animation/facs-poses-reference.md).
    - It's recommended to include more poses to increase facial animation quality and fidelity.
  - Eyebrows (optional)
  - Eyelashes (optional)

Avatars must adhere to the [appropriate size requirements](../../art/characters/specifications.md#body-types) and cannot have any invisible or non-rendering body parts. See [Avatar character specifications](../../art/characters/specifications.md) for more information.

Roblox moderates avatars that do not follow the body part requirements under the [Misusing Roblox Systems Community Standard](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

### Modesty Layers

A _modesty layer_ is a layer of clothing that covers an avatar's upper torso and lower torso. All avatars with skin-like texture in the groin and chest require a modesty layer when applicable.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">

  <center><img src="../../assets/art/avatar/Modesty-Layer-Example-B.png" width = "70%"/></center>
  <figcaption><center>Does not require modesty layer</center></figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

For all modesty layers, the following applies:

- All modesty layers must be fully opaque. While they can include artistic highlights, shadows, or textures, modesty layers that are sheer or partially transparent are not permitted.
- The modesty layer must be a different color from the avatar's skin tone.
- Modesty layers designed to be sexually suggestive, such as lingerie, are not permitted.
- Both upper and lower torso modesty layers are required if your avatar character resembles a minor.

Roblox moderates avatars that do not follow the modesty layers requirements under the [Romantic and Sexual Content Community Standard](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

#### Lower Torso

The **lower torso** modesty layer must provide full coverage from the avatar's hips to the bottom of the groin and buttocks. Lower torso modesty layers can include clothing styles such as briefs, high-waisted underwear, boxers, or boy shorts that fully cover the buttocks.

#### Upper Torso

You must add an **upper torso** modesty layer if your avatar uses a skin-like texture in the chest where the breasts protrude off the chest and have a rounded or oblong shape. Upper torso modesty layers are not required for characters with flat, muscle-shaped pectorals.

For upper torso modesty layers, the following applies:

- For characters that resemble minors, the upper torso modesty layer must provide full coverage of the entire breast and stomach area, such as a tank top.
- For characters that don't resemble minors, the upper torso modesty layer must provide full coverage of the entire breast area.
  - Cleavage can be depicted using outlines but must be completely covered by the modesty layer.
  - Full coverage of the back is not required, but it must be clear that the avatar character is not naked if seen from the back.

  <figcaption><center>Upper torso layers must be clearly visible from the back</center></figcaption>
  </figure>

Upper torso modesty layers can include strapless bras, racerback bras, balconette bras, tube tops, crop tops, or bandeau tops.

### Age Appropriate

Avatar bodies must not be sexually suggestive or depict or suggest nudity in genital areas. This includes depicting pubic hair, genitalia, or nipples. This includes any visible depiction through or around the [modesty layers](#modesty-layers).

Roblox moderates avatars that do not follow the modesty layers requirements under the [Romantic and Sexual Content Community Standard](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

### Accessories and Clothing

Avatar bodies cannot include any accessories or clothing. Accessories are items that you can find separately in the Marketplace that are not part of the body part requirements, such as equipable tails, wings, glasses, clothing, [tattoos](#tattoos), and [makeup](#makeup). You must upload and sell these items separately. Heads can include hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows, but these must also be separate items.

</table>

Roblox moderates avatars with accessories or clothing under the [Misusing Roblox Systems Community Standard](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Rules).

#### Tattoos

Tattoos are drawings, patterns, or shapes that are distinct from the body's texture and differ in color from the rest of the body, You must upload and sell tattoos separately. Avatars can have textures, but not tattoos. Textures are a repeating pattern that looks like a tangible/physical object and covers at least 50% of the avatar. Examples of textures include: scales, feathers, rocks, and fur.

#### Makeup

Avatar heads can use shading and shadowing to show dimension and definition. This includes shading of the eyelids in a tone similar to skin tone, single color lips, eyeliner, eyelashes, and eyebrows, or cheeks shaded to look flushed, rosy, healthy, or warm.

Your avatar head cannot include any additional color, shading, or outlining not solely used to show dimension and definition of the face. You must upload and sell these features separately. This includes facial painting, multicolor eyelashes, eyeliner, and lips, and eyeshadow that goes beyond shading and is not related to the skin tone of the rest of the body.

### Customizable Skin Tones

Roblox recommends including customizable skin tones, or skin tone mutability, for avatars that resemble humans. Skin tone mutability is optional. Similarly, for avatars created through formal brand partnerships, skin tone mutability is optional. For more information on creating customizable skin tone textures, see [Custom Skin Tone](../../art/characters/specifications.md#custom-skin-tone).
