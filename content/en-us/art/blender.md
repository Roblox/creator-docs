## File setup

Before you begin creating 3D art on Blender for the Roblox platform, it's important to configure both Blender and Studio settings so that your 3D objects maintain the same position, orientation, and scale as you iterate and move them between the two applications.

### Configure units

By default, Blender and Studio use different primary units to measure length: Blender defaults to the metric scale, and Studio defaults to [studs](../physics/units.md). To ensure that your 3D objects retain the same measurements when you move or scale them in either application, you must configure Blender's units to be consistent with studs.

To set Blender units to be compatible with Roblox's stud units:

1. Navigate to the **Properties editor**, then in the left-hand navigation, select the **Scene** tab.

   <img src="../assets/art/blender-ui/scene-tab.jpg" width = "40%" alt="Blender's Properties editor with the Scene tab highlighted."/>

1. Click the **Units** dropdown menu to expand the container, then:
   1. Set **Unit System** to **None**.
   1. Set **Rotation** to **Degrees**.

### Import settings

3D software and applications use coordinate systems to represent the position and orientation of objects in the 3D space. These coordinate systems typically consist of three axes:

- One axis represents horizontal position (left and right movement).
- One axis represents vertical position (up and down movement).
- One axis represents depth (forward and backward movement).

Blender and Studio use **different** coordinate systems, specifically for the axis that represents the "up" direction. Like other modeling software, Blender uses the Z axis because 3D objects move up out of the 2D plane to become a 3D object; conversely, like other game engines, Studio uses the Y axis because characters move on the ground plane and jump up for vertical movement.

This difference is important to keep in mind as you import your 3D art into Blender or Studio because you must make adjustments to the import settings to ensure your object maintains the correct orientation in either application.

1. In the bottom right-hand corner, click the **Import** button.

#### Blender to Studio

To set Studio import settings for 3D objects from Blender:

1. Navigate to **File** > **Import 3D**. Your local file browser displays.
1. Select and then confirm the 3D object's `.obj`, `.fbx`, or `.gltf` file(s) you want to import from your local system. The 3D Importer's **Import Preview** window displays.
1. In the right-hand panel, navigate to the **File General** section, then:
   1. Enable **Import Only as a Model** if you have multiple objects that you want to group into a `Class.Model` object.
   1. Enable **Upload to Roblox** if you want to create an asset with an assetID that you can reference across projects.
   1. Set **Creator** to **Me** if you are the only one who needs to access the object, or to the group that owns the project you're working on. This latter setting ensures all eligible group members have permission to use the 3D object within the project.
   1. Enable **Insert Using Scene Position** so that the object retains the position you set in Blender.

   <img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/Studio-Import.png" width = "80%" alt="The Import Preview window with the File General section highlighted."/>

1. Navigate to the **File Transform** section, then set the following settings so that the object retains the same orientation from Blender:
   1. Set **World Forward** to **Front** to keep the same "forward" axis as Blender.
   1. Set **World Up** to **Top** to keep the same "up" axis as Blender.
1. Navigate to the **File Geometry** section, then set **Scale Unit** to **Stud** to keep the same scale from Blender.
1. At the bottom of the window, click the **Import** button. Your 3D object imports with the same scale and orientation from Blender.

### Export settings

Similar to the previous file setup section, it's important to consider Blender and Studio's different coordinate systems when you are ready to export your 3D art from Blender. By taking a little extra time in configuring your export settings, you can ensure your 3D objects maintain the correct orientation, scale, and position when you import them into Studio.

To set Blender settings for exporting 3D objects for Studio:

1. In the top left-hand corner, click the hamburger menu. A popup menu displays.
1. Navigate to **File** > **Export** > **Wavefront (.obj)**, **FBX (.fbx)**, or **glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)**. The **Blender File View** window displays.
1. Select the `.obj`, `.fbx`, or `.gltf` file that you want to export.
1. In the right-hand panel, navigate to the **Include** section, then enable **Limit to Selected Objects** to only export your selected objects.

   <img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/BlenderFileView-Export.png" width = "80%" alt="The Blender File View window with the General section highlighted."/>

1. In the **Transform** section
   1. Set **Scale** to **0.01** so that your object(s) keep the same scale in Studio.
   1. Set **Forward** to **Z Forward** to keep the same "forward" axis as Blender.
   1. Set **Up** to **Y Up** to keep the same "up" axis as Blender.
1. In the bottom right-hand corner, click the **Export** button. Your 3D object is now ready to [import into Studio](#blender-to-studio).

## Fundamentals

Before you take a look at all of the common modeling, sculpting, and texturing tools for making 3D art for Studio, let's review Blender's fundamental interface elements that are important for navigating through the application and finding the appropriate menus and controls for your specific 3D creation task.

### Workspaces

<img src="../assets/art/blender-ui/Workspaces.png" width = "100%" alt="Blender's UI with workspaces highlighted."/>

**Workspaces** are preset window layouts with specialized UI configurations and tooling for different 3D creation work like modeling, sculpting, or texturing. You can use these workspace configurations as-is, or you can customize them to work for you as you quickly swap between different tasks.

<Alert severity="info">
For information on additional workspaces, see Blender's official [Workspaces](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.81/interface/window_system/workspaces.html) documentation.
</Alert>

There are many default workspaces, but the following are the most common for creating 3D art for the Roblox platform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem key = "1" label="Layout">

<img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/Layout_Workspace.png" width = "60%" alt="Blender's Topbar with the Layout workspace highlighted."/>

The **Layout** workspace is the default workspace when you load a Blender file, and it provides basic tools for previewing and transforming your 3D objects, such as the Move, Scale, and Rotate tools. The default layout of this workspace includes the following UI for easy access as you set up your 3D art:

- [3D Viewport](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/3dview/introduction.html) - Displays the entire scene.
- [Outliner](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/outliner/introduction.html) - Displays all objects in the scene, comparable to Studio's Explorer window.
- [Properties Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/properties_editor.html) - Displays editable data for the active object, comparable to Studio's Properties window.
- [Timeline Editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/timeline.html) - Displays all animation keyframes, comparable to the Animation Editor's timeline.

</TabItem>
<TabItem key = "2" label="Modeling">

<img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/Modeling_Workspace.png" width = "60%" alt="Blender's Topbar with the Modeling workspace highlighted."/>

The **Modeling** workspace is very similar to the Layout workspace, but it offers more space for the 3D Viewport so that you can focus on modifying the geometry of your 3D objects. If you swap between the Modeling and Layout workspaces, you can see the Properties Editor expand, the Outliner shrink in size, and the Timeline Editor disappear altogether.

The default layout of this workspace includes the following UI for modeling your 3D art:

- [3D Viewport](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/3dview/introduction.html) - Displays the entire scene.

1. Set **Axis** to **X**, **Y**, and/or **Z** to mirror along one or many axes.
1. In **Edit** mode, modify your object or any of its mesh elements to see your modifications mirror along an axis or multiple axes.

## Texturing tools

After you finish modeling your 3D object, it's time to apply a texture to your mesh so that it has additional visual characteristics, such as color, depth, and roughness through a [texture map](../art/modeling/surface-appearance.md). These are details that modeling alone can't provide, transforming your object from a blank shape to something that looks either realistic or stylized according to your experience's art requirements.

Each of the following sections details how you can use each tool for either UV editing or vertex painting objects, the hotkeys you can use to activate the tool, and their most common use cases for texturing 3D art for the Roblox platform.

### UV editing

UV editing is the process of unwrapping your 3D object's faces and mapping them onto a 2D image texture. This process allows you to use a single texture to apply visual characteristics to multiple objects in Blender, saving you a negative impact on memory in Studio. For example, the following door frame, ceiling, and card reader meshes in the [Laser Tag](../resources/templates.md#laser-tag) template all use the same UV map to add metal adornments.

<GridContainer numColumns="3">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/tutorials/environmental-art-curriculum/Section2/TrimSheets-Doorway.jpg" alt="An doorway with trim sheet textures applied." width="100%"/>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/tutorials/environmental-art-curriculum/Section2/TrimSheets-Ceiling.jpg" alt="A group of ceiling tiles with trim sheet textures applied." width="100%"/>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/tutorials/environmental-art-curriculum/Section2/TrimSheets-Reader.jpg" alt="A futuristic card reader with trim sheet textures applied." width="100%"/>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

The "UV" in UV editing stands for the axes on the 2D image map that you use during the mapping process:

- U axis - The horizontal position (left and right movement).
- V axis - The vertical position (up and down movement).

Because 3D objects use the X, Y, and Z axes in the 3D space, 3D creation applications typically use U and V to avoid confusion when referring to coordinates in 2D image space. That being said, many Blender UI workflows still use X and Y, so it's helpful to know the 2D space equivalent axis.

When you unwrap a 3D object, all active faces flatten into the 2D space in the UV Editor to make up the **UV map**, and different sections of the model split into separate groupings, commonly referred to as **UV islands**. For example, if you were to unwrap a standard Blender cube, each face would become its own UV island in the UV map.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/CubeMap.png" alt="A UV map of a 3D cube." width="60%"/>
    <figcaption>UV map in the UV Editor</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/UV-Cube.png" alt="The 3D cube that is being unwrapped." width="60%"/>
    <figcaption>Cube in the 3D Viewport</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

Every point, line, and face in the UV map corresponds to a vertex, edge, and face in the mesh. This means that when you move UV islands to different parts of the texture, their corresponding vertices, edges, and faces update to reflect the area of the texture that they now overlap.

Blender often creates UV islands along **seams**, or connected edges, to minimize distortion and make it easier for you to apply your texture. While this default UV island configuration is a great place to start, it's almost always necessary to modify each island's position, orientation, and scale to overlap the area of the texture you want to project, or mark your own seams to focus on texturing specific areas at a time.

By investing the time to unwrap, arrange, and map your UV islands, you can improve your texture quality and reduce stretching or distortion on all of your 3D art. The following subsections highlight the most common tools for this process, specifically in regards to unwrapping and mapping your objects.

<Alert severity="info">

#### Mark Seam

The **Mark Seam** tool lets you manually break up a 3D object's UV map into smaller, manageable sections. While this step in the unwrapping process is technically optional, many Roblox creators find it useful for concentrating on collections of related faces for complex objects that require a lot of detailed texture work.

For example, the following rivet gun requires a metal texture for the barrel, and a leather texture for the grip. To make it easier to texture this object, you can mark the seams of the grip, unwrap just the faces between those seams, then map it to a leather texture image.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">

    <figcaption>Marked seams in the 3D Viewport</figcaption>
  </figure>
</GridContainer>

To use the Mark Seam tool:

1. Open the **UV Editing** workspace. The UV Editor displays on the lefthand side of the screen, and the 3D viewport displays on the righthand side of the screen in Edit mode.
1. In the **3D Viewport**, navigate to your 3D object, then select the edges where you want to create seams.
1. Press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> hotkey to open the **Edge** contextual menu.
1. Select **Mark Seam**. The seam turns red and is ready for the Unwrap tool.

When you are ready to unwrap your object, Blender will unwrap the enclosed faces of the seam as its own island.

#### Unwrap

The **Unwrap** tool lets you unwrap and clean up the UV map of any marked seams or active faces of a 3D object so that you have a solid foundation of UV islands to work with. This can quickly take UV coordinates from being a complete mess to something more manageable.

Many Roblox creators use this tool for complex shapes that they need full control over when applying textures, such as characters, clothes, and curvy objects, because it works quickly and avoids stretching and distortion.

#### Follow Active Quads

The **Follow Active Quads** tool lets you generate clean and organized UV islands according to the UV coordinates of a previously unwrapped active face. This is particularly useful for grid-like topology, such as when you're unwrapping walls, floors, or mechanical parts using trim sheets.

Many Roblox creators use this tool to apply a consistent texture to curved 3D objects, such as sidewalks for experiences or belts for accessories.

<video controls src="../assets/art/3p-software/blender/FollowActiveQuads.mp4" width="80%"></video>

To use the Follow Active Quads tool:

1. Open the **UV Editing** workspace. The UV Editor displays on the lefthand side of the screen, and the 3D viewport displays on the righthand side of the screen in Edit mode.
1. In the **3D Viewport**, navigate to your 3D object, then unwrap every face you want to texture using an active face.
1. **(Optional)** Configure your active face.
   1. In the **UV Editor**, select the face you want to be your active face, then press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> hotkey to open the **Split** contextual menu.
   1. Select **Selection**. The active face separates from the UV island.
   1. Move, scale, or rotate your active face to the appropriate position, orientation, and scale that you want other faces in the UV map to follow.
1. In the **UV Editor**, select all faces you want to follow the active face. Make sure to select your active face last so that Blender knows to use its layout as the guide.
1. Press the <kbd>U</kbd> hotkey to open the **Unwrap** contextual menu, then select **Follow Active Quads**. Blender aligns your selection's UV coordinates to match the active face's shape and orientation.

#### Projection

Projection tools are tools that project a 3D object's surface onto the 2D image texture plane. Each projection tool controls how the object's shape unwraps and maps onto the 2D texture:

- **Cube Projection** - Projects the object's faces onto all six sides of a cube; useful for boxy shapes like crates.
- **Sphere Projection** - Projects the object's surface onto a sphere; useful for round shapes like eyes.
- **Cylinder Projection** - Projects the object onto a cylindrical shape; useful for tubes, pipes, and limbs.
- **Project from View** - Projects the object's selected faces according to the current camera or viewport angle; useful for flat surfaces and decals.
- **Smart UV Project** - Automatically unwraps the model and generates islands according to a set angle between faces.

It's useful to consider how you can utilize projection tools to save time in the texturing process, especially for simple objects that require repetitive textures. For example, many Roblox creators strategically use these tools to efficiently create UV islands for basic geometric shapes without needing to mark seams from edges.

### Vertex painting

Vertex painting is the process of storing color information directly on the vertices of your 3D object rather than through traditional textures or materials. In this approach, each vertex holds color data that Blender interpolates across the faces of a mesh, creating either smooth gradients or solid blocks of color without the need for UV mapping or image textures.

Vertex painting is useful for adding color variation to your assets in a lightweight, efficient way, especially in stylized workflows or experiences where performance is a concern, as it can reduce texture memory usage and draw calls. Many Roblox creators use vertex painting in conjunction with Studio's default materials, `Class.MaterialVariant` objects, and `Class.SurfaceAppearance` objects to create visual complexity on otherwise simple 3D objects.
