description: Classic clothing are decals you can apply to a classic character model's surface. You can create classic clothing items on Roblox and upload them to the Marketplace.

<Alert severity="warning">
Current user-generated avatars on the Marketplace do not support 2D classic clothing. For information on creating modern 3D cosmetics, including rigid accessories and clothing items, see [Get started](../avatar/index.md).
</Alert>

To ensure the best quality results, you can test your classic clothing before uploading or selling. You can test your clothes without needing to pay any fees by using [Roblox Studio](../studio/setup.md).

1. In Studio, open the [Avatar](../studio/avatar-tab.md) tab and click **Rig Builder**.
