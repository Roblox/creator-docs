After creating the clothing item in your third-party modeling tool, import the `.fbx` using Studio's 3D Importer tool to add the object to your project as a `Class.Model`.

Use the 3D Importer to import your `.fbx` into Studio:

1. Open Studio and navigate to the **Avatar** tab.
2. Click the **Import 3D** button. A file browser displays.
3. Select your exported `.fbx` and verify any possible warnings or errors.
   1. Warnings or errors related to the clothing mesh may require returning to Blender to resolve.
4. Select **Import** to add the model to your workspace.
