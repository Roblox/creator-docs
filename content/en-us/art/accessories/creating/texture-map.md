Creating seams and unwrapping tells Blender how to project the 3D surface of the clothing item in 2D. Before you can apply any texture appearance changes, you need to create a texture map, which is the specific 2D image you apply and save your textures to.

To create a new texture map:

1. With the clothing mesh selected, navigate to the **Properties** panel > **Material Preview** tab.
   <img src="../../../assets/art/accessories/creating/Texturing-Add-Image.png" width="40%" />

2. Select the **+ New** button.
3. Next to Base Color, select the **yellow dot** and click **Image Texture**.
   <img src="../../../assets/art/accessories/creating/Texturing-Add-Base.png" width="80%" />
4. Click the **+ New** button.

   1. Name the texture image the same as your clothing mesh with a `_TXT` affix.
   2. Set the color to black, or any base color of your preference.
   3. Keep the rest of the default settings.
   4. Press **OK** when completed.
