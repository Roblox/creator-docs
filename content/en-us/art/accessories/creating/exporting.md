It's important to follow the Blender export settings to ensure a Studio-compatible `.fbx` file. Before exporting your file, ensure that you've removed extra objects, such as lights, cameras, or mannequins, and applied or removed any active modifiers.

To export your file from Blender:

1. In the topbar, click **File**. A pop-up menu displays.
2. Select **Export**, then **FBX (.fbx)**. The **Blender File View** window displays.
3. On the right-hand side, change the **Path Mode** property to **Copy**, then toggle the **Embed Textures** button.

4. If your project doesn't have .01 scene unit scaling, set the **Transform** > **Scale** to `.01`.

5. Under the **Armature** section, disable **Add Leaf Bones**.
