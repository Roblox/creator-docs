With the clothing mesh parented to an armature, you can now perform quick tests to verify that your clothing deforms correctly.

<Alert severity ='warning'>
If you see issues with the deformation of your clothing, you may need to correct the issue with weight-painting, a technique for manually applying skinning data to your meshes.

This tutorial doesn't cover the process of weight-painting. For additional resources on manually weight painting and instructions on updating skinning data on meshes, see the following resources:

- [Skinning a Simple Mesh](../../modeling/skinning-a-simple-mesh.md)
- [Skinning a Humanoid Mesh](../../modeling/skinning-a-humanoid-model.md)

</Alert>

To test your clothing's movement:

1. With your armature selected, navigate to the **Properties panel** > **Armature properties**.
2. In **Viewport Display** > **Show**, enable **In Front**. The **In Front** property enables you to easily see and access the bones for posing.

3. In the viewport, select your armature and navigate to **Pose** mode.
4. Click on various bones and press <kbd>R</kbd> to rotate and set a pose. After pressing <kbd>R</kbd>:

   1. Click to save the rotation.
   2. Right-click to cancel an unsaved rotation.
   3. If you have saved a rotation, reset your pose in the viewport with right-click and select **Clear User Transforms**.

5. Try various natural poses of your character to ensure that your clothing stretches and fits correctly.
