title: Making Mesh Watertight
description: Seal off your geometry to ensure that there are no angles where the interior backfaces of your object are exposed.

With the shirt shape finalized, make your mesh **watertight** by "sealing" the holes at the neck, waist, and wrist. A watertight shape ensures that only the top visible surface of the mesh is exposed at any angle. If an asset is not watertight, it may expose backfaces, or single sided faces, that could affect the rendering of your asset and performance when equipped.

To make your mesh watertight:

1. Select your mesh and switch to **Edit Mode**.
2. Starting with any hole in the mesh, hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> and click the **last edge** on the mesh. The entire edge highlights.
3. Press <kbd>E</kbd> to extrude the mesh and click after a small length is added.
4. With the new edge still selected, right-click and select **Merge Vertices** > **At Center**.
5. Press <kbd>G</kbd> to grab the new vertex and reposition it within your clothing mesh.
6. **Repeat steps 2-5** until all the interior-exposing holes of your mesh are closed.

There are a lot of techniques to create clothing. Try experimenting with the following techniques, tools, and processes to create additional unique assets:

- Making asymmetrical clothing.
- Blender's [cloth simulation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/physics/cloth/examples.html#using-simulation-to-shape-sculpt-a-mesh) and other sculpting tools.
- Various community sewing and fabric techniques for creating clothing on Blender.
