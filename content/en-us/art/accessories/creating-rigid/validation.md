After generating your `Class.Accessory` item, you can now begin the process of **publishing** the asset to the Marketplace. This step is optional and only applicable for creators who intend to sell their asset. At this time, only participants of the UGC Program can publish assets to the Marketplace.

The publishing process involves three major steps:

1. **Validation** - Validation occurs locally at the start of the upload process. This ensures that the accessory meets all of the technical requirements before uploading.
2. **Moderation** - After uploading, Studio sends the asset to the Moderation queue. Moderation typically completes within 24 hours.
3. **Ready-for-sale** - Once the asset clears moderation, you can set your marketplace settings and enable the asset for sale.

If you intend to sell the asset on the Marketplace, use the following steps to begin the validation and upload process:

1. In the Explorer, right-click your accessory object and **Save to Roblox**.

2. In the Asset Configuration Window, set the **Content Type** to **Avatar Item**.
3. Complete the following fields (you can adjust them later):

   1. **Title**: The name of your accessory.
   2. **Description**: A short description of your asset.
   3. **Asset Category**: The type of accessory. This should match the Accessory Type selected during the [Fitting and Conversion](../../../art/accessories/creating-rigid/converting.md) process.
   4. **Creator**: Use the dropdown to select if you'd like to publish this asset as an individual or as part of an associated group.
   5. **Tags**: Add up to 5 tags to your asset. These are used to aid search and discovery in the catalog.

4. After you select the **Asset Category**, Studio begins validating the asset to ensure that it matches Roblox's accessory technical requirements.
   1. If set up correctly, the window displays a green Validation Successful confirmation.
   2. If errors appear, see the error messages for specific details. Some errors may require going back to the modeling software and adjusting the asset.
5. If the validation is successful, you can submit the asset to the upload and moderation queue for a fee. See [Fees and Commissions](../../../art/marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md) for current fee information.
