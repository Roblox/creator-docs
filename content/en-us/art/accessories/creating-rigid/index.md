Rigid accessories are 3D objects that users can equip to their avatar characters in an experience or through Roblox's [Marketplace](https://www.roblox.com/catalog) and [Avatar Editor](https://www.roblox.com/my/avatar).

Unlike clothing or bodies, rigid accessories do not require additional configuration in a third-party application beyond modeling and texturing, rigid accessories are typically the most basic type of 3D avatar item to create.

This tutorial covers the basics of each step in the workflow to create your own simple 3D model in Blender and import it into Studio. From there, you can upload the accessory to the Marketplace to sell, save the asset to your toolbox, or use the asset in your experiences.

Creating, building, and sharing on Roblox is free. However, the last step of listing your item to sell requires a Premium Roblox account, an upload fee, and a publishing advance. For more information, see the [Marketplace policy](../../../marketplace/marketplace-policy.md#creator-requirements).
