title: Body Scale and Proportions
description: Avatars come in 3 different standard sizes, Classic, Rthro, Rthro Slender.
---

Roblox supports three common avatar sizes, known as **Classic**, **Rthro**, and **Rthro Slender**. This standard sizing helps keep avatar characters consistent, allowing developers to create experiences and environments that can fit commonly sized character models.

When modeling rigid accessories, like a helmet that contours around a character's head, it's important to use a mannequin to help ensure your proportions fit. The asset provided in this tutorial example was originally modeled using **Rthro** proportions. Layered accessories, such as clothing, don't require body type specification, since layered assets automatically stretch and deform over any body type.

If you are modeling your asset, visit the [References resources](../../avatar/resources.md#references) to download any of the following mesh mannequin:
