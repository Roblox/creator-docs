Layered clothing are cosmetic outfit accessories that naturally stretch and fit over any avatar body and existing layered items. You can combine layered clothing accessories with other avatar cosmetics to create a completely unique outfit and appearance.

You can create custom layered clothing assets by modeling the asset in a 3D software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) before importing the model into Studio. See the following resources for creating layered clothing accessories:

- [Layered Modeling Specifications](../../art/accessories/specifications.md#layered-requirements) for details on the requirements needed when modeling layered assets.
- [Creating Layered Clothing](../../art/accessories/creating-in-blender.md) for instructions on making a basic 3D asset layerable in Blender, using a reference 3D t-shirt model and a project template.
- [How We Built Beyond The Dark](../../resources/beyond-the-dark/index.md) for details on how Roblox implemented layered clothing technology in a [showcase demo](https://www.roblox.com/games/7208091524/Beyond-the-Dark-Vistech-Showcase).

After you have exported a model, use the [Accessory Fitting Tool](../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md) for instructions on converting the layered model into an `Class.Accessory` object.
