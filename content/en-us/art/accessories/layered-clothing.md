Layered clothing accessories are 3D cosmetic items that users can equip and wear on their avatar body, such as pants, t-shirt, jackets, dresses, and more. Unlike [rigid accessories](../../art/accessories/index.md) that only attach to a specific point on a character, layered clothing stretches and fits over any body type and existing clothing.

To create a custom Roblox accessory for your own experience or to sell on the Marketplace, it's important to start with the following:

- A general background with 3D modeling tools such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview).
- An understanding of the [components that make up a layered accessory](#components-of-a-layered-clothing-accessory).
- An understanding of the general [clothing creation process](#creation-process).
- Review Roblox's official tutorials to create your own accessories:
  - [Rigid accessory creation tutorial](../../art/accessories/creating-rigid/index.md) - covers each process required for converting a 3D model to a rigid accessory and publishing it to the Marketplace.
  - [Clothing creation tutorial](../../art/accessories/creating/index.md) - a step-by-step process of creating your own avatar-ready clothing from scratch in Blender.
- [Additional tools, resources, and guides](#resources) provided by Roblox to standardize and expedite the creation process.

Roblox also supports [classic clothing](#classic-clothing), 2D images that can be applied to your character's surface.

## Components of a layered clothing accessory

All accessory models are made up of the same base components of a [mesh object](#mesh-part), [textures](#textures), and [attachment](#attachments). Layered clothing requires additional components, such as a [poseable rig](#rigging-armature), and an [inner and outer cage](#inner-and-outer-cages), to allow the asset to stretch, fit, and layer over a target character and existing clothing items.

When [creating accessories](#creation-process), all of the components are created first in your modeling software, then converted to their appropriate Roblox Studio instance on import.

### Mesh part

<figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Mesh-Bow-Example.png" /><figcaption>Bow accessory mesh object</figcaption></figure>
</GridContainer>

<Alert severity = 'warning'>
Simple accessories, such as the bow, are [rigid accessories](../../art/accessories/index.md) do not require the rigging and caging components that allow it to stretch and fit over a target.
</Alert>

All accessories require a single mesh object that represents the geometry of the accessory object. In Studio, this mesh object is represented as a `Class.MeshPart` nested under a single `Class.Model`

### Textures

<GridContainer numColumns="2">

  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Texture-Applied-Example.png" /><figcaption>T-shirt model with texture applied</figcaption></figure>
</GridContainer>

Textures are image files that define the surface appearance of your accessory. You can create textures within a texture painting program or a 3D modeling software. In Studio, textures images are imported as image assets and are set to `Class.MeshPart` objects by a child `Class.SurfaceAppearance` object or a `Class.MeshPart.TextureID` property.

### Attachments

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Attachment-Example.png" />  <figcaption>Attachment geometry defines where the attachment connects with the character</figcaption></figure>

  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Attachment-Data-Model-Example.png" width="80%"/><figcaption>Geometry with the "_Att" suffix automatically convert to `Class.Attachment` objects in Studio</figcaption></figure>
</GridContainer>

For layered clothing, the attachment point is used to associate with the correct body part when the body ragdolls or is dismembered. In Studio, attachments are represented by `Class.Attachment` objects.

Attachments for clothing items are automatically generated in Studio using the [Accessory Fitting Tool](../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md).

### Rigging armature

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Rigging-Example.png" />  <figcaption>To ensure natural movement of the clothing item, it must be weighted to a character rig</figcaption></figure>

  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Rigging-Pose-Example.png" /><figcaption>When the rig is properly set up, the layered model can move and bend with the character rig</figcaption></figure>
</GridContainer>

A rigging armature defines how a layered asset can move with a character model. Using rigging and skinning techniques, you can set the areas of your clothes to move naturally with a character model's joints, such as ensuring a shirt sleeve correctly follows the movement of the elbow and shoulder. In Studio, this rigging and skinning data is saved to the mesh geometry.

### Inner and outer cages

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Inner-Cage-Example.png" />  <figcaption>The inner cage defines the inner surface of the clothing item where the clothes wrap over</figcaption></figure>

  <figure><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Outer-Cage-Example.png" /><figcaption>The outer cage defines the outer surface of the clothing item where any additional clothes can wrap and layer over</figcaption></figure>
</GridContainer>

Cage meshes indicate the inner and outer surfaces of a layered accessory. The inside cage of a t-shirt defines how the t-shirt stretches and fits over a character body. The outer cage of a t-shirt defines how additional layered clothing fit over the t-shirt. In Studio, these cages are represented by `Class.WrapLayer` objects.

## Creation process

Custom accessories are first created in 3D modeling programs, such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview), before importing the `.fbx` or `.gltf` model into Studio.
To get started creating your first avatar asset, see [Avatar Tutorials](../../avatar/tutorials.md).

Depending on the type of asset you are creating, the creation process follows these high-level workflows:

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <figure><figcaption><center>Layered Accessory Workflow</center></figcaption><br /><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Workflow-Layered.png"/></figure>  
  
  <figure>  <figcaption><center>Rigid Accessory Workflow</center></figcaption><br /><img src="../../assets/art/accessories/Workflow-Rigid.png" /></figure>

</GridContainer>

<Alert severity = 'info'>
Since 3D creation isn't a linear process and always requires reiteration and testing, the process of creating an accessory can differ between individuals and various creation workflows.

## Resources

There are a variety of resources available for creators of all backgrounds to get started with accessory creation.

## Classic clothing

Classic clothing assets are 2D images that you can apply to the surface of an avatar body as t-shirts, shirts, or pants. You can design these assets in any image processing software, test the textures in Studio, and then upload the designs to the Marketplace to sell. See [Classic clothing](../../art/accessories/classic-clothing.md) for more information on creating, uploading, and selling these assets.
