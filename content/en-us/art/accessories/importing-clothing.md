description: Use the 3D Importer to add third-party models to Studio before using the Accessory Fitting Tool to convert the model to an Accessory.

Use the following instructions to [import](#importing-3d-assets) your `.fbx` or `.gltf` third-party model into Studio and [convert](#converting-layered-accessories) the asset to a clothing `Accessory` object that you can save to use in your experience, share with others, or upload to the Marketplace.

<Alert severity ='info'>
The following asset example and instructions are part of the [Clothing Accessory Tutorial](../accessories/creating/index.md) which covers the process of converting a model from Blender to publishing the asset to the Marketplace.

## Importing 3D Assets

Studio's 3D Importer provides a quick and easy way to import third-party 3D assets into your projects. The importer provides object previews and error-checking to ensure that your asset meets Roblox's [general 3D requirements](../modeling/specifications.md).

Keep in mind, your 3D layered accessory must also follow Roblox's [Clothing Specifications](../accessories/clothing-specifications.md) to eventually use this asset as a layered `Class.Accessory`, or you may experience errors later in the workflow.

To import your asset:

1. In Studio, navigate to the **Avatar tab** and select the **3D Importer**.
2. In the file browser, select the `.fbx` or `.gltf` file saved locally. The 3D Importer loads a preview of the object.

   - If textures don't load for your asset, you can manually import your textures later.
   - See [3D Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) for additional information on import settings and troubleshooting.

3. Select **Import**. The asset populates in your workspace as a `Class.Model` with the appropriate textures applied as a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` or `Class.MeshPart.TextureID`.

 If textures didn't load correctly, add them manually. You may need to save and publish your experience in order to access the [Asset Manager](../../projects/assets/manager.md).

1.  Open the Asset Manager. You may need to save and publish your experience before accessing your assets.
2.  In the Asset Manager, and select the **Bulk Import** button.

3.  Upload your image files.
4.  After moderation clears for your image, select the `Class.MeshPart` parented within your imported `Class.Model`.
5.  If you are using a single basic texture, set the `Class.MeshPart.TextureID` property to your uploaded texture image.
6.  If you are using PBR Textures:

    1. Add a `Class.SurfaceAppearance` child to your `Class.MeshPart`.

    2. In the `Class.SurfaceAppearance` properties, click each property value and assign the appropriate texture image from the asset dropdown:

       1. Set the **ColorMap** to the **\_ALB** texture image.
       2. Set the **MetalnessMap** to the **\_MTL** texture image.
       3. Set the **NormalMap** to the **\_NOR** texture image.
       4. Set the **RoughnessMap** to the **\_RGH** texture image.

After successful import, your model object should populate in your project as a `Class.Model` with the appropriate textures applied. See [3D Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md) for additional information on import settings and troubleshooting.

## Converting Layered Accessories

With the `Class.Model` in your project, the last step in the process of clothing creation requires you to use the Accessory Fitting Tool to convert this object to a standard `Class.Accessory` that avatar characters can equip.

To generate the accessory object:

1. In the Avatar tab, select the [**Accessory Fitting Tool**](../accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md). The Accessory Fitting Tool panel displays on the left side of the workspace.
2. Select the `Class.Model` of the clothing item in the viewport. The tool's text field populates with the name of the object selected. Alternatively, you can select the object within the Explorer window.
3. Test out various sample characters, clothing, and animations. See [Testing Accessories](../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md#testing-accessories) for additional information.
   - If required, make minor cage adjustments using the editing features. Larger cage changes may require returning to your third-party modeling software and re-exporting the asset.
4. When ready to generate your accessory, click **Generate MeshPart Accessory**. The Accessory object with your model populates in your workspace.
   For additional information and documentation on the tool, see [Accessory Fitting Tool](../../art/accessories/accessory-fitting-tool.md).

      </GridContainer>

After successful fitting and converting, your 3D model should populate in your project as an `Class.Accessory`. With this `Class.Accessory` you can perform any of the following:

- Begin the process of [uploading and publishing](../../art/marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md#uploading-an-asset) the clothing accessory to the Marketplace.

- Use the accessory in your current experience by equipping it to character models with [HumanoidDescription](../../characters/appearance.md#humanoiddescription), or by dragging and dropping the accessory under the appropriate character `Class.Model` object.

- Save the accessory to your [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md) or make it public on the [Creator Store](../../production/publishing/creator-store.md) to share or use within any of your experiences.
