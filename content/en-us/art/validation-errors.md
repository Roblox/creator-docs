title: Validation Errors
description: A list of all validation errors that can occur when uploading avatar items to the Marketplace.
---

When [uploading avatar items](../marketplace/publish-to-marketplace.md#upload-an-asset) to the Marketplace, Roblox validates the submission to ensure that the asset meets the appropriate specification for that asset type, such as [clothing specifications](./accessories/clothing-specifications.md).

<Alert severity = 'info'>
Assets that aren't intended for the Marketplace, such as those used only in-experience, do not need to pass this validation process. However, you may find this validation check useful to troubleshoot issues with any custom accessories or bodies.
</Alert>

The following is a table of all possible validation error codes, as well as any additional notes or context that may help you troubleshoot:
