title: Custom Meshes
description: External modeling is the use of a third-party modeling software to create custom meshes.
---

**Custom meshes** are 3D objects that enhance the visual appeal and uniqueness of your environment and characters. In Studio, custom meshes are represented as `Class.MeshPart` objects, and you can use them to create assets like characters, clothing, environment props, and cosmetics. To create a custom mesh, you must use a third-party modeling application, such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview), to design and model the asset before importing the 3D object into Studio.

Many 3D assets, like characters, are made up of several meshes and are represented in Studio as a single `Class.Model`. See [Models](../../parts/models.md) for more information.

In Roblox, custom 3D assets generally fall under three types of applications:

- **Generic meshes or models** you can use for environmental props, buildings, characters, and decoration within an experience.
- **Avatar models** for users or non-player characters (NPCs).
- **Accessory models** that character models can equip and wear, like clothing and cosmetics.

Creators who are part of the [UGC Program](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) can publish and sell their models on the Marketplace and earn a commission for each sale. For more information, see [Creating and Selling](#creating-and-selling).

## Supported Meshes

Roblox supports many types of custom meshes, as long as they adhere to the [general mesh specifications](../../art/modeling/specifications.md). A basic custom mesh consists of at least one mesh object and one texture:

</GridContainer>

Studio also supports meshes that include [rigging and skinning](#rigging-and-skinning) data, [PBR textures](#pbr-textures), and other [Studio-related objects](#studio-related-objects) like cage meshes and attachments. Many of these various components are required if you are creating avatar character models or accessories.

### Rigging and Skinning

A **rigged mesh** is a mesh with an internal poseable skeleton rig and bone structure. Rigged meshes allow mesh surfaces to rotate and move where internal bone joints are placed within a model, such as a character's knee or elbow. Skinning a rigged mesh allows the mesh object to bend organically, imitating the natural way joints would move in real life.

  </figure>
</GridContainer>

For more information on rigging and skinning, see [Rigging and Skinning](../../art/modeling/rigging.md).

### PBR Textures

**Physically-Based Rendering** (PBR) textures allow you to represent realistic shading and lighting by using multiple types of texture images, or **maps**, on a single object. Combining multiple texture maps can more accurately simulate color, roughness, and reflectivity in any lighting environment and can enhance the visual elements of your assets and environment.

</GridContainer>

For more information on PBR textures, see [PBR Textures](../../art/modeling/surface-appearance.md).

### Studio-Related Objects

Studio automatically converts certain types of objects found in 3D modeling files as specific workspace objects in the experience. These are typically used when creating a character or accessory, and configuring these in your modeling software can sometimes be the primary way of correctly setting up these Studio objects.

The following objects are automatically created in Studio if they are detected by the importer:

- `Class.Attachment` - Created when Studio detects mesh objects that include `_Att` at the end of their name.
- `Class.WrapTarget` - Created when Studio detects mesh objects that include `_OuterCage` at the end of their name.
- `Class.WrapLayer` - Created when Studio detects a mesh object with `_InnerCage` and similarly named mesh object with `_OuterCage` at the end of their names.
- `Class.FaceControls` - Created when Studio detects an avatar character head and the appropriate facial animation data in the model.

## Creating and Selling

Whether you are creating assets for sale on the Marketplace, or for a specific use within experiences, the creation workflow is typically the same:

1. **Design and Model** - Create the 3D asset in a third party application, such as Blender or Maya. Ensure that all assets follow any of the applicable requirements:
   1. [General Mesh Specifications](../../art/modeling/specifications.md)
   2. [Accessory Specifications](../../art/accessories/specifications.md)
   3. [Character Specifications](../../art/avatar/specifications.md)
   4. [Marketplace Policy](../../art/marketplace/marketplace-policy.md)
2. **Import into Studio** - Import the custom mesh or model into Studio using the [3D Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md).
3. **Test and Create** - Test the asset in your experience to ensure compatibility with your experience and environment. You may need to redesign your asset and go through additional iterations.
4. **Publish and Sell** - If you are part of the [UGC Program](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-and-changes-to-the-ugc-catalog-application/1974990) and your custom asset conforms to the [Marketplace Policy](../../art/marketplace/marketplace-policy.md), you can [publish your item](../../art/marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md) for others to purchase and receive a [commission](../../art/marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md) for each sale of your asset.
