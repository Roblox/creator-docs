The Roblox Blender Plugin is a Blender add-on that allows you to link your Roblox account and quickly transfer 3D modeling objects directly from Blender to your Studio session. This tool helps you save time and reduce errors by skipping the process of exporting and importing third-party modeling files between applications.

The Roblox Blender plugin is an open-source implementation of Roblox's [Open Cloud API](../../cloud/open-cloud/index.md) and developers are encouraged to extend and build upon this tool for their own projects. For installation, use, licensing, and contribution details, see the [Roblox Blender Plugin GitHub page](https://github.com/Roblox/roblox-blender-plugin).
