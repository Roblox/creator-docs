title: Character Name/Health Display
description: You can customize character UI, like name and health displays, using Class.Humanoid.
---

The `Class.Humanoid` instance is used to create character models, both for user avatars and NPCs. When a `Class.Humanoid` is present inside a `Class.Model` that contains a part named **Head**, Roblox displays a name and/or health bar above that part.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/Display-Indicated.jpg" width="800" alt="Character display information above an in-experience avatar" />

Through various `Class.Humanoid` properties, you can modify the following:

- The [distance](#display-distance-type) from which users can see the name/health of other humanoids in relation to their own character's humanoid.
- The [display name](#overriding-display-names) which shows over a humanoid.
- Whether a humanoid's [health bar](#health-display-type) always appears, never appears, or only appears when the humanoid is damaged.
- Whether names and health bars are [occluded](#occlusion) (hidden) when line-of-sight between the camera and another humanoid is blocked.

<Alert severity="warning">
As noted in the introduction, character name/health display requires that the `Class.Humanoid` instance is inside a `Class.Model` and that the model contains a `Class.BasePart` named **Head**. Both objects must also be at the same level in the model's hierarchy.
</Alert>

## Display Properties

### Display Distance Type

The `Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType` property sets how users see the name/health of other characters in relation to their own character.

#### Viewer

When a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType|DisplayDistanceType` is set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|HumanoidDisplayDistanceType.Viewer`, it sees the name/health of other humanoids within range of its own `Class.Humanoid.NameDisplayDistance|NameDisplayDistance` and `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance`. You can consider this the lowest priority since it is not taken into account for other humanoids configured as [subject](#subject) or [none](#none).

In the following scenario, the user's character (**Viewer**) has a larger `Class.Humanoid.NameDisplayDistance|NameDisplayDistance` than `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance`, as indicated by the circles. As a result, the user sees character names for both **Watchman** and **Octavia**, but only sees a health bar for **Watchman**.

#### Subject

When a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType|DisplayDistanceType` is set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|HumanoidDisplayDistanceType.Subject`, it takes **full&nbsp;control** over its own name and health display through its `Class.Humanoid.NameDisplayDistance|NameDisplayDistance` and `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance|HealthDisplayDistance` values. Effectively, other humanoids will only see the subject's name/health within those distances from the **subject** humanoid.

In the following scenario, both **Watchman** and **Octavia** are set to **Subject** and their `Class.Humanoid.NameDisplayDistance|NameDisplayDistance` ranges are indicated by the circles. Only the name **Octavia** is seen by the user whose character is standing inside her range but outside the **Watchman** humanoid's range.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/DisplayDistanceType-Subject.jpg" width="90%" />

#### None

When a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType|DisplayDistanceType` is set to `Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType|HumanoidDisplayDistanceType.None`, its name and health bar do not appear under any circumstances. In the following scenario, both **Watchman** and **Octavia** are set to **None**, so the other character does not see their name or health even when in range.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/DisplayDistanceType-None.jpg" width="90%" />

### Health Display Type

The `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType` property provides further control over the character's health bar visibility. The bar reflects the humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` as a factor of its `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth` and it changes color from green to yellow to red as the humanoid's health decreases.

#### AlwaysOn

When a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType` is set to `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|HumanoidHealthDisplayType.AlwaysOn`, its health bar always appears.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/HealthDisplayType-AlwaysOn.jpg" width="90%" />

#### DisplayWhenDamaged

A humanoid with `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType` set to `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|HumanoidHealthDisplayType.DisplayWhenDamaged` only shows a health bar when its `Class.Humanoid.Health|Health` is less than its `Class.Humanoid.MaxHealth|MaxHealth`. In the following scenario, **Watchman** has full health and does not display a health bar, but **Octavia** is damaged by 50% and displays a yellow health bar.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/HealthDisplayType-DisplayWhenDamaged.jpg" width="90%" />

#### AlwaysOff

When a humanoid's `Class.Humanoid.HealthDisplayType|HealthDisplayType` is set to `Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType|HumanoidHealthDisplayType.AlwaysOff`, its health bar never appears under any circumstances.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/HealthDisplayType-AlwaysOff.jpg" width="90%" />

### Occlusion

Occlusion (hiding) of humanoid names behind walls or other objects is controlled by the character's `Class.Humanoid.NameOcclusion` property.

<Alert severity="warning">
Occlusion does not occur if the occluding object's `Class.BasePart.Transparency|Transparency` is higher than&nbsp;0.99. Occlusion also does not occur when a humanoid is hidden behind a `Class.Model` containing a `Class.Humanoid`, such as another user's avatar character.
</Alert>

#### NoOcclusion

When a humanoid is hidden behind a visible object and its `Class.Humanoid.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion` is set to `Enum.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion.NoOcclusion`, its name and health are never occluded from viewing humanoids.

In the following scenario, both **Watchman** and **Octavia** are set to **NoOcclusion**. Although both are sufficiently hidden behind stone columns, the viewing humanoid still sees their name/health displays.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/NameOcclusion-NoOcclusion.jpg" width="90%" />

#### OccludeAll

When a humanoid is hidden behind a visible object and its `Class.Humanoid.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion` is set to `Enum.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion.OccludeAll`, its name and health are always occluded from viewing humanoids.

In the following scenario, both **Watchman** and **Octavia** are sufficiently hidden behind stone columns. **Watchman** is set to **OccludeAll**, so its name and health are hidden from the viewing humanoid. **Octavia**, however, is set to [NoOcclusion](#noocclusion) and her name/health remains visible to the viewing humanoid.

<img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/NameOcclusion-OccludeAll.jpg" width="90%" />

#### EnemyOcclusion

When a humanoid is hidden behind a visible object and its `Class.Humanoid.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion` is set to `Enum.NameOcclusion|NameOcclusion.EnemyOcclusion`, its name and health are only occluded from enemy humanoids (players on a different `Class.Team`).

In the following scenario, both **Watchman** and **Octavia** are sufficiently hidden behind stone columns, and both are set to **EnemyOcclusion**. The viewing humanoid and **Watchman** are on the same `Class.Team`, so name/health occlusion does not occur. However, the name and health of **Octavia**, on the opposing team, are occluded.

## Modifying Character Displays

### User Avatars

To modify the name or health display for every incoming avatar in an experience, connect the `Class.Players.PlayerAdded` and `Class.Player.CharacterAdded` events in a `Class.Script` and set [display properties](#display-properties) on the character's `Class.Humanoid`.

```lua title='Script - Global Customization' highlight='3,4,8,10,12,14,19'
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
		local humanoid = character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
		if humanoid then
			-- Give each humanoid full control over its name/health display distance
			humanoid.DisplayDistanceType = Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType.Subject
			-- Set name display distance to 20 studs
			humanoid.NameDisplayDistance = 20
			-- Set health bar display distance to 15 studs
			humanoid.HealthDisplayDistance = 15
			-- Only show health bar when humanoid is damaged
			humanoid.HealthDisplayType = Enum.HumanoidHealthDisplayType.DisplayWhenDamaged
		end
	end)
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

You can also customize properties based on a player's `Class.Team`, such as setting all "guard" players to a generic name, and hiding the names of all "ninja" players.

<span id="team-customization-script"></span>

```lua title='Script - Team Customization' highlight='9,12'
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
		local humanoid = character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
		if humanoid then
			-- Set the name of all guards to generic "Guard"
			if player.Team.Name == "Guards" then
				humanoid.DisplayName = "Guard"
			-- Hide the name for all ninjas
			elseif player.Team.Name == "Ninjas" then
				humanoid.DisplayDistanceType = Enum.HumanoidDisplayDistanceType.None
			end
		end
	end)
end

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

<Alert severity="info">
When a player is assigned to a `Class.Team`, their character's name appears in the same color as the team's `Class.Team.TeamColor|TeamColor`. This helps identify teammates and opposing players in team-based experiences.
</Alert>

### NPC Characters

For NPC characters already placed in the 3D world, you can edit name/health directly on the `Class.Humanoid` object in the [Properties](../studio/properties.md) window.

<GridContainer numColumns="2">
  <img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/Customize-NPC.jpg" />
  <img src="../assets/avatar/name-health-display/Humanoid-Properties.png" />
</GridContainer>

## Overriding Display Names

By default, a humanoid's display name matches the user's Roblox account **Display Name** which is unique and separate from their account **Username**. To show a fully custom name that's unrelated to the user's account, you can override the `Class.Humanoid.DisplayName` property.

### Setting Directly

You can set the `Class.Humanoid.DisplayName|DisplayName` property of any `Class.Humanoid` instance which you gain reference to through a `Class.Script`, such as the [team&nbsp;customization](#team-customization-script) example, or directly on an [NPC](#npc-characters) character's **Humanoid** object.

### Setting Through User Input

In some genres like roleplaying or fighting, you may want to provide a method for users to input their own character name, pet character name, etc. which is specific to the experience and isn't tied to their account display name.

<img src="../assets/ui/button-text-input/TextBox-Example.jpg" width="80%" />

You can gather this input on the client side through a `Class.TextBox` name entry or whatever suits the experience's interface, then pass it to the server with a [remote event](../scripting/events/remote.md). On the server side, you can listen for the remote event and assign the [filtered](../ui/text-filtering.md) name to the user character's `Class.Humanoid`.

```lua title='LocalScript - Fire Remote Event' highlight='3,4'
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local changeNameEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("ChangeNameEvent")
changeNameEvent:FireServer("Amory")
```

```lua title='Script - Assign Filtered Name' highlight='15,20,23,28'
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local TextService = game:GetService("TextService")

-- Create remote event to receive text from client for filtering
local changeNameEvent = Instance.new("RemoteEvent")
changeNameEvent.Name = "ChangeNameEvent"
changeNameEvent.Parent = ReplicatedStorage

local function onRequestNameChange(player, newName)
	local character = player.Character
	local humanoid = character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")

	local filterResult
	local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
		filterResult = TextService:FilterStringAsync(newName, player.UserId)
	end)
	if success then
		local filteredName
		local success, errorMessage = pcall(function()
			filteredName = filterResult:GetNonChatStringForBroadcastAsync()
		end)
		if success and humanoid then
			humanoid.DisplayName = filteredName
		end
	end
end

changeNameEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(onRequestNameChange)
```
