### Daily Engagement Rewards

Creators earn 5 Robux each day if their experience is one of the first three an Active Spender plays for 10+ minutes.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
    <th><b>Qualifying Action</b></th>
    <th><b>Timeframe</b></th>
    <th><b>Payout</b></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Active Spender engages with Creator's experience for 10+ minutes in a day, provided it's one of the first three experiences they launch that day</td>
      <td>Awarded on a daily basis (24 hour period)</td>
      <td>5 Robux</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Daily Engagement Rewards pays Creators 5 Robux for each user who spends at least 10 minutes in their experience over the course of the day. To qualify, the experience must be one of the first three experiences that the user visits that day, and the user must spend at least 10 minutes in it. Users must be Active Spenders (meaning they must have spent at least $9.99 in the past 60 days) for their sessions to be eligible.

<h6 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Example 1</h6>

An Active Spender visits 5 experiences during the day in the following order:

1. Experience A for 2 minutes
2. Experience B for 5 minutes
3. Experience C for 10 minutes
4. Experience D for 5 minutes
5. Experience A for 10 minutes
6. Experience E for 15 minutes

Experience A (where the user spent a total of 12 minutes), Experience C (where the user spent 10 minutes), and Experience E (where the user spent 15 minutes) each earn 5 Robux that day.

Experience B and Experience D do not earn 5 Robux because the user didn't spend 10 or more minutes in them that day.

<h6 style={{marginTop: '36px'}}>Example 2</h6>

An Active Spender visits 5 experiences during the day in the following order:

1. Experience A for 2 minutes
2. Experience B for 10 minutes
3. Experience C for 15 minutes
4. Experience D for 5 minutes
5. Experience E for 15 minutes
6. Experience A for 15 minutes

Experience A (where the user spent a total of 17 minutes), Experience B (where the user spent 10 minutes), and Experience C (where the user spent 15 minutes) each earn 5 Robux because they were the first three experiences the user visited and spent at least 10 minutes in that day.

Experience D does not earn 5 Robux because the user only spent 5 minutes in it.

Experience E also does not earn 5 Robux because it was the fourth experience the user visited that day, even though they spent over 10 minutes in it.

### Audience Expansion Rewards

The audience expansion rewards system compensates Creators for bringing New Users to Roblox or for
turning a Lapsed User into a Reactivated User. When one of these qualifying users joins or returns
and is attributed to a Creator, the Creator earns a 35% revenue share on their first $100 of
Qualifying Purchases anywhere on the platform during their first 60 days﹡.

    <th><b>Timeframe</b></th>
    <th><b>Payout</b></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>New User or Reactivated User clicks the Creator's experience's Share Link, which results
      in the user joining or rejoining Roblox, and plays that experience for 10+ minutes within the
      same day; AND the experience maintains an average of 100+ DAU for 60 days after the joining or
      rejoining date.</td>
      <td>60 days</td>
      <td>35% revenue share on their first $100 of Qualifying Purchases anywhere on the platform﹡</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>New User or Reactivated User clicks the Creator's experience's direct link, which leads to
      entering that experience as the user's first session on the day of joining or rejoining
      Roblox, and plays the experience for 10+ minutes that day; excluding users who join or
      rejoined via a Share Link; AND the experience maintains an average of 100+ DAU for 60 days
      after the joining or rejoining date.</td>
      <td>60 days</td>
      <td>35% revenue share on their first $100 of Qualifying Purchases anywhere on the platform﹡</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>New or Reactivated User searches the Creator's specific experience name, which leads to
      entering that experience as the user's first session on the day of joining or rejoining
      Roblox, and plays the experience for 10+ minutes that day; excluding users who join or
      rejoined via a Share Link; AND the experience maintains an average of 100+ DAU for 60 days
      after the joining or rejoining date.</td>
      <td>60 days</td>
      <td>35% revenue share on their first $100 of Qualifying Purchases anywhere on the platform﹡</td>

  standing and a valid DevEx account. You can check your eligibility in the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/settings/eligibility/creator-rewards).

### What terms apply to Creator Rewards?

- A fair and equitable Creator Rewards program is in everyone's best interest – creators, players,
  and the platform alike. It's vital that rewards go to creators driving genuine user growth and
  engagement. Participation in Creator Rewards requires adherence to Roblox Terms of Use including
  the Roblox Community Standards.
- To uphold the integrity of the program for all participants, all Creator Rewards are contingent on
  genuine engagement from users who participate economically on the platform. We actively monitor
  for and discount inauthentic user activity. Misuse or attempts to exploit the system can result in
  penalties, including forfeit of illegitimate rewards, removal from the Creator Rewards program,
  and/or account termination.
- Specifically, we do not allow:
  - **Artificial or Automated Activity**: Using bots, automated tools, browser extensions, plugins,
    or manipulating teleports to artificially generate visits, referrals, or engagement time.
  - **Encouraging Alt Accounts for Rewards**: Audience Expansion Rewards are limited to one per
    user, and we use various inputs like unique device ID, IP, and payment data to detect alts.
    Encouraging existing users to create or use alternate accounts is strictly prohibited.
  - **Impersonation or Misrepresentation**: Impersonating Roblox, other individuals, or
    misrepresenting affiliations to gain rewards (e.g., in referral attempts).
  - **Fraudulent Transactions**: Rewards may be withheld for accounts that generate a
    disproportionately high percentage of chargeback, as defined at Roblox's discretion.
  - **Violation of Policies**: Any violation of the Roblox Terms of Use, Roblox Community Standards,
    or general Program Policies.
- Audience Expansion Rewards are limited to one per user, and Roblox uses a variety of inputs
(e.g. unique device identifier) to identify and remove credit for "alt" accounts.

### Will Paid Access experiences be eligible for Creator Rewards?

Yes. Paid access experiences are eligible to earn Robux from Creator Rewards.

### Who counts as an Active Spender?

Active Spenders are users who have been active on the platform for at least 60 days and have spent
at least $9.99 in the last 60 days.

### What is happening with Engagement Based Payouts and Creator Affiliate programs?

- Engagement Based Payouts and Creator Affiliate programs have been discontinued and replaced with
Creator Rewards, which is the next step in our goal to support creators who bring engaging content
to our platform.
- With Engagement Based Payouts, we found that creators lacked transparency into which actions drove
  higher earnings and predictability in how those earnings would evolve over time. We want to put
  creators in control, with more transparency into the actions they can take to earn higher rewards.
  With Creator Rewards, creators who publish engaging content can earn, directly from Roblox, for
  the engagement their content drives on the platform.
