title: Error Codes and Limits
description: Error codes you might come across and limits you might hit when using data stores to store data.
---

Requests you make to data stores can fail due to poor connectivity or other issues. To handle errors and return messages with an error code, wrap data store functions in `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()`.

## Limits

Data models have **limits**. If an experience exceeds these limits, the service automatically throttles the experience's data store usage and causes future requests to be placed in one of the following queues:

- Set
- Ordered set
- Get
- Ordered get

Requests in a queue are handled in the order they are received. The called function continues to yield as long as its request is still queued. If the data store key itself is throttled, the request is placed in a queue but is temporarily skipped.

Each queue has a limit of 30 requests. When the limit of a queue is reached, requests fail with an error code in the 301-306 range, indicating that the requests have been dropped entirely.

### Server Limits

Each server is allowed a certain number of data store requests based on the request type and number of users. Use `Class.DataStoreService:GetRequestBudgetForRequestType()|GetRequestBudgetForRequestType()` to confirm the number of data store requests that the current place can make.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Request Type</th>
    <th>Functions</th>
    <th>Requests per Minute</th>
  </tr>

    <td>`Class.DataStore:RemoveVersionAsync()|RemoveVersionAsync()`</td>
    <td>5 + numPlayers × 2</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Data Limits

Data stores limit how much data can be used per entry.

The data store name, key name, and [scope](../../cloud-services/data-stores/managing-data-stores.md#scopes) must all be under a certain character length. Use `Library.string.len()` to check their length.

The data (key value) is also stored as a string, regardless of its initial type. You can check the size of the data with the `Class.HttpService:JSONEncode()|JSONEncode()` function, which converts Lua data into a serialized JSON table.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th>Maximum Number of Characters</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Store Name</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Key Name</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scope</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data (Key Value)</td>
    <td>4,194,304 per key</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Metadata Limits

Limits to the number of characters in user-defined metadata.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Component</th>
    <th>Maximum Number of Characters</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Key Name</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value</td>
    <td>250</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Key-value Pairs</td>
    <td>300</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Alert severity="info">
  There's no limit to the total number of key-value pairs, but the total size can't exceed 300 characters.
</Alert>

### Throughput Limits

Per-key throughput limits ensure that performance is optimal on Roblox servers. Each limit applies to every single key across all servers in an experience and refreshes over time.

Roblox examines the usage of quota associated with the key over the last 60 seconds. If the usage, including the current request, is within the throughput limit, the request is approved. If the usage exceeds the limit, the request is denied.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Request Type</th>
    <th>Limit</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Read</td>
    <td>25 MB per minute</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Write</td>
    <td>4 MB per minute</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<Alert severity="info">
  For every request, Roblox rounds throughput up to the next kilobyte. For example, if you write 800 bytes and 1.2 KB in two requests, Roblox counts that as 3 KB total throughput (1 KB and 2 KB, respectively).
</Alert>
