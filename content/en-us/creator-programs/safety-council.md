## FAQs

### When can I expect to hear back after applying?

Due to the volume of applications, we will not be able to respond to every application. If you have not heard back about your application in 1 month, you can assume you have not been accepted into the current cohort. We encourage you to reapply in 6 months. Check our program status page for application status.

### If I'm not accepted into the Community Safety Council, can I re-apply?

Yes, applications will be open twice a year. We will update the status of the program when we are accepting applications. Previous applicants are eligible to reapply.

### How many people will be on the Council?

Our plan is to start with 20 - but this is a new program, and depending on the volume and quality of applications, we may choose to expand.

### Can I be on the Council more than once?

We want to ensure that we include a diverse group of creators and influencers which is why we are accepting applicants for two separate cohorts each year. That said, we remain open to the possibility of extended participation on a limited basis. We are fine-tuning the program and will provide any major updates to eligibility or otherwise on this page.

### Will you announce who is part of the Council?

Out of respect for the privacy of Council members, we do not intend to announce who is on the Council. If members of the Council are willing to share their participation, they are able to do so but it is not a requirement for the program.
