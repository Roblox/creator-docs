<Alert severity="error">
Effective on July 24, 2025, the Creator Affiliate program will be deprecated and replaced by the [Creator Rewards](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-creator-rewards-earn-more-by-growing-the-community/3777628) program.
</Alert>

The [Creator Affiliate Pilot Program](https://create.roblox.com/affiliate) rewards creators for bringing new users to Roblox. If accepted into our program, you can earn up to 50% of spend when new users sign up via your affiliate share links and purchase Robux. Earnings are capped at $100 USD per new user and based on their first six months of purchasing Robux. You receive your revenue in Robux, which you can exchange for real-world money through the [DevEx program](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/devex).

This program is currently in pilot, and we intend to expand to all eligible creators by mid-2025.

## Eligibility

We are looking for creators, influencers, and studios with one or more of the following:

- **A track record of successfully developed experiences and products**, either on or off Roblox. You can demonstrate this through player count, sales estimates, and overall popularity.
- **A strong presence on social, video, and gaming platforms.** You can demonstrate this through follower count and post engagement.
- **The ability to reach [new audiences](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/roblox-genre-insights-what-will-you-create-next) and meet their needs in growing genres and markets.** Growing genres include open world action, sports, driving, and social cooperation, and growing markets include Japan, India, Germany, Brazil, and South Korea.
- **Marketing expertise.** You can demonstrate this through previous creative and successful marketing campaigns, as well as through the quality of your Creator Affiliate Pilot Program application.

## How it works

You can add your affiliate link to:

- YouTube videos, video descriptions, and your YouTube about page
- Social media posts on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok
- Content on your website, email newsletters, and other written mediums like blog posts and articles

You should use hyperlinks and text links to reference anchor text (for example, "Join Roblox for free"). If you want to share the direct affiliate link without an anchor text, make sure to use a custom URL shortener instead of pasting the full link.

You must also provide an FTC disclosure that mentions you might earn a commission from your affiliate link.

- Be at least 13 years old (if under 18 years old, you must have parental or guardian consent)
- Meet our [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards)
