The Creator Affiliate Program rewards creators for bringing new users to Roblox. If accepted into our program, you can earn up to 50% of spend when new users sign up via your affiliate share links and purchase Robux. Earnings are capped at $100 USD per new user and based on their first six months of purchasing Robux. This program is currently in pilot, and we intend to expand to all eligible creators by mid-2025.
