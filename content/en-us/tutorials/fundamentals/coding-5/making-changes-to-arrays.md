An array's contents will often have to be changed, like when needing to remove an item from a player's inventory. Lua has **prebuilt functions** for use with tables to make this easier.

This article will outline prebuilt functions for tables like add and remove while describing how to search for a value.

To apply these skills, you'll create a script that helps to manage a player's inventory in a game.

## Adding Values to Arrays

To add a new value to an array, use `table.insert(array, valueToInsert)`. The second parameter can be any value such as a string, number, or entire object, like `Class.Player` or `Class.IntValue`.

To practice, you'll create a script that stores player items in a table, then add to it. Since this example is just a script, it can be used with any file or project. Testing the code will be done using the Output Window.

1. Create an empty array named `playerItems`.

   ```lua
   playerItems = {}
   ```

2. Add inventory items to the array by typing `Library.table.insert()`. In the parenthesis, type `playerItems`, the table to add to, followed by a string for each item. Insert at least three values.

   ```lua
    playerItems = {}

    table.insert(playerItems, "Potion")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Bread")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Sleeping Bag")

    print(playerItems)
   ```

3. Run the project. In Output, expand the three dots `...` to see the printed table.

## Removing Values from Arrays

To remove a value, like if a player used an item or someone in a list of active players leaves an experience, use `Library.table.remove()`. Depending on the parameters provided, the function can either remove the last value of a table, or at a specific index.

### Removing the Last Value

Sometimes a script needs to remove a specific item. For instance, removing the first item in a player's inventory, or picking the first player in a list. To remove the last value in an array, use `Library.table.remove(arrayName)`. In this use case, the only parameter needed is the table itself.

1. Use the array of items from the previous example. Then, to remove the last value from the table, in this case `"Sleeping Bag"`, type `Library.table.remove(playerItems)`

   ```lua
    playerItems = {}

    table.insert(playerItems, "Potion")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Bread")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Sleeping bag")

    table.remove(playerItems)

    print(playerItems )
   ```

2. Run the project. In the Output window, the last value, `"Sleeping Bag"`, shouldn't print.

### Removing by Index

To remove a value at a specific point in the array, input in the second parameter the index to remove, such as `table.remove(arrayName, 1)`.

1. Using the same table, type `Library.table.remove()`. In the parameters, input the name of the table and `1`, the value to remove.

   ```lua
    playerItems = {}

    table.insert(playerItems, "Potion")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Bread")
    table.insert(playerItems, "Sleeping bag")

    table.remove(playerItems, 1)
   ```

   <Alert severity="warning">
   The second parameter for `Library.table.remove()` only accepts a numerical index. Typing something like `"Potion"` will create an error.
   </Alert>

2. Run the project. Check that the first value, "Potion" was removed.

<Alert severity="info">
Notice also that all the index values changed or have been pushed. Removing a value from an array will change the array size and shift index values **down** after the one removed. `"Bread"` is now index 1, and `"Sleeping Bag"` is now index 2.
</Alert>

## Searching for Values in an Array

There's no built-in function to search an array. To find specific values in arrays, like the name of a winning player, you'll need to code your own **search function** using for loops and if statements.

### Finding and Returning a Single Value

To find a value in an array, create a function named `findValue()` that goes through an array and stops the first time it finds a matching value.

Once it finds the value, the function will use the `return` keyword to return that value's index. With an index, you can remove it from the array.

1. Copy the array named `playerItems` below.

   ```lua
    local playerItems = {
       "Potion",
       "Bread",
       "Bread",
       "Sleeping Bag"
    }
   ```

2. Code a new function named findValue() with two parameters:

   - `whichArray` - the array to search through.
   - `itemName` - the specific string to check for.

     ```lua
     local function findValue(whichArray, itemName)

     end
     ```

3. In `findValue()`, use a for loop to check if any value in the array matches `itemName`. If the value matches, use the keyword `return` to return the value found in `currentIndex`.

   ```lua
   local function findValue(whichArray, itemName)
      for currentIndex = 1, #whichArray do
      if whichArray[currentIndex] == itemName then
         return currentIndex
      end
      end
   end
   ```

4. Test the search function by creating a variable named `valueFound` and calling `findValue()`. Pass in the array to search, and what value it should search for. **Run** the code to confirm that the expected output is index 2.

   ```lua
    local function findValue(whichArray, itemName)
      for currentIndex = 1, #whichArray do
          if whichArray[currentIndex] == itemName then
             --Sends the value of currentIndex back
             return currentIndex
          end
       end
    end

    local valueFound = findValue(playerItems, "Bread")

    print("The value is at index " .. valueFound)
   ```

### Removing a Value

If a value was found using the find function, it can be removed. Check if a value was found with an if statement.

1. Check if a value is inside `valueFound`; if so, remove the value using `Library.table.remove()`.

   ```lua
    if valueFound then
        table.remove(playerItems, valueFound)
    end
   ```

2. Print out the array using the code below.

   ```lua
   for index = 1, #playerItems do
      local itemString = playerItems[index]
      print("Index " .. index .. ": " .. itemString)
   end
   ```

3. Playtest and check that the first `"Bread"` value was removed from the array. Try removing other values by changing the second parameter in `findValue()`.

   Notice that because this function was called once, only the first instance of `"Bread"` was removed. The following section will cover how to find and remove all instances.

## Finding and Removing All of a Specific Value

While the previous code could only remove the first instance of a value found, this code snippet will find and remove all occurrences from an array. For example, if, say, a player wanted to sell all their bread at an in-game store.

1. Use an array named `playerItems` with at least four values and a set of **duplicates**.

   ```lua
    local playerItems = {
    "Potion",
    "Bread",
    "Bread",
    "Sleeping Bag"
    }
   ```

2. To go through the array, create a for loop that goes **backward** through `playerItems`, starting at `#playerItems`, ending at 1, and incrementing by -1.

   ```lua
   for index = #playerItems, 1, -1 do

   end
   ```

    <Alert severity="warning">
    Remember, removing items causes later indexes to shift. By starting at the end, you avoid skipping a value that may have shifted if you started at the beginning.
    </Alert>

3. In the loop, use an if statement to check if the value inside `playerItems[index]` is equal to `"Bread"`, and if so, remove the item.

   ```lua
   for index = #playerItems, 1, -1 do
      if playerItems[index] == "Bread" then
         table.remove(playerItems, index)
      end
   end
   ```

4. Use the code below to add a second for loop that prints the array.

   ```lua
   for index = 1, #playerItems do
     local itemString = playerItems[index]
     print("Index " .. index .. ": " .. itemString)
   end
   ```

5. Run the script and check that all values named "Bread" are removed.

## Summary

Values can be removed or added to an array, but be careful of indexes shifting doing so. Use loops to iterate through a table to remove all instances of a value, or just the first instance found.

The keyword `return` can be used to stop a loop, and send information back where needed.

A finished version of the script can be referenced below.

The following project includes all scripts in this tutorial. Download [here](../../../assets/education/coding-5/Making_Changes_to_Arrays_-_Final_Project.rbxl).

Note all scripts are in **ServerScriptService** and **disabled**. To use a script, in its properties, uncheck the Disabled field and run Studio.
