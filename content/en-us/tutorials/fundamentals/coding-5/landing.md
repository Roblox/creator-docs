### Series description

Data structures are how coders store and organize entire sets of data. In Luau, data structures are tables. Unlike variables, tables can hold any number of values. Tables can store a list of high scores, a player's inventory, or all of an object's properties. Two types of tables covered in this series are **dictionaries** and **arrays**.

### Objectives and prerequisites

<table>
<tbody>
   <tr>
    <td width="20%"><b>Learning Objectives</b></td>
    <td>
    Learn common structures for storing sets of information, such as arrays and dictionaries, and use cases for each structure.

    Be able to manipulate data structures, such as adding, removing, or returning values from a structure like an array.
    </td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><b>Prerequisites</b></td>
    <td>
    Have a general understanding of variables in Luau.

    Feel comfortable using conditional statements (`if` and `else`) and loops (`for` and `while`).
