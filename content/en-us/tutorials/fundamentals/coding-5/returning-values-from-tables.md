A common need in many data structures is to return values. This article will cover searching a table using `pairs()` or `ipairs()` for half of any table element, such as the key or value, to find and return the other half.

The example uses an array listing ships waiting to be repaired. `ipairs()` is used to return a ship's place in line.

```lua
local shipToFind = "Void Racer"

-- Ships waiting for repair
local waitingShips = {"Battle Sun", "Void Racer", "The Big Slow"}

-- Get place in line
local function getPlaceInLine(shipName)
	for placeInLine,ship in ipairs(waitingShips) do
		if ship == shipName then
			return placeInLine
		end
	end
end

--Print place in line
local placeInLine = getPlaceInLine(shipToFind)
print("Your place in line is " .. placeInLine)
```

## Dictionary Search Example

Have you ever searched for a lost pet in house going room by room? On your own code a function to search through a dictionary named house to see which room holds a lost puppy.

1. Copy the dictionary below to act as the house.

   ```lua
   local house = {
       kitchen = "pile of Junk",
       livingRoom = "kitten",
       bedroom1 = "nobody there",
       bedroom2 = "puppy",
   }
   ```

2. Create a new function called `findPet()` to search the dictionary. Include parameters for what dictionary to search, and what value to search for.
3. Use `pairs()` to iterate through the dictionary. Try coding your own before checking your work in the solution below.

   ```lua
   local function findPet(whereToSearch, searchFor)
     for place, value in pairs(whereToSearch) do

     end
   end
   ```

4. As the for loop iterates through the dictionary, use `return` to pass back the room where the pet was found.

   ```lua
   local function findPet(whereToSearch, searchFor)
     for place, value in pairs(whereToSearch) do
       if value == searchFor then
         return place
       end
     end
   end
   ```
