### Series Description

As you continue to work with code, scripts will become more complex. To address this, coders have a variety of techniques to make coding efficient, easy to understand, and reduce the chance of error. This series covers methods of organizing scripts, such as module scripts, a special type in script that can store functions and variables used by other scripts.
