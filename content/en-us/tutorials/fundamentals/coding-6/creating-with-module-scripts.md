To apply your knowledge of module scripts, create a module script that allows players to pick up keys and use them to open treasure chests.

<video controls src="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/final-example.mp4"></video>

## Project Setup

This project includes a starter map with leaderboard and scripted pickup objects for the keys and treasure chests.

### Load the Starter Project

1. Download the starter project.

   <a href="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/Intro_to_Module_Scripts_-_Starter_Project.rbxl">
   <Button variant="contained">Download</Button>
   </a>

2. In Roblox Studio, open the downloaded file: _Intro to Module Scripts - Starter Project.rbxl_.
   <img src="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/module-template-example.jpeg" width="50%" />

### Create a Module Script

So players can get treasure from chests, create a module script named _TreasureManager_. Using a module script will connect the pickups and leaderboards together.

1. In **ServerStorage**, create a new **ModuleScript** and rename it _TreasureManager_.
   <img src="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/create-module-script.png" width="50%" />

2. In _TreasureManager_, rename the default module table by replacing `module` with `TreasureManager` in both places.

   ```lua
   local TreasureManager = {}

   return TreasureManager
   ```

## Using Functions in Module Scripts

To test how functions work in module scripts, create a new function named `getKey()`. When the `getKey()` function is called from another script, it'll receive a key part to destroy and add 1 to the number of keys in the player's inventory.

### Create a Module Function for keys

1. This module script will use a combination of module and local functions, type **two** comments to help you keep them separated.

   ```lua
   local TreasureManager = {}

   ------------------ Local Functions

   ------------------ Module Functions

   return TreasureManager
   ```

2. Under the **Module Functions** comment, add a new module function to `TreasureManager` named `getKey()`.

   Use two parameters:

   - `keyPart` - the part to destroy.
   - `whichCharacter` - the player that touched the key part.

   ```lua
   local TreasureManager = {}

   ------------------ Local Functions

   ------------------ Module Functions
   function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)

   end

   return TreasureManager
   ```

3. In `getKey()`, destroy `keyPart`.

   ```lua
   function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
      keyPart:Destroy()
   end
   ```

### Use the Module Function

Now, the module function `getKey()` can be used in other scripts. To test that function, you'll open a premade script and call it.

1. Open the key script in **Workspace** > _Keys_ > _KeyScript_.

2. In keyScript, store the module script in a variable named `treasureManager` and set it equal to:
   `require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))`

   ```lua
   local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
   -- Require the module script below ⯆
   local treasureManager = require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))

   local keys = script.Parent
   local keysFolder = keys.Parts
   local keysArray = keysFolder:GetChildren()
   ```

   <Alert severity="success">

   Prevent errors by using `WaitForChild()` instead of the dot operator to make the script wait until `TreasureManager` has loaded before moving on. For scripts in ServerScriptService or ServerStorage, it's safe to use the dot operator instead, like in `Class.ServerStorage.TreasureManager`.
   </Alert>

3. There's already a function named `partTouched()` to check for a player touching the part. Inside `partTouched()`:

   - Call the `getKey()` module function to destroy the key.
   - Pass in `keyPart` and `whichCharacter`.

   ```lua
   local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
   -- Require the module script below ⯆
   local treasureManager = require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))

   local keys = script.Parent
   local keysFolder = keys.Parts
   local keysArray = keysFolder:GetChildren()

   local function partTouched(otherPart, keyPart)
      local whichCharacter = otherPart.Parent
      local humanoid = whichCharacter:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
      if humanoid then
         -- Give the player a key and destroy the key part
         -- =============================================
         treasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
         -- =============================================
      end
   end
   ```

4. Run the project and check that touching a key destroys it.

   <video controls src="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/get-first-key.mp4" width="75%"></video>

### Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue:** Get an error message including: `"Infinite yield possible"`.

- Check the spelling of your module script in a script. If a module script, like _TreasureManager_, is spelled differently, there will be an error.

**Issue:** Get an error message including: `"attempt to index global"`.

- Check the line that includes the require for the module script in _keyScript_. If the module does not include require, it can't use functions and variables from that module script.

**Issue:** Script doesn't run or can't pick up keys.

- In the module script, make sure that all the code is between `local TreasureManager = {}` and `return TreasureManager`. The return must be the last line of code in a Module Script.

- Check that there are two parenthesis at the end of the line with require, like in `WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))`.

## Create a Local Function

Right now, a leaderboard keeps track of a player's keys and treasure. To change the leaderboard numbers, use a local function in the module script. A local function is used because changing a player's key or treasure values will only be needed in the TreasureManager script, not anywhere else.

1. In **ServerStorage**, open the _TreasureManager_ script.

2. Create local variables to do the following:

   - Get the Players service so the script can work with player's leaderboard stats.

   - Store the number of keys the player receives after touching _keyPart_.

   ```lua
   local TreasureManager = {}
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local keyDrop = 1

   ------------------ Local Functions

   ------------------ Module Functions
   function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
      keyPart:Destroy()
   end

   return TreasureManager
   ```

3. Copy and paste these two local functions into the **Local Functions** section.

   - `getPlayerKeys()` returns the value of the player's `Lockpicks` leaderstat.

   - `getPlayerTreasure()` returns the value of the player's `Treasure` leaderstat.

   ```lua
   ------------------ Local Functions
   local function getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
      local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
      return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Lockpicks")
   end
   local function getPlayerTreasure(whichCharacter)
      local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
      local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
      return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Treasure")
   end
   ------------------ Module Functions
   ```

4. To add to the player's keys, in the `getKey()` module function:

   - Create a `local` variable to call `getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)`.

   - Add the value of `keyDrop` to `playerKeys`.

   ```lua
   ------------------ Module Functions
   function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
      local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      playerKeys.Value = playerKeys.Value + keyDrop
      keyPart:Destroy()
   end
   ```

5. Run the project. Check that touching a key destroys it and adds 1 to the player's keys in the leaderboard.

   <img src="../../../assets/education/coding-6/creating-with-module-scripts/show-leaderboard-key.jpg" />

If needed, check your script against the one below for any troubleshooting issues.

```lua title = "Current TreasureManager Script"
local TreasureManager = {}
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local keyDrop = 1

------------------ Local Functions
local function getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
   local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
   return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Lockpicks")
end

local function getPlayerTreasure(whichCharacter)
   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
   local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
   return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Treasure")
end

------------------ Module Functions
function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
   local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
   playerKeys.Value = playerKeys.Value + keyDrop
   keyPart:Destroy()
end

return TreasureManager
```

## Getting Information From Module Scripts

The _TreasureManager_ module script will be used when players touch a treasure chest to check if they have at least one key before opening it and giving them gold.

### Check If Chests Can Be Opened

1. First in **ServerStorage** > _TreasureManager_ script, set up variables for how many keys it costs to open a chest, and how much gold each chest contains.

   ```lua
   local TreasureManager = {}

   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local keyDrop = 1
   local chestPickCost = 1
   local chestReward = 100

   ------------------ Local Functions
   local function getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
      local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
      return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Lockpicks")
   end
   ```

2. To create a function that checks if a player can open a chest, in the **Module Functions** section, add a new function to the `TreasureManager` table named `canOpenChest()` with the parameter `whichCharacter`.

   ```lua
   ------------------ Module Functions
   function TreasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)

   end

   function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
      local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      playerKeys.Value = playerKeys.Value + keyDrop
      keyPart:Destroy()
   end
   ```

3. Copy and paste the code below into `canOpenChest()` to return `true` if the player has enough keys, and `false` if they don't.

   ```lua
   function TreasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)
      local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      if playerKeys.Value >= chestPickCost then
         return true
      else
         return false
      end
   end
   ```

### Give Players Treasure

So the player can open a chest, create a function in _TreasureManager_ that awards them treasure.

1. Add a new module function to `TreasureManager` named `openChest()`.

   Pass in two arguments:

   - `chestPart` - the chest part to destroy.
   - `whichCharacter` - the player to give treasure.

   ```lua
   function TreasureManager.openChest(chestPart, whichCharacter)

   end
   ```

2. To subtract a player's keys and award them treasure, copy and paste the code below in `openChest()`. This code uses the variables created previously, like `chestReward`, the amount of treasure given per chest.

   ```lua
   function TreasureManager.openChest(chestPart, whichCharacter)
      local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
      local playerTreasure = getPlayerTreasure(whichCharacter)
      playerKeys.Value = playerKeys.Value - chestPickCost
      playerTreasure.Value = playerTreasure.Value + chestReward
      chestPart:Destroy()
   end
   ```

### Call the Chest Functions

Now that the two module functions, `canOpenChest()` and `openChest()`, have been created, they can be called by the Chest parts whenever a player touches them using the premade `partTouched()` function.

1. In **Workspace** > _Chests_ open _ChestScript_.

2. Create a new variable named `treasureManager` and require the _TreasureManager_ module script in **ServerStorage**.

   ```lua
   local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
   -- Require the module script below
   local treasureManager = require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))

   local chests = script.Parent
   local chestsFolder = chests.Parts
   local chestsArray = chestsFolder:GetChildren()
   ```

3. In `partTouched()`, under the `if humanoid` statement, create a new variable named `canOpen` and set it equal to:

   `treasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)`

   ```lua
   local function partTouched(otherPart, chestPart)
     local whichCharacter = otherPart.Parent
     local humanoid = whichCharacter:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
     if humanoid then
       -- Check if the player can open a chest, then let them get treasure
       -- =============================================
       local canOpen = treasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)
       -- =============================================
     end
   end
   ```

4. Next, create an if statement to check if `canOpen` is true.

   - If so, call the TreasureManager's `openChest()` function.

   - Then, pass in two parameters: `chestPart`, the chest to destroy, and `whichCharacter`, the player to award treasure.

   ```lua
   local function partTouched(otherPart, chestPart)
      local whichCharacter = otherPart.Parent
      local humanoid = whichCharacter:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
      if humanoid then
         -- Check if the player can open a chest, then let them get treasure
         -- =============================================
         local canOpen = treasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)
         if canOpen == true then
            treasureManager.openChest(chestPart, whichCharacter)
         end
         -- =============================================
      end
   end
   ```

5. Run the project. Check that:

   - If you have at least 1 key, touching a chest will destroys it and awards treasure.
   - If you have 0 keys, you can't open a treasure chest.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- In _ChestScript_, make sure that functions called from the module script like `canOpenChest()` are spelled exactly how they're found in the _TreasureManager_ script. Any difference will cause an error.

- Check that copy and pasted functions, like `treasureManager.openChest()`, are exactly as shown in the lesson. Any differences can cause subtle errors in the script.

## Finished Scripts

```lua title='Finished TreasureManager Script'

local TreasureManager = {}
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local chestPickCost = 1
local chestReward = 100

   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
   local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
   return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Lockpicks")
end

local function getPlayerTreasure(whichCharacter)
   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(whichCharacter)
   local leaderstats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
   return leaderstats:WaitForChild("Treasure")
end

------------------ Module Functions

   playerTreasure.Value = playerTreasure.Value + chestReward
   chestPart:Destroy()
end

function TreasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)
   local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
   if playerKeys.Value >= chestPickCost then
   return true
   else
   return false
   end
end

function TreasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
   local playerKeys = getPlayerKeys(whichCharacter)
   playerKeys.Value = playerKeys.Value + keyDrop
   keyPart:Destroy()
end

return TreasureManager
```

```lua title='Finished ChestScript'
local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
-- Require the module script below ⯆
local treasureManager = require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))

local chests = script.Parent

local chestsArray = chestsFolder:GetChildren()

local function partTouched(otherPart, chestPart)
   local whichCharacter = otherPart.Parent
   local humanoid = whichCharacter:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
   if humanoid then
      -- Check if the player can open a chest, then let them get treasure
      -- =============================================
      local canOpen = treasureManager.canOpenChest(whichCharacter)
      if canOpen == true then
         treasureManager.openChest(chestPart, whichCharacter)
      end
      -- =============================================
   end
end

-- Binds every chest part to the touch function so it works on all parts
for chestIndex = 1, #chestsArray do
   local chestPart = chestsArray[chestIndex]
   chestPart.Touched:Connect(function(otherPart)
   partTouched(otherPart, chestPart)
   end)
end
```

```lua title='Finished keyScript'
local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
-- Require the module script below ⯆
local treasureManager = require(ServerStorage:WaitForChild("TreasureManager"))

local keys = script.Parent
local keysFolder = keys.Parts
local keysArray = keysFolder:GetChildren()

local function partTouched(otherPart, keyPart)
   local whichCharacter = otherPart.Parent
   local humanoid = whichCharacter:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")
   if humanoid then
      -- Give the player a key and destroy the key part
      -- =============================================
      treasureManager.getKey(keyPart, whichCharacter)
      -- =============================================
   end
end

-- Binds every key part to the touch function so it works on all parts
for keyIndex = 1, #keysArray do
   local keyPart = keysArray[keyIndex]
   keyPart.Touched:Connect(function(otherPart)
      partTouched(otherPart, keyPart)
   end)
end
```

## Summary

A common application of using module scripts in Roblox games is to handle common tasks used by players, such as granting them points. For this example, a module script named TreasureManager was created to handle giving players keys and treasure whenever they interact with in-game objects.
