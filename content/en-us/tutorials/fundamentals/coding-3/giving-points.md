This project will use conditional statements to create a part that will give or subtract points on a leaderboard depending on what color the part is when touched. If blue, then it'll give players a few points. If green, then it'll give a lot of points. Finally, if red, then it'll take away points.

## Setting up the Project

The point giving part can be added into any project where points are relevant. For instance, an adventure game where players collect points.

### Point Tracking

To setup this project, you'll need a leaderboard to track the points and a part that changes colors. Code for the leaderboard will be provided.

1. Create a new script in **ServerScriptService** named Leaderboard. Copy and paste the code below into the script.

   ```lua
   --In ServerScriptService, create a script named PlayerSetup with the contents below.

   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local function onPlayerJoin(player)
   	local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
   	leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
   	leaderstats.Parent = player

   	-- Example of an IntValue
   	local points = Instance.new("IntValue")
   	points.Name = "Points"
   	points.Value = 0
   	points.Parent = leaderstats
   end

   -- Run onPlayerJoin when the PlayerAdded event fires
   Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerJoin)
   ```

### Color Changing Part

The script will cycle through three different colors for the part. Each color will have a variable to store it's RGB value, a data type that includes a set of three numbers (red, green, blue) that create colors.

1. Create a part named PointPart with an attached script named PointScript.
2. In PointScript, use `script.Parent` to refer to the part.

   ```lua
   local pointPart = script.Parent
   ```

3. Create variables to store the different colors. Each variable should be set to `Datatype.Color3.fromRGB()`, which creates a color value.

   - **Blue** (Some Points): (0, 0, 255)
   - **Green** (Many Points): (0, 255, 0)
   - **Red** (Lose Points): (255, 0, 0)

   ```lua
   local pointPart = script.Parent

   -- Colors
   local blue = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)
   local green = Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)
   local red = Color3.fromRGB(255 ,0, 0)
   ```

4. Add variables for a small amount of points, a larger amount of points, and a third for removing points.

   ```lua
   -- Colors
   local blue = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)
   local green = Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)
   local red = Color3.fromRGB(255 ,0, 0)

   -- Points values
   local smallPoints = 10
   local largePoints = 50
   local losePoints = 100
   ```

### Adding the Players Service

To award points, you'll need to get access to the player's information which is stored in the Explorer under Players, and is separate from the character object. This is where information like leaderboard stats can be found.

You can do so by adding the **Players** service to your script. **Services** are additional sets of pre-built functions made by Roblox engineers to save you time.

1. Get the **Players** service by typing: `local Players = game:GetService("Players")`

   ```lua
   -- Points values
   local smallPoints = 10
   local largePoints = 50
   local losePoints = 100

   -- Services needed
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   ```

### Functions and Events

PointsScript will need two functions. The first function will give and subtract parts. The second function will check if a player has touched the part. These functions will then be connected with a touch event, which runs whenever that part is touched.

1. Create a new function named `givePoints()` and a parameter named `player`. Inside, add a print statement to use for testing.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   -- Gives or subtracts points
   local function givePoints(player)
   	print("Giving player points")
   end
   ```

2. Under that, create a second function named `partTouched()` with a parameter named `otherPart`.

   ```lua
   -- Gives or subtracts points
   local function givePoints(player)
   	print("Giving player points")
   end

   -- Checks if player touched the part
   local function partTouched(otherPart)

   end
   ```

3. Inside the function, use the function `GetPlayerFromCharacter()` to check if there's a player in the otherPart variable.

   ```lua
   -- Checks if player touched the part
   local function partTouched(otherPart)
   	local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(otherPart.Parent)
   end
   ```

4. If a player touched the part, it'll be stored inside the player variable. If not, the variable will stay empty. On your own:

   - Inside the function, check if player has a value. If there is, then call `givePoints(player)`.
   - Beneath the function, connect `partTouched()` to `pointPart`'s Touched event.

   ```lua
   -- Checks if player touched the part
   local function partTouched(otherPart)
   	-- Gets the player if one touched the part
   	local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(otherPart.Parent)
   	if player then
   		givePoints(player)
   	end
   end

   pointPart.Touched:Connect(partTouched)
   ```

5. **Run** the project. Whenever a player touches the part, you should see a message in the Output Window saying: `"Giving player points"`

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

- Check that `"Players"` in `game:GetService("Players")` is capitalized and in quotations.
- `partTouched()` should be connected to pointPart's `Touched` event.

## Create Looping Colors

To loop through colors, the script will use a while =loop that changes the part's color every few seconds. The condition for this loop will be true, so it can run indefinitely.

1. At the end of the script, create a new while loop where the condition is true, meaning the loop always runs.

   ```lua
   -- Checks if player touched the part
   local function partTouched(otherPart)
   	-- Gets the player if one touched the part
   	local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(otherPart.Parent)
   	if player then
   		givePoints(player)
   	end
   end

   pointPart.Touched:Connect(partTouched)

   -- Loops through colors
   while true do

   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   If the while true do loop is not at the bottom of the script, any code below it will never be run. Since the while loop doesn't stop, it'll keep running the loop instead of any code below it.
   </Alert>

2. On your own, code a while true do loop that changes pointPart to the color variables you've created. Don't forget to use `Library.task.wait()` between colors. When finished, check your code against the version below.

   ```lua
   -- Loops through 3 colors, waiting between each color
   while true do
     pointPart.Color = blue
     task.wait(3)
     pointPart.Color = green
     task.wait(2)
     pointPart.Color = red
     task.wait(1)
   end
   ```

3. Play-test and check that all three colors loop without stopping.

### Troubleshooting Tips

At this point, if the color looping doesn't work as intended, try one of the following below.

- Check that the while loop is at the **bottom** of the script, below the Touched event. If the loop is not at the bottom, it'll keep other parts of the script from running correctly.
- Check that each color inside `Datatype.Color3.fromRGB()` is correctly written. There must be three numbers between 0 and 255 separated by commas, like `(255, 50, 0)`.

## Giving Players Points

Players will be given points based on the current color of the part when they touch it.

### Finding the Current Color

Whenever a player touches the part, the script will need to know the current color of the part to award points later.

1. Find `givePoints()`. Replace your testing message with a variable for the current color of pointPart. This variable will determine how many points the player gets (or loses).

   ```lua
   local function givePoints(player)
   	local currentColor = pointPart.Color
   end
   ```

2. To affect a player's points, that function needs access to the player's leaderboard. Create a variable to store it.

   ```lua
   local function givePoints(player)
   	local currentColor = pointPart.Color

   	local playerStats = player:WaitForChild("leaderstats")
   end
   ```

3. Now add a variable to get the player's Points value, which is a child of their leaderboard.

   ```lua
   local function givePoints(player)
   	local currentColor = pointPart.Color

   	local playerStats = player:WaitForChild("leaderstats")
   	local playerPoints= playerStats:WaitForChild("Points")
   end
   ```

### Giving or Subtracting Points

Next, you'll use if and elseif to give or subtract points depending on the color of the part when touched. Remember that blue provides a small amount, green provides many, and red subtracts points.

1. Inside `givePoints()`, beneath the variables, use an if statement to check if the current color is blue and if so then add `smallPoints` to the player's current points value.

   ```lua
   local function givePoints(player)
   	local currentColor = pointPart.Color

   	local playerStats = player:WaitForChild("leaderstats")
   	local playerPoints= playerStats:WaitForChild("Points")

   	if currentColor == blue then
   		playerPoints.Value += smallPoints
   	end
   end
   ```

2. To check for green, add an else if condition. If green, then add the `largePoints` variable to the player's points.

   ```lua
   if currentColor == blue then
   	playerPoints.Value += smallPoints
   elseif currentColor == green then
   	playerPoints.Value += largePoints
   end
   ```

3. Use an else statement to subtract points if pointsPart was neither blue nor green.

   ```lua
   if currentColor == blue then
   	playerPoints.Value += smallPoints
   elseif currentColor == green then
   	playerPoints.Value += largePoints
   else
   	playerPoints.Value -= losePoints
   end
   ```

4. Lastly, **destroy** the part after the if statement so that the script can't keep giving out points.

   ```lua
   if currentColor == blue then
   	playerPoints.Value += smallPoints
   elseif currentColor == green then
   	playerPoints.Value += largePoints
   else
   	playerPoints.Value -= losePoints
   end

   pointPart:Destroy()
   ```

5. Playtest and check that each color gives points as expected. Be sure to test all **three** conditions.

## Giving Players Feedback

The PointPart works, but players might not notice something happened unless they happen to be looking at their leaderboard. Fix that by creating particles when the PointPart is destroyed.

Adding feedback when players use a part, like sounds, shakes, or particles, makes interactions with objects more satisfying to players.

### Creating a Particle Effect

The particle effect will be the same color as the part when touched. Since the colors were stored in variables, it's easy to reuse them.

1. In `givePoints()` at the bottom, create a new **ParticleEmitter** instance. Make sure the instance name is spelled exactly as shown.

   ```lua
   	local particle = Instance.new("ParticleEmitter")
   end
   ```

2. ParticleEmitters use color sequences to control their Color property. Create a new ColorSequence and pass in the current part color.

   ```lua
   -- Destroy part
   pointPart:Destroy()

   -- Create particles
   local particle = Instance.new("ParticleEmitter")
   particle.Color = ColorSequence.new(currentColor)
   ```

3. The particle will need to be parented to player that touched it. Create a variable to get the player's Character model. Then, parent the particle to the player's head.

   ```lua
   local particle = Instance.new("ParticleEmitter")
   particle.Color = ColorSequence.new(currentColor)

   local playerCharacter = player.Character
   particle.Parent = playerCharacter:WaitForChild("Head")
   ```

4. Use `Library.task.wait()` for a quick second, then destroy the particles.

   ```lua
   local particle = Instance.new("ParticleEmitter")
   particle.Color = ColorSequence.new(currentColor)

   local playerCharacter = player.Character
   particle.Parent = playerCharacter:WaitForChild("Head")

   task.wait(1)
   particle:Destroy()
   ```

5. Playtest the game and make sure particles briefly follow the player after touching each color.

### Troubleshooting Tips

At this point, if particles doesn't work as intended, try one of the following below.

- Make when creating a new instance that ParticleEmitter is spelled **exactly** as shown and inside quotations.
- When parenting the particles, make sure to use `:` between `playerCharacter` and `WaitForChild()` with no spaces between.

## Complete PointScript

A finished version of the script can be referenced below.

```lua
local pointPart = script.Parent
--local storage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")

-- Gives some points
local blue = Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)
-- Gives more points
local green = Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)
-- Makes players lose points
local red = Color3.fromRGB(255 ,0, 0)

-- gold given to players
local smallPoints = 10
local largePoints = 50
local losePoints = 100

local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local function givePoints(player)
	local currentColor = pointPart.Color

	local playerStats = player:WaitForChild("leaderstats")
	local playerPoints = playerStats:WaitForChild("Points")
	
	-- Gives player gold based on the color of the part
	if currentColor == blue then
		playerPoints.Value += smallPoints
	elseif currentColor == green then
		playerPoints.Value += largePoints
	else
		playerPoints.Value -= losePoints
	end

	-- Destroy the part, wait a second, and thne destroy the particle
	pointPart:Destroy()
	
	-- Creates a sparkles effect and destroys it
	local playerCharacter = player.Character
	local particle = Instance.new("ParticleEmitter")
	particle.Color = ColorSequence.new(currentColor)
	particle.Parent = playerCharacter:WaitForChild("Head")
	task.wait(1)
	particle:Destroy()
end

local function partTouched(otherPart)
	local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(otherPart.Parent)

	if player then
		givePoints(player)
	end
end

pointPart.Touched:Connect(partTouched)

-- Changes the color of the part based on variables. Needs to be at bottom of script.
while true do
	pointPart.Color = blue
	task.wait(4)
	pointPart.Color = green
	task.wait(3)
	pointPart.Color = red
	task.wait(2)
end
```
