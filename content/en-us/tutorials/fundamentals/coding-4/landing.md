### Series Description

In computer science, loops are a common feature in many scripts, often used to repeat sets of code. This series will cover two of the most common loops: for and while loops.

### Objectives and Prerequisites

<table>
<tbody>
   <tr>
    <td width="20%"><b>Learning Objectives</b></td>

    Be able to write out for and while loops, while identifying the syntax for both.
    </td>

   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><b>Prerequisites</b></td>
    <td>
    Have a general understanding of variables in Lua.
