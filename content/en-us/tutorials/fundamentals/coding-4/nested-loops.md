Nesting loops allows you to repeat tasks in batches. For example, baking three batches of six cupcakes, or assigning weapons to players on two teams.

## How Nested Loops Run

When loops are nested, scripts go line by line until it reaches the next loop. The inner loop will run until it's condition is met before returning to the outer loop.

### Nested Loop Logic

The following diagram shows the steps a loop takes.

<table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>
  <ul>
  <li>Outer loop: code runs line-by-line until it reaches the inner loop.</li>
  <li>Outer loop: code runs line-by-line until it reaches the inner loop.</li>
  <li>Outer loop: code runs line-by-line until it reaches the inner loop.</li>
  </ul>

### Nested Loop Example

Nested loops can seem somewhat abstract, so a visual example can help. For this exercise, copy and paste a sample script and run it in Studio. This script will create towers of parts. The outer loop will control how many parts to make, while the inner loop will create the actual batch.

1. Create a new script in **ServerScriptService** named PartMaker. Copy the code below.

   ```lua
   local numberOfBatches = 7
   local partsPerBatch = 5
   local partsMade = 0

   -- Makes a single  cube
   local function createPart()
     local part= Instance.new("Part")
     part.Size = Vector3.new(2, 2, 2)
     part.CFrame = CFrame.new(20, 0, 20)
     part.Color = currentColor
     part.Parent = workspace
   end

   -- Outer loop
   for partBatch = 1, numberOfBatches do
     print ("Top outer loop: part batch " .. partBatch)
     currentColor = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0, 255),math.random(0, 255),math.random(0, 255))

     -- Inner loop
     for partNumber = 1, partsPerBatch do
       createPart()
       print("Inner loop: part " .. partNumber)
       -- Track parts baked
       partsMade = partsMade + 1
       task.wait(.5)
     end

     print("Bottom outer loop: " .. partsMade .. " parts made so far.")

     task.wait(2)
   end
   ```

2. Watch as the script spawns a different batch of colored parts. After going through one batch, it'll pause for 2 seconds. The print statement in the outer loop will run only one time per completed inner loop.

## Nested For Loop Tower

Each loop has its own set of code, so can be responsible for different tasks. One thing nested loops can do is change the placement of where an object spawns to create a tower like the one in this video. There's three different loops, one each for controlling where along the width, length, and height of the tower the cube spawns.

## Coding a Cube Maker Script

To practice nested loops, you'll make a script that creates a tower of cubes. For the cube tower script, first code a function that spawns a single cube. The tower will be built by repeatedly calling this function.

### Setting up the Script

For the cube tower script, first code a function that spawns a single cube. The tower will be built by repeatedly calling this function.

1. **Delete** the PartMaker script or disable it (in the script properties, check Disabled). If you don't, there will be two scripts making parts at the same time in the same place.

2. Create a new script named TowerBuilder. Add variables for tower size and cube size at the top.

   ```lua
   local TOWER_SIZE = 4
   local CUBE_Sï»¿IZE = 2
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   Notice how the variables above are all capitalized. These are called **constants**, or variables that don't change. To set them apart from variables that will be changed within the script, type them using capitals and underscores.
   </Alert>

3. Add a local function named `makecube()` that creates a single square cube using `CUBE_SIZE`.

   ```lua
   local TOWER_SIZE = 4
   local CUBE_SIZE = 2

   -- Creates individual cubes
   local function makecube()
     local cube = Instance.new("Part")
     cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
   end
   ```

4. Set the cube's color to a variable which will be updated in the nested loops.

   ```lua
   local function makecube()
     local cube = Instance.new("Part")
     cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
     cube.Color = currentColor
   end
   ```

5. Lastly, **parent** the new cube to the workspace so it appears.

   ```lua
   local function makeCube()
       local cube= Instance.new("Part")
       cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
       cube.Color = currentColor
       cube.Parent = workspace
   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   In Roblox code, once an object is created by script, it's recommended to parent it at the end. It's faster to make changes to an instance before there is a physical object in the game world.
   </Alert>

### Spawning in Different Directions

To create a tower, spawn cubes at specific points by setting the X, Y, Z properties of each new cube. X and Z are side to side. Y is up and down.

1. In `makecube()`, add parameters for `spawnX`, `spawnY`, and `spawnZ`. These numbers will set each new cube's spawn location.

   ```lua
   -- Creates individual cubes
   local function makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
       local cube = Instance.new("Part")
       cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
       cube.Color = currentColor
       cube.Parent = workspace
   end
   ```

2. Inside the function, set the cube's CFrame property to a new CFrame using the `spawnX`, `spawnY`, `spawnZ` parameters.

   ```lua
   local function makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
       local cube = Instance.new("Part")
       cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
       cube.Color = currentColor
       cube.CFrame = CFrame.new(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
       cube.Parent = workspace
   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   In Roblox, CFrame is a data type used to store 3D position and orientation. It's used to place objects in a world.
   </Alert>

### Spawning with Nested Loops

The script will have three loops total, one each for the length, width, and height of the tower. To complete an entire floor before moving upwards, start with setting the Y coordinate in the first, outermost loop.

1. Under the `makeCube()` function, Create a for loop to set how **high** each cube spawns.

   - **Control variable**: `heightIndex = 1`
   - **End point**: `TOWER_SIZE`
   - Inside the loop, add: local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) \* CUBE_SIZE

   ```lua
   -- Builds tower
   for heightIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
       local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) * CUBE_SIZE
   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
   The calculation for `spawnY` makes sure the first cube spawns at ground height and then moves over the space of a single cube every time. Ground level is at 0, which is why 1 needs to be subtracted from the `heightIndex`.
   </Alert>

2. With the first loop for height finished, start on the second. Inside the first for loop, add a new for loop for where to place the cube along the length of the tower.

   - **Control variable**: lengthIndex = 1
   - **End point**: `TOWER_SIZE`
   - Inside that loop add: local spawnX = lengthIndex \* CUBE_SIZE

   ```lua
   for heightIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
       local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) * CUBE_SIZE

       for lengthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
     local spawnX = lengthIndex * CUBE_SIZE

       end
   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="warning">
   When working with nested loops, it's important to make sure code is well indented. This helps make your code readable and organized.
   </Alert>

3. Inside the **second** loop, add a **third** for loop for the tower **width**. In this final loop, call `makecube()` and pass in the X,Y, Z parameters.

   - **Control variable**: `widthIndex = 1`
   - **End point**: `TOWER_SIZE`
   - Inside the loop add:
     - `local spawnZ = widthIndex * CUBE_SIZE`
     - `makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)`
     - A wait time of 0.25 so you can watch the tower be built.

   ```lua
   -- Builds tower
   for heightIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
       local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) * CUBE_SIZE

       for lengthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
     local spawnX = lengthIndex * CUBE_SIZE

           for widthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
         local spawnZ = widthIndex * CUBE_SIZE
         makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
         task.wait(0.25)
     end
       end
   end
   ```

4. To have each floor be a random color, change `currentColor` to random `RGB` numbers in the same loop in which you create a new floor.

   ```lua
   for heightIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
       local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) * CUBE_SIZE
       currentColor = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255))
       for lengthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
           local spawnX = lengthIndex * CUBE_SIZE
           for widthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
               local spawnZ = widthIndex * CUBE_SIZE
               makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
               task.wait(0.25)
           end
       end
   end
   ```

5. Run the project and wait to see that a full tower has been created without any errors in the Output Window.

## Optional Challenges

Below are different self-directed challenges that use nested loops in different ways. Try and code on your own before looking at the solution.

### Fade Away Parts

As the tower is built, have the parts fade in transparency from left to right.

<img src="../../../assets/education/coding-4/Fade_480x320.png" width="60%" />

The code solution is below.

```lua
local TOWER_SIZE = 6
local CUBE_SIZE = 2

-- Creates individual cubes
local function makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
    local cube = Instance.new("Part")
    cube.Size = Vector3.new(CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE, CUBE_SIZE)
    cube.Color =  currentColor
	cube.Transparency = cubeTransparency -- Sets transparency
	cube.CFrame = CFrame.new(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
    cube.Parent = workspace
end

-- Builds tower
for heightIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
    local spawnY = (heightIndex - 1) * CUBE_SIZE
    currentColor = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255), math.random(0, 255))

    for lengthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
        local spawnX = lengthIndex * CUBE_SIZE
		cubeTransparency = (lengthIndex - 1) * 0.10 --Updates every loop starting at 0


        for widthIndex = 1, TOWER_SIZE do
            local spawnZ = widthIndex * CUBE_SIZE
            makecube(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ)
            task.wait(0.05)
        end
    end
end
```

### Rain Down Objects

Instead of parts, try spawning an actual object. The example here used cupcakes.

On your own, see if you can:

- Create an object from base parts. Make sure to weld all parts together so the object doesn't fall apart.
- Place the object in ServerStorage
- Modify the PartMaker found in the [Nested Loop Example](#nested-loop-example)to use your object instead of parts.

A sample is shown here.

<video controls src="../../../assets/education/coding-4/CupCakeBloopers_Compressed.mp4" width="100%"></video>

A code solution using cupcakes is included.

```lua
local numberOfBatches = 30
local cupcakesPerBatch = 6

local cupcakesBaked = 0

--Makes a single cupcake
local function makeCupcake()
		local serverStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
		local cupcake = serverStorage.Cupcake:Clone()
		local cup = cupcake.Cup
		local frosting = cupcake.Frosting
		cupcake:SetPrimaryPartCFrame(CFrame.new(0,20, 0) *CFrame.Angles(0, 0, -90))
		frosting.Color = frostingColor
		cup.Color = cupColor
		cupcake.Parent = workspace
end


-- Outer loop
for cupcakeBatch = 1, numberOfBatches do
	print ("Top outer loop: cupcake batch " .. cupcakeBatch)
	frostingColor = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0,255),math.random(0,255),math.random(0,255))
	cupColor = Color3.fromRGB(math.random(0,255),math.random(0,255),math.random(0,255))

	-- Inner loop
	for cupcakeNumber = 1, cupcakesPerBatch do
		makeCupcake()
		print("Inner loop: cupcake " .. cupcakeNumber)
	 -- Track muffins baked
		cupcakesBaked = cupcakesBaked + 1
		task.wait(.5)
end

print("Bottom outer loop: " .. cupcakesBaked .. " cupcakes baked so far.")
end
```

## Summary

To accomplish more complex tasks, coders will find it helpful to combine multiple loops, and even different types of loops. All loops can be nested, meaning that one loop is inside another. Nested loops follow the same logic as any other loop. It starts in the first, outermost loop, runs tasks through inner loops, and then cycles back to the first loop if applicable.
