### Series description

Start coding on Roblox with this easy-to-follow series covering the fundamentals of how to use the programming language Luau. These courses are perfect for those new to coding or just starting with Luau. Each course centers around a foundational computer science principle, and features individual lessons with step-by-step tutorials you can use to create your own experiences on Roblox.

Before beginning this course, the reader should have basic knowledge of Roblox Studio, as demonstrated in the [Studio](../../curriculums/studio/index.md) and [Building](../../curriculums/building/index.md) lesson.

<tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>[Variables and objects](landing.md)</td>
    <td> Create your first script and start making things happen with code. These tutorials cover variables, data types, and properties.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>[Functions and events](../coding-2/functions-and-events.md)</td>
    <td>Use functions to create chunks of code that run only when you tell it. Connect your code to in-world events to create interactive objects like traps or bridges.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>[Conditionals](../coding-3/landing.md)</td>
    <td>Conditionals use the coding pattern of "if this happens then do that." Apply this pattern to check if the time is right to unlock power ups for your players.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>[Loops](../coding-4/landing.md)</td>
    <td>Learn how to repeat code a certain amount of time or make it run forever using for and while loops. Practice using these loop types to code timed bridges and flashing lights.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>[Dictionaries and arrays](../coding-5/landing.md)</td>
    <td>Learn how to store a lot of data in a single variable using tables and arrays. Data structures such as these can store large data sets like a player's inventory.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>[Organize code](../coding-6/landing.md)</td>
    <td>Take your code organization a step further and learn about module scripts, a unique type of script that can interact with other scripts in Luau.</td>
   </tr>
