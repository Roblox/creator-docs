In [Deadly Lava](../../../tutorials/scripting/basic-scripting/deadly-lava.md), you learned how to trigger code based on user behavior. This tutorial shows you how to make a platform which fades away when a user steps on it.

## Setting Up

If you followed [Deadly Lava](../../../tutorials/scripting/basic-scripting/deadly-lava.md), you can place your fading platform above the lava floor that users can't jump across.

1. Insert a part and move it into place in your world. Name it `FadingPlatform`.
2. Resize it so a user can jump on it.
3. Make sure it's **Anchored**.

4. Insert a **Script** into the part, rename it to **FadeOnTouch**, and remove the default code.

5. Create a variable for the platform and an empty function connected to the platform's `Touched` event.

   ```lua
   local platform = script.Parent

   local function fade()

   end

   platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
   ```

## Fading the Platform

Having the platform vanish in an instant would be no fun at all as users would find it impossible to get across the gap. Instead, the platform should **fade away** before users fall through it to give them a chance to jump off.

You could change the `Transparency` property and wait a very short time over and over again to get this effect, but a gradual fade would require at least 10 changes between 0 and 1. That's 20 lines of very repetitive code.

This can be achieved much more effectively using a **for** loop which repeats code a specific number of times. Each loop of the code is known as an **iteration**. A for loop is defined with three things, separated by commas:

![](../../../assets/tutorials/fading-trap/forLoop.jpg)

- **Control variable** - The variable created and used to count the loops. In this example, it's `count` and the starting value is 1.
- **End value** - The value it has to get to for the loop to stop. In this example, it's 10.
- **Step increment** (optional) - Determines what to add to the control variable each loop. If left out, it defaults to 1, so in this example it's unnecessary.

In **FadeOnTouch**:

1. In the function, create a `for` loop starting from `1` which iterates `10` times.
2. Inside the for loop, set the `Transparency` property to the control variable divided by `10`.
3. Call the `task.wait` function with a time of `0.1`.

   ```lua
   local platform = script.Parent

   local function fade()
   	for count = 1, 10 do
   		platform.Transparency = count / 10
   		task.wait(0.1)
   	end
   end

   platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
   ```

When the loop runs, count increases by 1 with each iteration. This means that the platform's `Transparency` will increase by 0.1 every 0.1 seconds, reaching full transparency after 1 second.

## Reappearing

After the platform has vanished, users should fall through it. The platform should also come back a few seconds after it fades - otherwise, users would never get to try the jump again if they failed. The CanCollide property controls whether users can fall through a part.

1. Set the `CanCollide` property of the platform to `false` after the for loop.
2. Wait for a few seconds using the `task.wait` function.
3. Set the `CanCollide` property back to `true`.
4. Set the `Transparency` property back to `0`.

   ```lua
   local platform = script.Parent

   local function fade()
      for count = 1, 10 do
         platform.Transparency = count / 10
         task.wait(0.1)
      end
      platform.CanCollide = false
      task.wait(3)
      platform.CanCollide = true
      platform.Transparency = 0
   end

   platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
   ```

## Debounce Variable

In [Deadly Lava](../../../tutorials/scripting/basic-scripting/deadly-lava.md), you learned that the `Touched` event runs each time a user's body part comes into contact with the part. This behavior causes issues when a user runs across the fading platform: the function will run multiple times, resetting the loop each time.

For the code to work properly, the function should only run once when the user touches the platform for the first time. Ensuring that an action is only triggered once when it would otherwise be triggered multiple times is known as **debouncing**.

To debounce a function, a [boolean](../../../luau/booleans.md) variable can be used to keep track of when the platform has already been touched. Booleans can only contain **true** and **false** values. Create a variable called `isTouched` and set it to `false`.

```lua
local platform = script.Parent

local isTouched = false

local function fade()
	for count = 1, 10 do
		platform.Transparency = count / 10
		task.wait(0.1)
	end
	platform.CanCollide = false
	task.wait(3)
	platform.CanCollide = true
	platform.Transparency = 0
end

platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
```

## Checking the Variable

An if statement can be used to only run the code in the fade function if the `isTouched` debouncing variable is false. Wrap the body of the fade function in an `if` statement with the condition `not isTouched`.

```lua
local platform = script.Parent

local isTouched = false

local function fade()
	if not isTouched then
		for count = 1, 10 do
            platform.Transparency = count / 10
            task.wait(0.1)
	    end
		platform.CanCollide = false
		task.wait(3)
		platform.CanCollide = true
		platform.Transparency = 0
	end
end

platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
```

The Lua `not` operator reverses the value of whatever follows it. In conditional terms, this means that the first if statement behaves the same as the statements which follow.

```lua
if not isTouched then

end
if isTouched == false then

end

if isTouched == nil then

end
```

## Toggling the Debounce

Currently, the code in the `fade` function will always run because `isTouched` is false and `not isTouched` evaluates to true. To complete the debounce routine, you'll need to toggle the variable's value in two places.

1. Set `isTouched` to `true` inside the `if` statement, before the platform begins to fade.
2. Set it back to `false` once the platform has reappeared.

```lua
local function fade()
  if not isTouched then
    isTouched = true
    for count = 1, 10 do
      platform.Transparency = count / 10
      task.wait(0.1)
    end
    platform.CanCollide = false
    task.wait(3)
    platform.CanCollide = true
    platform.Transparency = 0
    isTouched = false
  end
end

platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
```

And that's it! Test your code now, and you should find that the platform fades away when the user jumps on it and comes back a few seconds later.

You can duplicate this platform across a wider gap to create a challenging obstacle and change the speed at which they fade to balance the difficulty.

## Final Code

```lua
local platform = script.Parent

local isTouched = false

local function fade()
	if not isTouched then
		isTouched = true
		for count = 1, 10 do
		    platform.Transparency = count / 10
		    task.wait(0.1)
	    end
		platform.CanCollide = false
		task.wait(3)
		platform.CanCollide = true
		platform.Transparency = 0
		isTouched = false
	end
end

platform.Touched:Connect(fade)
```
