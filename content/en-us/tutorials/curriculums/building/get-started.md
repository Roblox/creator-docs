Welcome to your first beginner building lesson in Studio! To get started, let's walk through how to open the sample template, customize Studio's layout for your tasks, and playtest the core gameplay of the experience in which players race through an obstacle course (obby) until they reach the final platform.

## Open template

Templates are pre-made 3D worlds that you can use as the base for your own experiences. To introduce you to building in Studio, Roblox has created the **Classic Obby** template with everything necessary for the experience to work properly, such as the code to run the gameplay and a simple skybox that you can customize at a later time.

For a full list of Roblox-provided templates, see [Templates](../../../resources/templates.md).
</Alert>

Click the following button to open the **Classic Obby** template:

   <UseStudioButton variant="" buttonTextTranslationKey="Action.EditInStudio" placeId="203812057" universeId="93412282" />

## Customize workspace

Roblox Studio launches with extra windows open that you don't need for this lesson. You can close these extra windows to create more space for what you're currently working on.

To customize the workspace for your coding task:

1. Close each window on the **left** of the 3D view by clicking the **&times;** in the window's upper-right corner. If you don't see anything to close on the left, go to the next step.

2. Leave the **Explorer** and **Properties** windows open on the right side of Studio. If you have done each step correctly, Studio looks like the following image.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   If you don't see the **Explorer** and **Properties** windows, open them from Studio's **Window** menu.

## Playtest the experience

Before you start building your obby, it's important to take a moment to playtest the template so you can see how the gameplay works. When players join the experience, they begin in an obstacle course that starts easy and becomes more difficult, including platforms that move, push players high in the air, or set their character's health to zero.

To playtest the experience's gameplay:

1. In the top-left corner of Studio, keep the default **Test** playtest option, then click the **Play** button. Studio enters playtest mode.

   There are a variety of additional playtest options that you will explore in a later chapter of the tutorial.
   </Alert>

1. In the experience, use the following player controls to try to avoid the obstacles and reach the final platform at the end of the course.

     <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>**Action**</th>
         <th>**Control**</th>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>**Move**</td>
         <td><kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> or arrow keys</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>**Rotate**</td>
         <td>Hold the right mouse button and look around.</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>**Pan**</td>
         <td>Hold the middle mouse button to drag your camera around.</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>

1. When you're done, return to the top-left corner of Studio, then click the **Stop** button. Studio exits playtest mode.

Now that you are familiar with the gameplay, it's time to start building your own obby using basic parts!
