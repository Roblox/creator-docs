Congratulations on building your first obby with Roblox Studio! Now that you have experience creating and customizing basic parts with unique visuals and behavior, you can share your creation with others and extend your skills by learning about Studio's additional building features.

## Share with others

When you first publish an experience, it's automatically set to **private** so that you are the only one who can play it. However, creating on Roblox is always more fun when you can share what you make with others, so let's set up your experience so that they can play too.

To make your experience public:

1. Using the steps from the last chapter, publish your experience so others can see your latest changes.

1. In the top-left corner of your computer, click **File** &rang; **Experience Settings**.

1. In the settings window:
   1. Go to the left bar and select the **Permissions** tab. New settings display.
   1. Set **Playability** to **Public**.

1. Click the **Save** button. Now everyone on Roblox can play your experience!

## Continue learning

Basic parts are an excellent start for building in the 3D space, but Studio offers many additional features to create environments in your experiences, including:

- [Materials](../../../parts/materials.md) that change the visual appearance and physical properties of parts.
- [Terrain Editor](../../../parts/terrain.md) that generates realistic terrain environments, such as mountains, grass-covered hills, or a flat desert.
- [Textures and decals](../../../parts/textures-decals.md) that decorate parts with 2D images that either scale or stretch, respectively.
- [Solid modeling operations](../../../parts/solid-modeling.md) that join parts together in unique ways to form more complex shapes known as unions or intersections.
