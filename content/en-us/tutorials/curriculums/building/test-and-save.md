Now that your obstacle course is complete, it's time to playtest your experience to verify that players are able to make it to your final platform, then publish your work to Roblox so that you can save your progress.

## Playtest your obby

It's important to playtest your experience often to ensure that your obby is possible to complete as expected. Studio offers several playtest options:

- **Test** – Starts the playtest by inserting your avatar at a spawn location.
- **Test Here** – Starts the playtest by inserting your avatar in front of the camera's current position.
- **Run** – Starts the playtest without inserting your avatar. Instead, the playtest begins at the current camera position and you can navigate around using the camera controls.

While all options are useful at different times, it's important to use a playtest option that inserts your avatar so that you can test the jump distance between platforms.

To playtest your obby:

1. In the top-left corner of Studio, verify that your playtest is set to either **Test** or **Test Here**, then click the **Play** button. Studio enters playtest mode.

1. In the experience, try to avoid the obstacles and reach the final platform at the end of the course.

1. When you're done, return to the top-left corner of Studio, then click the **Stop** button. Studio exits playtest mode.

## Publish to Roblox

If you were to close Studio now, you would lose every edit you made to your experience. For this reason, it's important to publish your work to Roblox often to save your work and connect the experience to your account.
