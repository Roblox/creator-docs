Using the [Classic Obby](https://www.roblox.com/games/203812057/Classic-Obby) template as a guide, this tutorial acts as an introduction to building in Roblox Studio using basic parts and AI Assistant. As you follow each chapter, you will learn how to create an obstacle course (obby) where players jump across platforms and avoid obstacles until they reach the final platform.

This lesson is intended for readers who are **brand new** to building with parts and working in Studio. If you are familiar with both, try another beginner lesson plan or jump straight to [building your first experience](../core/index.md).
