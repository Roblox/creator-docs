Congratulations on completing your introduction to Roblox Studio! Now that you have Studio on your computer, login credentials, and familiarity with Studio's core user interface, you are ready to start building anything you can imagine.

## New to development?

If you are brand new to development, check out the following beginner tutorials on different development areas that you can specialize in:

- [Building lesson](../building/index.md) — Learn how to **build a simple platformer** using one of Studio's templates.
- [Coding lesson](../coding/index.md) — Learn how to **code an interactive story** where players replace placeholder words with their own answers.
- [VFX lesson](../artist/index.md) — Learn how to **customize special effects art** for a pre-made carnival ride experience.
- [Animation lesson](../animator/index.md) — Learn how to **create keyframes for various poses**, then loop them into a swimming animation that you can reuse in any experience.

After you complete each of these tutorials, you will be ready to [create your first experience](../core/index.md) and learn about [coding fundamentals](../../fundamentals/coding-1/landing.md) for Luau, Studio's programming language.

Game development is a massive field with a lot of different specializations. If one development area doesn't interest you, try another!

## Just new to Studio?

If you aren't new to development, but are new to Studio, check out the following guides for an overview of how experiences technically work:

- [Projects](../../../projects/index.md) — Learn how to create and manage projects in Studio.
- [Assets](../../../projects/assets/index.md) — Learn about how everything in Roblox is represented as a cloud-based asset.
- [Data model](../../../projects/data-model.md) — Learn how places look and function in your experiences.
- [Client-server runtime](../../../projects/client-server.md) — Learn how experiences run in the Cloud.

After you have a solid understanding of these guides, you will be ready to examine the [Plant](../../../resources/plant-reference-project.md) reference project that focuses on common use cases that you might encounter when you develop an experience on Roblox, including tradeoffs, compromises, and the rationale of various implementation choices so that you can make the best decisions for your own experiences.

As you start to build your own experiences, be sure to check out the intermediate tutorials for common use cases, such as:

- [Create HUD meters](../../use-case-tutorials/ui/create-hud-meters.md)
- [Add 3D audio](../../use-case-tutorials/audio/add-3D-audio.md)
- [Save player data](../../use-case-tutorials/data-storage/save-player-data.md)

When you reach a point where you feel comfortable developing in Studio, you will be ready for the advanced paths that offer a deep dive into industry-standard workflows for areas like [environmental art](../environmental-art/index.md), [gameplay scripting](../gameplay-scripting/index.md), and [UI design](../user-interface-design/index.md).
