Welcome to creating on Roblox! Whether you came to this tutorial as a player, a game developer from another engine, or as someone who is brand new to game development, the platform has a spot for you to create anything that you can imagine.

Before you start learning about the Roblox engine, it's important to first create a Roblox account. This process is free and it allows you to access the Roblox app to play experiences, as well as Roblox Studio to build experiences.

To create a Roblox account:

1. Go to Roblox's [home page](https://www.roblox.com/CreateAccount). Because you don't have an account yet, the sign up screen displays.

2. Follow each prompt, then click the **Sign Up** button. After a moment, Roblox logs you in and the home page displays.

With your new account, remember these safety tips:

- **Never share your password** — This tip applies to even real life friends.
- **Make your password hard to guess** — If your username is "bloxcool", your password should not be "bloxcool123".
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** — Report anyone who asks using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203312410) feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** — Never trust players or sites who say they have a way to get free Robux!
