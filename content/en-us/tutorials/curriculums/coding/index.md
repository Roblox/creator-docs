Using the [Story Games](https://www.roblox.com/games/2546610365/Roblox-Creator-Challenge) sample as a guide, this tutorial acts as an introduction to coding in Roblox Studio using the Luau programming language. As you follow each chapter, you will learn how to create a story game where players can replace placeholder words with their own answers.

This lesson is intended for readers who are **brand new** to coding concepts and working in Studio. If you are familiar with both, try another beginner lesson plan or jump straight to [building your first experience](../core/index.md).
