Congratulations on completing your first animation with Roblox Studio! Now that you have experience working with keyframes and posing characters, you can share your work with others and extend your skills by learning about Studio's additional animation features.

## Share with others

When you first publish an experience, it's automatically set to **private** so that you are the only one who can play it. However, creating on Roblox is always more fun when you can share what you make with others, so let's set up your experience so that they can play too.

To make your experience public:

1. Using the steps from the last chapter, publish your experience so others can see your latest changes.

1. In the top-left corner of your computer, click **File** ⟩ **Experience Settings**.

1. In the settings window:
   1. Go to the left bar and select the **Permissions** tab. New settings display.
   1. Set **Playability** to **Public**.

1. Click the **Save** button. Now everyone on Roblox can play your experience!

## Continue learning

The basic **Animation Editor** tools are an excellent start while learning to create animations, but Studio offers many additional animation features to add liveliness to your characters and environment, including:

- [Event markers](../../../animation/events.md) that trigger custom behavior at specific keyframes in an animation.
- [Inverse Kinematics](../../../animation/inverse-kinematics.md) that let you pose and animate multiple character parts by posing or adjusting a single object.

- The [Curve Editor](../../../animation/curve-editor.md) interface that lets you see and modify how a rig's position and orientation changes between keyframes through color-coded curve graphs.
