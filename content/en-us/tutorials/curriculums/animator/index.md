Using the [Island of Move](https://www.roblox.com/games/5306359293/Island-of-Move) sample as a guide, this tutorial acts as an introduction to creating animations in Roblox Studio. As you follow each chapter, you will learn how to create keyframes for various poses, then loop them into a swimming animation that you can reuse in any experience.

This lesson is intended for readers who are **brand new** to creating animations and working in Studio. If you are familiar with both, try another beginner lesson plan or jump straight to [building your first experience](../core/index.md).
