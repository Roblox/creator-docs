In order to start the process of recreating the **Island Jump** [3D platformer experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/14238807008), you must create a project within Roblox Studio. A project is a collection of places, assets, settings and other resources that together represent an experience. You can either start a project from scratch, or you can start with one of Studio's templates to provide a basis for your environment and gameplay mechanics, such as:

- **Baseplate** template — Contains a baseplate and `Class.SpawnLocation` object.
- **Modern City** template — Contains a sample high-quality city and modular asset kit.
- **Laser Tag** template — Contains assets and scripts for a first-person shooter experience.

To create a project with the **Baseplate** template:

1. Open Roblox Studio.
1. In the upper-left corner, click the **New Experience** button. Studio opens a new experience.
1. In the **Explorer** window on the right side of the window, expand the **Workspace** branch and then select the **Baseplate** object.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   If you don't see the **Explorer** window, toggle it on from Studio's **Window** menu.
   </Alert>

1. Press <kbd>Delete</kbd>. The viewport displays an empty world with a spawn location in the middle.

In the next section of the tutorial, you will learn how to use the **Terrain Editor** to create an island environment around the spawn location.
