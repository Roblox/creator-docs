In order to start the process of recreating the **Island Jump** [3D platformer experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/14238807008), you must create a project within Roblox Studio. A project is a collection of places, assets, settings and other resources that together represent an experience. You can either start a project from scratch, or you can start with one of Studio's templates to provide a basis for your environment and gameplay mechanics, such as:

- **Baseplate** template — Contains a baseplate and `Class.SpawnLocation` object.
- **Modern City** template — Contains a sample high-quality city and modular asset kit.
- **Mansion of Wonder** template — Contains assets and scripts for a first-person shooter experience.

To create a project with the **Baseplate** template:

1. Open Roblox Studio.
1. In the vertical navigation bar, select the **New** tab. All templates display.
1. Select the **Baseplate** template. Studio opens a new experience.

1. In the **Explorer** window, right-click the **Baseplate** object. A contextual menu displays.
1. Select **Delete**. The viewport displays an empty world with a spawn location in the middle.

In the next section of the tutorial, you will learn how to use the Terrain Editor to create an island environment around the spawn location.
