The core curriculum helps you learn many essential Studio features across
technical and creative disciplines.

You'll learn how to recreate a simple [3D platformer
experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/14238807008) where players collect
coins to trade for jump power. Players jump to navigate progressively taller
platforms until they reach a flare on top of the highest platform.

This course is intended for readers who are familiar
with general coding concepts but are new to Roblox. If you need help learning
how to code, try the [absolute basics](../../first-experience/index.md) of working in Studio and
[coding fundamentals](../../fundamentals/coding-1/coding-fundamentals.md).
