Congratulations on completing your first VFX art with Roblox Studio! Now that you have experience creating custom special effects with unique visuals and behavior, you can share your art with others and extend your skills by learning about Studio's additional VFX features.

## Share with others

When you first publish an experience, it's automatically set to **private** so that you are the only one who can play it. However, creating on Roblox is always more fun when you can share what you make with others, so let's set up your experience so that they can play too.

To make your experience public:

1. Using the steps from the last chapter, publish your experience so others can see your latest changes.

1. In the top-left corner of your computer, click **File** ⟩ **Experience Settings**.

1. In the settings window:
   1. Go to the left bar and select the **Permissions** tab. New settings display.
   1. Set **Playability** to **Public**.

1. Click the **Save** button. Now everyone on Roblox can play your experience!

## Continue learning

Particle emitters are an excellent start for creating VFX, but Studio offers many additional VFX features to boost the visuals of your experiences, including:

- [Beams](../../../effects/beams.md) that render a texture between two points that stay still.
- [Trails](../../../effects/trails.md) that render a texture between two points that move.
- [Flipbooks](../../../effects/particle-emitters.md#flipbooks) that animate a texture over time.
- [Light sources](../../../effects/light-sources.md) that emit light at specific points in the 3D space.
