Using the [Mansion of Wonder](https://www.roblox.com/games/6901029464/Mansion-of-Wonder) sample as a guide, this tutorial acts as an introduction to creating special effects (VFX) in Roblox Studio using particle emitters. As you follow each chapter, you will learn how to create a laser blast and explosion that players can use as they defeat sinister slimes and ghastly ghosts in a spooky carnival experience.

This lesson is intended for readers who are **brand new** to creating VFX art and working in Studio. If you are familiar with both, try another beginner lesson plan or jump straight to [building your first experience](../core/index.md).
