Now that your VFX art is complete, it's time to playtest your experience to verify that both particle emitters emit particles properly and with the correct visuals, then publish your work to Roblox so that you can save your progress.

## Playtest your art

It's important to playtest your experience often to ensure that your VFX art looks exactly the way you want it to display to your players. Studio offers several playtest options:

- **Test** – Starts the playtest by inserting your avatar at a spawn location.
- **Test Here** – Starts the playtest by inserting your avatar in front of the camera's current position.
- **Run** – Starts the playtest without inserting your avatar. Instead, the playtest begins at the current camera position and you can navigate around using the camera controls.

While all options are useful at different times, it's important to use a playtest option that inserts your avatar so that you can access the carnival ride and test your laser blast and explosion VFX.

To playtest your art:

1. In the top-left corner of Studio, verify that your playtest is set to either **Test** or **Test Here**, then click the **Play** button. Studio enters playtest mode.

## Publish to Roblox

If you were to close Studio now, you would lose every edit you made to your experience. For this reason, it's important to publish your work to Roblox often to save your work and connect the experience to your account.
