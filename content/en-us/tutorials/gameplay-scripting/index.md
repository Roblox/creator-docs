**Gameplay scripting** is the discipline of programming the behavior that makes experiences
engaging and fun to play, such as their logic, movement, events, and interactions between
objects in the 3D space.

You'll learn the gameplay scripting for a first-person shooter laser tag experience by
following the general organization and key implementation details of a large, complex
project, including several opportunities to create new behavior with custom values.

This course is intended for readers who are familiar with general coding concepts, Studio's
data model, and the client-server relationship. If you need help learning how to code, try [coding fundamentals](../fundamentals/coding-1/coding-fundamentals.md).
