**Environmental art** is the discipline of creating and configuring 3D environments
that embody and facilitate gameplay requirements, immerse users within your experience,
and provide contextual information about the world itself.

You'll learn how to recreate a [high-quality environment](https://www.roblox.com/games/14447845297/Environment-Art-Optimizing)
for a first-person shooter laser tag experience by following step-by-step processes and
best practices for level design, developing assets, and optimization efforts for memory
and performance that you can then implement in your own experiences.

This course is intended for readers who are familiar
with general building concepts and tools in Roblox Studio. If you need help
learning how to build an environment, try the [core curriculum](../../tutorials/core/index.md).
