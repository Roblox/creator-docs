Beams are an effect that can be used to create lasers, force fields, and even waterfalls. This object draws a texture between two points with customizable properties like speed, width, and curve.

## Trap Setup

In this tutorial, you'll create a laser trap that uses a beam and insert a script to set a player's health to 0 when the trap is touched.

### Add Attachments

**Attachments** are where one object can connect to another. In this case, attachments will be used for the start and end points of the beam.

</figure>

1. Attachments aren't normally visible. To view attachments, toggle on **Constraint Details** in the **Model** tab.

   ![alt](../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_constraintDetails.png)

2. Create an anchored part or model named **LaserTrap**. Then, add two attachments named **StartAttachment** and **EndAttachment**.

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_showTrapPart.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_showPartsCreated.png" />
   </GridContainer>

## Move Attachments

New attachments are created in the center of the part. For the beam, the attachments will need to be moved into position.

1. Select **StartAttachment** (1) and use the **Move** tool to position it at the edge of the laser trap.
2. Move **EndAttachment** (2) further away to where the laser should stop.

<Alert severity="info">

Attachments may be hidden inside a part. To display hidden attachments, enable **Draw On Top** from the **Model** tab.

</Alert>

## Create the Beam

With the attachments in place, a beam can now be created.

1. Under **LaserTrap**, add a **Beam** object named **Laser**.

   ![alt](../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_addBeamObject.jpg)

2. With **Laser** selected, find **Attachment0** in the Properties window. Click the empty box to the right of the property and then, in the Explorer, click **StartAttachment**.

   <video controls loop muted>
   <source src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/laserTrap_setAttachment0.mp4" />
   </video>

3. Set **Attachment1** to **EndAttachment** using the same process. The properties should appear as below.

   ![alt](../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_showAttachmentsSet.png)

4. By default, a beam doesn't always face the camera. This may lead to situations where players are unable to see a beam from different angles.

      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_beamDifferentAngles_left.jpg" />

      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_beamDifferentAngles_top.jpg" />
      <b>Top View</b>
    </Grid>
   </Grid>

   So the beam is visible at any position, go into the beam properties and enable `FaceCamera`.

## Beam Properties

Beams use 2D images that can be customized with properties to affect the color, size, or curvature.

1. Copy the **asset ID** of an image you uploaded, or copy an ID from the examples below.

   <Grid container spacing={6}>
    <Grid item xs={4}>
      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/beam6060542021.png" />
      `rbxassetid://6060542021`
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={4}>
      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/beam6060542158.png" />
      `rbxassetid://6060542158`
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={4}>
      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/beam6060542252.png" />
      `rbxassetid://6060542252`
    </Grid>
   </Grid>

2. In the beam's `Texture` property, paste the asset ID.

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_showBeamWithTexture.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_pasteTextureID.png" />
   </GridContainer>

3. Make the laser appear brighter by changing a few properties.

   1. Add a faint glow by changing the `LightEmission` property to 0.5.
   2. Change `Transparency` to 0 (fully opaque).

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_showBeamLightEmission.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_transparencyLightEmission.png" />
   </GridContainer>

4. Make the beam wider by setting both **Width0** and **Width1** to 4.

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_beamWidthLarger.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_setWidth.png" />
   </GridContainer>

5. The `TextureSpeed` property animates the texture over time. For a fast, flickering effect, set it to 3.

6. Make the laser look a bit more dangerous by changing its `Color` property.

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_beamColor.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_changeColor.png" />
   </GridContainer>

<Alert severity="info">

Textures have different modes, the default being **Stretch** which stretches the texture between the two attachments. Depending on your beam, you may want an alternative like **Wrap** or **Static**. Learn more on the `Class.Beam.TextureMode|TextureMode` page.

</Alert>

## Trap Mechanic

The script for the trap will check if an invisible part is touches a player. The part is used since beams don't have collision detection by default.

1. In **LaserTrap**, create a new part named **CollisionBox** that overlaps the beam.

   <GridContainer numColumns="2">
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_collisionBox.jpg" />
     <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_createCollisionBox.png" />
   </GridContainer>

2. **Anchor** CollisionBox so it doesn't move.

   ![alt](../../../assets/tutorials/laser-traps-with-beams/lasertrap_anchorPart.png)

3. In the main model or part named **LaserTrap**, add a new script. Copy the code below and paste it into the new script.

   ```lua
   local laserTrap = script.Parent
   local collisionBox = laserTrap:FindFirstChild("CollisionBox")

   -- Hide the collision box
   collisionBox.Transparency = 1

   local function onTouch(otherPart)
     local character = otherPart.Parent
     local humanoid = character:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Humanoid")

     if humanoid then
       humanoid.Health = 0
     end
   end

   collisionBox.Touched:Connect(onTouch)
   ```

4. Test the trap by walking into the laser beam. If it's not working correctly, make sure the script is in the right place and the collision box is properly named.

With the beam complete, explore additional beam properties like `CurveSize0` and `CurveSize1`, [import](../../../production/publishing/publishing-assets.md) your own textures, or even make a new object like a force field.
