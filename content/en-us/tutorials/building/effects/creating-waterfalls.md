title: Creating Waterfalls with VFX
description: The process of creating waterfalls to elevate your visual and gameplay requirements.
---

A **waterfall** is a point in a river or stream where water flows over one or more vertical drops into a body of water. Experiences often include waterfalls for visual aesthetics, such as to enhance the environment or create a visual point of interest, or for functional gameplay purposes, such as to hide resources or transition players between different areas in the place itself.

Using the [Waterfall Island](https://www.roblox.com/games/16454663889/Use-Case-Tutorials-Volcano-Island) `.rbxl` file as a reference, this tutorial shows you how to create a waterfall with VFX objects that represent real-world physical behavior, including guidance on:

- Breaking down referential material into individual components with distinct visual and behavioral characteristics.
- Configuring cascades that fall at different rates to emulate water dispersing as it descends from a cliff.
- Configuring splashes to emulate water becoming aerosolized as cascades impact the underlying plunge pool.
- Configuring white water to emulate turbulent aerated water where the outflow crashes into boulders.
- Configuring foam to emulate a capillary wave breaking surface tension.
- Configuring mist to emulate mist vapors rising away and upward from the impact point, creating a rainbow players can view from any angle.

## Break Down Reference

To create credible waterfalls, it's important to reference real-world natural features in the design process because it allows you to break down the subject matter into individual components with distinct visual and behavioral characteristics. For example, the sample [Waterfall Island](https://www.roblox.com/games/16454663889/Use-Case-Tutorials-Volcano-Island) experience references Snoqualmie Falls in Washington state to inform all texture and VFX design decisions relating to the waterfall and its surrounding terrain.

While a waterfall is a continuous and connected stream of water that involves multiple states of matter with dynamic fluid and air motion, it's useful to break down this complex system into individual components so that you can plan how to utilize different VFX objects to mimic their real-world counterparts. To demonstrate, this tutorial breaks the sample waterfall down into five unique components:

- **Cascades** – The water that descends off the cliff.
- **Splashes** – The water that scatters as cascades collide with the underlying plunge pool.
- **White Water** – The turbulent water that arises as the water source approaches the edge of the cliff.
- **Foam** – The aerated water that scatters horizontally upon the collision of the cascades and the plunge pool.
- **Mist** – The cloud-like water that evaporates in the air as a result of the overall waterfall.

The following sections provide an in-depth analysis of the different design decisions and techniques you can use to recreate each of these waterfall components that make up the main drop in the sample's 3D space. As you review these decisions and experiment with various `Class.Beam` and `Class.ParticleEmitter` properties, you will learn how to utilize VFX to solve the unique environmental requirements for your own experiences.

## Configure Cascades

A **cascade** is the falling water that descends over the edge of cliffs or bluffs into underlying plunge pools. Cascades fall at different rates depending on both their volume of water and the scale of their drop into the plunge pool. For example, the sample's main drop appears to fall more slowly because there is a large volume of water falling over a large distance, but the sample's second drop appears to fall more quickly because a smaller volume of water is falling over a short distance.

  </figure>
</GridContainer>

Furthermore, waterfalls often have layers of cascades that fall at different rates because the water disperses as it descends into the plunge pool. To demonstrate this principle, the sample uses multiple `Class.Beam` objects with seamless textures that render between `Class.Attachment` objects at varying speeds and lengths. In addition to providing the main drop with a more realistic falling behavior, this technique also creates an illusion of parallax to make the cascade seem like it has a sense of depth and volume even though it's only a 2D image.

To recreate the cascades for the main drop in the sample [Waterfall Island](https://www.roblox.com/games/16454663889/Use-Case-Tutorials-Volcano-Island) place file:

1. Create the outflow for the cascading water.
   1. In the **Explorer** window, create a **Folder** in the **Workspace** to contain all outflow objects, then rename the folder **Outflow**.
   1. Insert two **block** parts into the **Outflow** folder, then rename them **OutflowStart** and **OutflowStop**, respectively.
   1. Move **OutflowStart** to where you want the outflow to begin, and move **OutflowStop** to the edge of the cliff.

      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1C.png" alt="An angled top-down view of the outflow water with two block parts positioned where the outflow texture should render." width="80%" />

   1. Insert an attachment into both **OutflowStart** and **OutflowStop**, then rotate the attachments until the yellow visual aid points upward.

      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1D.png" alt="An angled top-down view of the outflow water with two block parts that include attachements where the yellow visual aids point upward." width="80%" />

   1. Insert a **Beam** into the **Outflow** folder, then rename it **OutflowWater**.
   1. Assign each part's attachment to **OutflowWater**.

      1. In the **Explorer** window, select **OutflowWater**.
      1. In the **Properties** window,
         1. Set **Attachment0** to the attachment in **OutflowStart**.
         1. Set **Attachment1** to the attachment in **OutflowStop**. The beam renders its default texture between the two attachments.

      <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1F.png" alt="An angled top-down view of the outflow water with two block parts rendering the default beam texture between the attachments." width="80%" />

   1. Customize the beam's visual appearance so it looks like flowing water approaching the edge of the cliff.

      1. In the **Explorer** window, verify **OutflowWater** is still selected.
      1. In the **Properties** window,
         1. Set **Texture** to `rbxassetid://4787437624` to render a new texture that looks like flowing foam.
         1. Set **Width0** to `60` to widen the texture from the axis that it starts to render.
         1. Set **Width1** to `20` to funnel the texture to the cliff's edge.
         1. Set **TextureSpeed** to `0.4` to slow down the flow of the texture.
         1. Set **TextureLength** to `64` to stretch the texture's length.
         1. Set **TextureMode** to **Wrap** to repeat the texture to the amount of the beam's overall length in the 3D world between the attachments divided by its **TextureLength**. This allows the texture to look a lot more realistic to flowing water.
         1. Set **Color** to a color sequence that alternates in color from dark and light blues to white.
            1. Click the **Color** property, then click the ⋯ button. A color sequence pop-up displays.

               <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1G1.png" alt="A close up view of Studio's Properties window with the Color property's ellipsis button highlighted." width="60%" />

               Each triangle on the bottom axis of the color sequence is a **keypoint** that determines the color value of the property at that point of the particle's lifetime.

            1. Set the following time and value properties throughout the color sequence:

               - **Time** = `0`, **RGB Value** = `208, 247, 255`
               - **Time** = `0.135`, **RGB Value** = `146, 235, 255`
               - **Time** = `0.248`, **RGB Value** = `255, 255, 255`
               - **Time** = `0.384`, **RGB Value** = `128, 183, 202`
               - **Time** = `0.757`, **RGB Value** = `166, 213, 248`
               - **Time** = `1`, **RGB Value** = `255, 255, 255`

               <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1G2.png" alt="" width="80%" />

         1. Set **Transparency** to a number sequence that makes the water become more vibrant as it approaches the cliff's edge.
            1. Click the **Transparency** property, then click the ⋯ button. A number sequence pop-up displays. By default, the graph is a straight line and the image remains the same transparency from left to right.

               <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1H1.png" alt="A close up view of the Transparency number sequence graph." width="80%" />

               Each square at the start and end of the number sequence is a **keypoint** that determines the transparency value of the property at that point of the texture from left to right.

            1. Set the following time and value properties throughout the number sequence:

               - **Time** = `0`, **Value** = `1`
               - **Time** = `0.375`, **Value** = `0.725`
               - **Time** = `0.615`, **Value** = `0`
               - **Time** = `0.92`, **Value** = `1`
               - **Time** = `1`, **Value** = `1`

               <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/creating-waterfalls/Cascades-1H2.png" alt="" width="80%" />

         1. Scale each part to ensure the texture covers the width of the outflow pool. The outflow now appears to be flowing toward the edge of the cliff from all angles.

## Configure Splashes

When cascades impact the density of the underlying plunge pool, the water propels upward from the impact point to create **splashes**. As this aerosolized water propels upward, it expands and breaks apart from itself to produce droplets that scatter in various directions.

To demonstrate this process, the sample uses two `Class.ParticleEmitter` objects at the base of the main drop. The first particle emitter emits particles that look like dense splashes that represent the weight of the water that begins to propel upward as the cascades impact the plunge pool. The second particle emitter emits particles that look like droplets that represent the water becoming aerosolized.

When you configure these particle emitters to emit both of these particles at the same time but at different rates, the resulting visual effect emulates the real-world physical behavior of splashes. These types of details contribute to the realism of your VFX, and immerse players within the 3D space.

## Configure White Water

**White water** arises as the water source becomes more turbulent as it gains velocity when approaching its descent and colliding with objects in its path. This results in aerated, webby water that appears white due to more air bubbles in the water source.

To mimic this process, the sample uses two `Class.ParticleEmitter` objects that emit particles that look like heavily aerated splashes where the outflow crashes into the boulders at the edge of the cliff. The emitter doesn't use built in lighting, and instead prioritizes white and gray hues with various falling rates to demonstrate the quantity of air in the water.

## Configure Foam

Unlike splashes that propel upward as cascades impact the plunge pool, **foam** is aerated water that ripples outward from the base of the impact point. Similar to splashes, foam expands and breaks apart from itself into web-like droplets as it becomes aerosolized.

To mimic this effect, the sample uses a `Class.ParticleEmitter` object to emit particles that look like foam ripples, and it emits them slowly parallel to the plunge pool. This allows the particle to emulate the visual and behavioral effect of a capillary wave breaking the surface tension of the underlying pool of water.

## Configure Mist

As cascades make impact with the plunge pool, some of the water evaporates and condenses in the cool, humid air to create **mist**. Mist vapors don't catch lighting in the same way that hard surfaces do; instead, they reflect light in often unexpected ways to appear bright within the overall environment until they completely evaporate.

The sample emulates this process by using two `Class.ParticleEmitter` objects at the base of the drop. The first particle emitter energetically emits particles away from the impact point and cliff, and the second emits particles that slowly rise toward the sky. Both particle emitter's particles are bright at the start of their lifetime, and slowly become transparent toward the end of their lifetime as they evaporate.

Similar to the real-world, the mist evaporation process allows a rainbow to form as light reflects off of the small water droplets, which the sample also emulates with a `Class.ParticleEmitter` object that emits rainbow particles with a short lifespan. These particles face the camera no matter the player's angle from the waterfall to produce an optical illusion of light catching on the vapor itself.
