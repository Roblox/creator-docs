Audio in Roblox is created with a `Class.Sound` object. Sounds can be positional, such as the sound of a waterfall, or universal for all players. This tutorial will show you how to create a universal sound to play background music.

## Playing Music

You can [upload](../../../sound/assets.md#importing-custom-audio) music or [obtain it from the marketplace](../../../sound/assets.md#finding-audio-assets), which contains thousands of free-to-use tracks. For this tutorial, you need the **asset ID** of a track.

The basic steps are to copy an asset ID, create a `Class.Sound` object, and use a script to play the music.

### Sound Setup

If a sound object is parented to a part, sound will emit from its position. If a sound object is parented to **SoundService**, it will play at the same volume at every point in the game world. This makes SoundService ideal for storing background music.

1. In **SoundService**, insert a **Sound** object named **BackgroundMusic**.

2. In the newly created sound, find the **SoundId** property. Paste in the previously copied sound ID (or use one below) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

3. Test that the sound works by clicking the Preview button.

Here are some sample music IDs you can use:

- **Creepy Organ/Dungeon** - `rbxassetid://1843463175`
- **Upbeat Electronica** - `rbxassetid://1837849285`
- **Grandiose Fantasy** - `rbxassetid://1848183670`

### Playing the Song

Background music can be played in a game through a script.

1. In **StarterPlayer** > **StarterPlayerScripts**, create a **LocalScript** named **MusicPlayer**.

2. In the script, create variables to store **SoundService** and the **BackgroundMusic** object.

   ```lua
   local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
   local backgroundMusic = SoundService.BackgroundMusic
   ```

3. Sounds are played using the `Class.Sound:Play()|Play` function. In a new line, call it on the `backgroundMusic` variable.

   ```lua
   local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")
   local backgroundMusic = SoundService.BackgroundMusic

   backgroundMusic:Play()
   ```

4. Test the game and confirm that the music is audible.

### Audio Properties

Currently, the music doesn't loop. Additionally, the original sound file may be too loud for background music. These settings can be changed through two properties.

1. In the **BackgroundMusic** properties, toggle **Looped** to be **on**.

2. Lower the **Volume** to around **0.25**.

With this project done, explore using scripts to implement other features in music. For instance, try using a script to shuffle songs in a soundtrack or play songs in different areas of your game world.
