title: Saving Data
description: The process for creating a basic data store to save, store, and read data back.
---

Games often need to store some amount of **persistent data** between sessions like a player's level, experience points, inventory items, gold/cash, and more.

This tutorial will show you how to create a basic **data store**, save sample data, and read the data back into a game session.

## Enabling Studio Access

By default, games tested in Studio cannot access data stores, so you must first enable them.

1. Make sure your game is [published](../../../../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md) to enable Studio access.

2. From the **Home** tab, open the **Game Settings** window.

3. In the **Security** section, turn on **Enable Studio Access to API Services**.

4. Click **Save** to register your changes.

## Creating a Data Store

Data stores are identified by a unique **name**. In this example, a data store named **PlayerGold** will save each player's gold to persistent storage.

1. Create a new `Class.Script` within `Class.ServerScriptService` called **GoldManager**.

   <img src="../../../../assets/tutorials/intro-to-saving-data/ServerScriptService-GoldManager.png" width="320" />

2. Data stores are managed by `Class.DataStoreService`, so get the service on the first line.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
   ```

3. Call `Class.DataStoreService:GetDataStore()` with the string `"PlayerGold"`. This will access the **PlayerGold** data store if it already exists, or create it otherwise.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

   local goldStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerGold")
   ```

## Saving Data

A data store is essentially a dictionary, like a Lua table. Each value in the data store is indexed by a unique **key**, for instance the player's unique `Class.Player.UserId|UserId` or simply a named string for a game promo.

To save player data in the data store:

1. Create a variable named `playerUserID` for the data store key. Then, use `playerGold` to store a player's starting gold amount.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

   local goldStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerGold")

   -- Data store key and value
   local playerUserID = 505306092
   local playerGold = 250
   ```

2. To save data into the `PlayerGold` data store, call `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()|SetAsync` within a protected call, passing the key and value variables previously created.

		```lua
		local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

		local goldStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerGold")

		-- Data store key and value
		local playerUserID = 505306092
		local playerGold = 250

		-- Set data store key
		local setSuccess, errorMessage = pcall(function()
			goldStore:SetAsync(playerUserID, playerGold)
		end)
		if not setSuccess then
			warn(errorMessage)
		end
		```

Functions like `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()|SetAsync()` are network calls that may occasionally fail. As shown above, `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` is used to detect and handle when such failures occur.

In its most basic form, `Global.LuaGlobals.pcall()` accepts a function and returns two values:

- The status (`boolean`); this will be `true` if the function executed without errors, or `false` otherwise.
- The return value of the function or an error message.

In the sample above, the status (`setSuccess`) is tested on line `13` and, if `Class.GlobalDataStore:SetAsync()|SetAsync()` failed for any reason, `errorMessage` is displayed in the [Output](../../../../studio/output.md) window.

<Alert severity="warning">
Be careful to not send requests to data stores too often. Requests on a data store key are placed in a queue and, if the queue fills up, additional requests will be [dropped](../../../../cloud-services/data-stores/index.md#error-codes).

A common mistake may be updating a player's gold data every time they collect a gold piece. Instead, store the player's gold in a variable and only update the data store occasionally, such as with a periodic auto-save and/or when the player leaves the game.
</Alert>

## Reading Data

To read data from a data store, call `Class.GlobalDataStore:GetAsync()|GetAsync()` with the desired key name.

```lua
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

local goldStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerGold")

-- Data store key and value
local playerUserID = 505306092
local playerGold = 250

-- Set data store key
local setSuccess, errorMessage = pcall(function()
	goldStore:SetAsync(playerUserID, playerGold)
end)
if not setSuccess then
	warn(errorMessage)
end

-- Read data store key
local getSuccess, currentGold = pcall(function()
	return goldStore:GetAsync(playerUserID)
end)
if getSuccess then
	print(currentGold)
end
```

To test the script, click **Run** and notice the `currentGold` value printed to the **Output** window. Note that it may take a couple seconds, as the functions must connect to data store servers.

## Sample Project

Now that you understand basic data store usage, test it out in the [Gold Rush](https://www.roblox.com/games/5268331031/Gold-Rush) sample game. You can also edit the game in Studio and explore the enhanced **GoldManager** script which includes data autoâ€‘saving and more.
