title: Add voice chat
description: Explains how to add different forms of voice chat to your experiences.
---

**Voice chat** is a proximity-based chat feature that simulates realistic communication by adjusting the volume of players speaking as they move closer or further from one another in the 3D space. By letting players talk to each other with their microphones, they are able to socialize and strategize together in real time across the globe to complete your experience's objectives.

Using the [Gingerbread Island - Voice Chat](https://www.roblox.com/games/91891961746476/Gingerbread-Island-Voice-Chat) `.rbxl` file as a reference, this tutorial shows you how to incorporate different forms of voice chat into your gameplay, including guidance on:

- Sorting players into teams that can only use voice chat with their teammates.
- Allowing players to temporarily activate their microphone while they're pushing a specific button on their device.
- Configuring time periods where voice chat is either enabled or disabled.

As you review the following sections alongside the sample, you can adjust each code sample to better meet the needs of your own voice chat requirements.

<Alert severity="info">
Voice chat is only available to players who are at least 13 years of age and have verified their account through either a phone number or government issued ID, depending on their country. For a full list of country verification requirements, see [Voice chat](../../../chat/voice-chat.md).
</Alert>

## Configure settings

In order for team chat, push to chat, or time-based chat to work appropriately, you must configure your voice chat setup to enable voice chat and create the appropriate audio objects necessary for picking up and emitting audio within the 3D environment.

To configure your settings for voice chat:

1. Allow players to use their microphones.
   1. In the toolbar's **Home** tab, click **Game Settings**. If the button is disabled, you must first publish your experience to the cloud.
   1. In the lefthand navigation of the **Game Settings** menu, navigate to the **Communication** tab, then toggle **Enable Microphone** so the selector turns from gray to green.
   1. Publish the place to save your changes.
1. Configure **VoiceChatService** so that it creates the necessary audio objects for voice chat.
   1. In the toolbar's **Model** tab, click **Service**.
   1. In the pop-up window, select **VoiceChatService**, then click the **Insert** button. The new service displays in the **Explorer** window along with the default services in every project.
   1. In the **Explorer** window, select **VoiceChatService**, then in the **Properties** window, set **UseAudioApi** to **Enabled**.

When players join your experience, your voice chat setup now:

- Allows voice-eligible players to use their microphones.
- Creates and parents an `Class.AudioDeviceInput` object under each voice-eligible `Class.Player` object.
- Creates and parents an `Class.AudioEmitter` object under each voice-eligible `Class.Player.Character`.
- Creates and parents an `Class.AudioListener` under the `Class.Workspace.CurrentCamera`.

The following sections detail three unique voice chat configurations using these settings. As you follow along with the sample [Gingerbread Island - Voice Chat](https://www.roblox.com/games/91891961746476/Gingerbread-Island-Voice-Chat) place file, you can enable the corresponding disabled script in the **Explorer** window to test their behavior. To ensure that each one works properly, **make sure to disable the script again before moving on to the next configuration**.

## Add team chat

**Team chat** is a voice chat configuration in which only players on the same team can speak or hear one another in an experience. Integrating team chat into your gameplay is useful when you want players to collaborate and strategize together to solve problems in the experiences, such as coordinating information for enemy team positions, resources, and assignments.

To recreate the team voice chat in the sample [Gingerbread Island - Voice Chat](https://www.roblox.com/games/91891961746476/Gingerbread-Island-Voice-Chat) place file:

1. In the **Explorer** window, insert a **Script** into **ServerScriptService**.
1. Rename the script **TeamChat**, then paste the following code into the script:

   ``` lua
   local Teams = game:GetService("Teams")
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local redTeam = Instance.new("Team", Teams)
   redTeam.TeamColor = BrickColor.new("Bright red")
   redTeam.AutoAssignable = true
   redTeam.Name = "Red Team"

   local blueTeam = Instance.new("Team", Teams)
   blueTeam.TeamColor = BrickColor.new("Bright blue")
   blueTeam.AutoAssignable = true
   blueTeam.Name = "Blue Team"

   local function getUserIds(team : Team) : {number}
	   local userIds = {}
	   for _, player : Player in team:GetPlayers() do
		   table.insert(userIds, player.UserId)
	   end
	   return userIds
   end

   local function getDevices(team : Team) : {AudioDeviceInput}
	   local devices = {}
	   for _, player : Player in team:GetPlayers() do
		   local device : AudioDeviceInput = player:FindFirstChild("AudioDeviceInput")
		   if not device then
			   continue
		   end
		   table.insert(devices, device)
	   end
	   return devices
   end

   local function updateTeam(team : Team)
	   local users = getUserIds(team)
	   for _, device in getDevices(team) do
		   device.AccessType = Enum.AccessModifierType.Allow
		   device:SetUserIdAccessList(users)
	   end
   end

   local function onDeviceAdded(device : AudioDeviceInput)
	   local player : Player = device.Parent
	   if player.Team then
		   updateTeam(player.Team)
	   end
   end

   local function onPlayerAdded(player : Player)
	   local device = player:FindFirstChild("AudioDeviceInput")
	   if device then
		   onDeviceAdded(device)
	   end
	   player.ChildAdded:Connect(function(child)
		   if child.Name == "AudioDeviceInput" then
			   onDeviceAdded(child)
		   end
	   end)
   end

   updateTeam(blueTeam)
   updateTeam(redTeam)

   for _, player in Players:GetPlayers() do
	   onPlayerAdded(player)
   end

   Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
   blueTeam.PlayerAdded:Connect(function() updateTeam(blueTeam) end)
   blueTeam.PlayerRemoved:Connect(function() updateTeam(blueTeam) end)
   redTeam.PlayerAdded:Connect(function() updateTeam(redTeam) end)
   redTeam.PlayerRemoved:Connect(function() updateTeam(redTeam) end)
   ```

   </AccordionSummary>
   <AccordionDetails>
      The script starts by getting the `Class.Teams` and `Class.Players` services so that it can use their out-of-the-box functionality to sort players into teams as soon as they join the experience. For example, without any additional scripting effort, the `Class.Teams` service handles actions like:

      - Sorting and balancing players evenly into each team.
      - Grouping players under their team on the leaderboard.
      - Tinting player names in the 3D space to their corresponding team color.

      Using this service, the script creates two distinct `Class.Team` objects with different `Class.Team.Color|Color` properties values to represent each team: **bright red** for one team and **bright blue** for the other.

      The script then defines three functions where the bulk of the work occurs for setting up the team voice chat configuration:

      - `getUserIds` - Returns an array of userIDs for all players in a team.
      - `getDevices` - Returns an array of `Class.AudioDeviceInput` objects for all players in a team. Every Class.`AudioDeviceInput` object represents a player's **physical microphone** in the real world.
      - `updateTeam` - Retrieves all userIDs from `getUserIds`, iterates over the `Class.AudioDeviceInput` objects from `getDevices`, sets their `Enum.AccessModifierType` property to **Allow** so that only the userIDs in each team are permitted to hear from the microphones of their teammates, then updates the `SetUserIdAccessList` with the userIDs from the team.

      The remainder of the script controls how these functions and event listeners work together:

      - When a new player joins the experience, the script verifies if the player has a microphone and updates their team.
      - When the script detects a new `Class.AudioDeviceInput` object, it calls `updateTeam` for their respective red or blue team.
      - As players join or leave the experience, the script connects to the `PlayerAdded` and `PlayerRemoved` events to update each team's settings.

1. Playtest the experience with a couple friends to verify that teammates from each team can only hear each other through voice chat.

## Add push to chat

**Push to chat** is a voice chat configuration in which players are only able to activate their microphone within an experience while they press and hold a specific button on their device. Integrating push to chat into your gameplay is useful when you want players to have more privacy and control when they want to be heard over other players and ambient noise.

To recreate the push to voice chat in the sample [Gingerbread Island - Voice Chat](https://www.roblox.com/games/91891961746476/Gingerbread-Island-Voice-Chat) place file:

1. In the **Explorer** window, insert a **Script** into **ReplicatedStorage**.
1. In the **Properties** window, set **RunContext** to **Client** so that the script only controls the local player's microphone.
1. Rename the script **PushToChat**, then paste the following code into the script:

   ``` lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

   local audioIn: AudioDeviceInput = Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("AudioDeviceInput")
   local pushToTalkKey = Enum.KeyCode.V

   audioIn.Muted = true

   UserInputService.InputBegan:Connect(function(input: InputObject)
       if input.KeyCode == pushToTalkKey then
           audioIn.Muted = false
       end
   end)

   UserInputService.InputEnded:Connect(function(input: InputObject)
       if input.KeyCode == pushToTalkKey then
           audioIn.Muted = true
       end
   end)
   ```

   <BaseAccordion>
   <AccordionSummary>
     <Typography variant="h4">Code explanation</Typography>
   </AccordionSummary>
   <AccordionDetails>
      The script starts by getting:

      - The `Class.Players` service so that it can reference all players within the experience.
      - The `Class.UserInputService` service so that it can check when a player presses buttons on their device.
      - The local player's `Class.AudioDeviceInput` object, or physical microphone on their device.

      The script then:

      - Sets the `V` key to be the button the player needs to press and hold in order to speak into their microphone.
      - Mutes the player's microphone.

      The remainder of the script sets up two event listeners for `InputBegan` and `InputEnded` from `Class.UserInputService`. When they press down the `V` key, the `InputBegan` event unmutes the player's microphone, and when they release the `V` key, the `InputEnded` event mutes their microphone again.
   </AccordionDetails>
   </BaseAccordion>

1. Playtest the experience to verify that players can only hear each other through voice chat when they are pressing the `V` key.

## Add time-based chat

**Time-based chat** is a voice chat configuration in which players are only able to speak and hear one another during a set period of time. Integrating time-based chat into your gameplay is useful when you want players to carefully plan how they communicate with each other during specific game phases, such as during round-based discussions or after cutscenes.

To recreate the time-based voice chat in the sample [Gingerbread Island - Voice Chat](https://www.roblox.com/games/91891961746476/Gingerbread-Island-Voice-Chat) place file:

1. In the **Explorer** window, insert a **Script** into **ServerScriptService**.
1. Rename the script **TimeBasedChat**, then paste the following code into the script:

   ``` lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local muteAll = false

   local function toggleMuteAll()
	   muteAll = not muteAll
	   for _, player in Players:GetPlayers() do
		   local device : AudioDeviceInput = player:FindFirstChild("AudioDeviceInput")
		   if not device then
			   continue
		   end
		   device.Muted = muteAll
	   end
   end

   while true do
	   task.wait(15) -- every 15 seconds
	   toggleMuteAll() -- either allow people to speak, or prevent them from speaking
   end
   ```

   <BaseAccordion>
   <AccordionSummary>
     <Typography variant="h4">Code explanation</Typography>
   </AccordionSummary>
   <AccordionDetails>
      This script starts by getting the `Class.Players` service so it can reference its functionality to manage all players in the experience. It then sets a flag `muteAll` to **false**, which the following `toggleMuteAll` function uses to toggle voice chat on and off.

      Let's review the `toggleMuteAll` function:

      - It starts by looping through all players in the experience using `Class.Players.GetPlayers`.
      - For each player, it checks to see if it has a child `Class.AudioDeviceInput` object, or physical microphone on their device.
      - If they do, the function sets the `Class.AudioDeviceInput` object's `Class.AudioDeviceInput.Muted|Muted` property to the value of `muteAll`. For example, if `muteAll` is **true**, the player's microphone is disabled, and if `muteAll` is **false**, the player's microphone is enabled.

      The script then enters an infinite loop, waiting 15 seconds to mute and unmute all `Class.AudioDeviceInput` objects.

1. Playtest the experience to verify that players can only hear each other through voice chat in 15 second increments.
