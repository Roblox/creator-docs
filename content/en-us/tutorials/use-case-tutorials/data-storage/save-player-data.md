title: Save player data with data stores
description: Create basic data stores to save, store, and load player data.
---

**Data stores** are a service you can use to save and load **persistent player data** across different game sessions. They store important information, like a player's progress or inventory, and allow you to retrieve it for the player next time they join your experience. Without data stores, a player would lose all of their progress every time they left the game.

There are two types of data stores: standard and ordered. This tutorial uses **standard data stores**, which store data like numbers, strings, and tables that don't need to be ranked or sorted.

Using the [Gold Rush data store tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/116344152904993/Gold-Rush-save-data-tutorial-Start) `.rbxl` file as a starting place and the [Gold Rush data store tutorial - Complete](https://www.roblox.com/games/114290473705422/Gold-Rush-save-data-tutorial-Complete) `.rbxl` file as a reference, this tutorial gives you the foundation you need to save player progress and create more consistent experiences, including guidance on:

- Saving and loading the amount of gold a player has collected.
- Updating the UI to display the player's gold inventory.
- Automatically saving the player's gold inventory every 30 seconds.
- Saving the player's position when they leave the experience.
- Restoring the player's position when they join the experience again.

<Alert severity="info">
	The [Gold Rush data store tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/116344152904993/Gold-Rush-save-data-tutorial-Start) starting place file already includes code that allows the player to collect gold and updates the UI with their gold score, but this data doesn't persist across game sessions because the file lacks data stores. Without data stores, the player's score and position reset when they leave the experience.
</Alert>

By the end of this tutorial, you should have two scripts with data stores under `Class.ServerScriptService`:

1. An updated [GoldManager](#goldmanager) script that tracks, loads, and automatically saves the player's gold.
2. An updated [PositionManager](#positionmanager) script that saves the player's position when they leave the experience and restores their position when they come back to the experience.

## Enable Studio access to API services

Data stores aren't stored locally on your device, so your experience relies on server-to-server communication with Roblox's backend in order to use them. By default, Studio restricts this communication to prevent abuse or accidental use. Access to API services in Studio is disabled until you explicitly enable it to make sure that only trusted experiences can read from and write to Roblox's backend servers.

To enable Studio access to API services so that you can use data stores:

1. Open the [Gold Rush data store tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/116344152904993/Gold-Rush-save-data-tutorial-Start) `.rbxl` file in Studio and create a local copy.
2. [Publish your experience](../../../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md#publish-experiences).
3. Back in Studio, go to **File** > **Game Settings** > **Security**.
4. Turn on **Enable Studio Access to API Services**.
5. Save your changes.

## Create a data store

When creating a data store, you should always call the `DataStoreService` from a server-side `Class.Script`. Doing so is important because:

- Roblox blocks all data store access from the client so that only the server has permission to access and modify persistent player data.
- Server-side scripts run in a centralized environment, making sure that the data being read and written to your data store is accurate and valid.
- Since client-side scripts run on the player's device, any player could potentially exploit the experience and steal or overwrite other players' data if the client had access to your data stores.

You should also give your data store a unique name to keep your data organized and to prevent it from overlapping or conflicting in different data stores. In this tutorial, the data store that saves and stores the player's gold inventory is called **PlayerGold**.

To create the PlayerGold data store:

1. Open the existing **GoldManager** script under **ServerScriptService**.

   <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/intro-to-saving-data/ServerScriptService-GoldManager.png" width="320" />

2. Under the other services at the top of the script, initialize the **DataStoreService** and call **`Class.DataStoreService.GetDataStore|GetDataStore`** with the string **"PlayerGold"**.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
   local goldStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerGold")
   ```

## Save and load player data

Data stores are made up of keys, which identify data, and values, which store data.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
		<th width="10%"></th>
    <th width="35%">**Key**</th>
    <th width="40%">**Value**</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
		<th>**Description**</th>
    <td>A key is a unique identifier you can use to access a specific piece of data.<br /><br />Keys let you organize your data so you can easily manage and debug it.</td>
    <td>A value is the actual data you want to save or load, like a player's inventory or their settings.<br /><br />Values let you store progress between sessions, as well as retrieve player data next time they join your experience.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
		<th>**Allowed formats**</th>
    <td>Can only be strings.</td>
    <td>Can be numbers, strings, booleans, or tables.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>**Examples**</th>
    <td>`"Player_A"`, `"TopScore"`, `"ExperienceSetting"`</td>
		<td>`100`, `"Level_5"`, `true`, `{gold = 100, level = 5}`</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In this tutorial, the key is the player's `userId` and the value is the amount of gold they have collected. To use this key and value to save and load player data:

1. In the **GoldManager** script, add a helper function called **saveGold** to save the player's gold to the PlayerGold data store.

   ```lua
   local function saveGold(userId, value)
      local success, err = pcall(function()
         -- `userId` is the unique ID of the player
         -- `value` is the amount of gold to save for that player
         goldStore:SetAsync(userId, value)
      end)
   end
   ```

2. <Chip label="OPTIONAL" size="small" variant="outlined" /> Add a warning to **saveGold** that prints the player's ID and an error message. While not mandatory, this step is good practice for easier debugging in case your function fails.

   ```lua
   local function saveGold(userId, value)
      local success, err = pcall(function()
         -- `userId` is the unique ID of the player
         -- `value` is the amount of gold to save for that player
         goldStore:SetAsync(userId, value)
      end)
      if not success then
         warn("[SAVE ERROR] Could not save gold for", userId, ":", err)
      end
   end
   ```

3. Modify the **onPlayerAdded** event to load the player's gold when they first join the experience. The updated **onPlayerAdded** function:

	- Tries to load the content inside the PlayerGold data store. It returns either the player's saved gold or a value of 0 if the player doesn't have any gold or hasn't played the experience before.
	- Provides you a debug log to help you debug your code more easily. This debug log includes the joining player's saved gold, or an error message if **onPlayerAdded** isn't able to access the data store.
	- Updates the UI to display the player's saved gold on their screen.

   ```lua
   local function onPlayerAdded(player)
      local userId = player.UserId

      local success, storedGold = pcall(function()
         return goldStore:GetAsync(userId)
      end)

      if success then
         local currentGold = storedGold or 0
         playerGold[userId] = currentGold

         uiEvent:FireClient(player, {
            gold = currentGold,
            doTween = false,
            showAlert = not success
         })
      else
         uiEvent:FireClient(player, { showAlert = true })
         warn("Could not load gold for", player.Name)
      end
   end
   ```

4. Modify the **onPlayerRemoving** event to call the **saveGold** function you created earlier and save the player's gold when they leave the experience.

   ```lua
   local function onPlayerRemoving(player)
      local userId = player.UserId

      if playerGold[userId] then
         saveGold(userId, playerGold[userId])
      end
   end
	```

## Automatically save player data

Automatically saving a player's data is good practice because it protects the player from losing their data. If you only save the player's data when they leave the experience with `onPlayerRemoving`, you might lose their latest progress if they unexpectedly disconnect from the server.

<Alert severity="info">
	Make sure not to autosave too often to avoid throttling errors and request limits. A good autosave interval is anywhere between 30 to 120 seconds, depending on how often players gain valuable progress in your experience.
</Alert>

To autosave the player's data:

1. Create a new constant to determine how often you want your experience to automatically save the player's data. A constant is a variable whose value does not change while the game is running. You can use this constant to refer to the autosave interval throughout your script and to easily adjust the autosaving frequency.

   ```lua
	-- This number is in seconds
   local AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 30
   ```

2. Add an autosave coroutine to the existing **onPlayerAdded** function to create a background loop that runs while the player is inside the experience. A coroutine is a function that runs asynchronously; it can pause at certain points, resume where it left off, and run in parallel with other parts of your script without blocking them.

	In this script, the autosave coroutine background loop waits for the number of seconds in your **AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL** constant, then calls the **saveGold** function you created earlier.

   ```lua
   coroutine.wrap(function()
      while player.Parent do
         task.wait(AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL)

         if playerGold[userId] then
            print("[AUTOSAVE] Saving", playerGold[userId], "gold for", player.Name)
            saveGold(userId, playerGold[userId])
         end
      end
   end)()
	```

## Save and load player position

To save a player's position, work with their `Class.Player.Character|Character` instead of the `Class.Player` object itself. A player's `Character` represents their physical model in the game world and has the coordinates for their current position and orientation, while the `Player` object only represents the user account.

Because data stores can only save basic data types like numbers, strings, and tables, you can't directly store complex objects like `Datatype.Vector3` or `Datatype.CFrame` values. To save a player's position, you need to split it into three separate numbers (the X, Y, and Z coordinates) and save them individually. When loading the position later, you can rebuild the `Vector3` using the saved coordinates.

To save and load the character's position:

1. Open the existing **PositionManager** script under **ServerScriptService**.
2. At the top of the script, initialize the **DataStoreService** and call **GetDataStore** with the string **"PlayerPosition"**.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
   local positionStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("PlayerPosition")
   ```

3. Add a helper function called **savePosition** that takes in a player's **userId** and a **Vector3** position. Since you can't save **Vector3** values directly, convert the position to a table of **X, Y, Z** numbers.

   ```lua
   local function savePosition(player, position)
      local userId = player.UserId
      
      local success, err = pcall(function()
         positionStore:SetAsync(userId, {position.X, position.Y, position.Z})
      end)
   end
   ```

4. <Chip label="OPTIONAL" size="small" variant="outlined" /> Add a warning to **savePosition** that prints an error message and the name of the player you failed to save the position for. While not mandatory, this step is good practice for easier debugging in case your function fails.

   ```lua
   local function savePosition(player, position)
      local userId = player.UserId
      
      local success, err = pcall(function()
         positionStore:SetAsync(userId, {position.X, position.Y, position.Z})
      end)

      if not success then
         warn("Could not save position for", player.Name, ":", err)
      end
   end
   ```

5. Add another helper function called **loadPosition** to load the saved coordinates for a player in the PlayerPosition data store. Use **`Class.PVInstance.PivotTo|PivotTo`** to restore the character's position in the world. Since the player's saved position is returned as a table, you have to rebuild a **Vector3** and then convert it to a **CFrame** to move the character.

   ```lua
   local function loadPosition(userId, character)
      local userId = player.UserId

      local success, savedCoords = pcall(function()
         return positionStore:GetAsync(userId)
      end)

      if success and savedCoords then
         local pos = Vector3.new(savedCoords[1], savedCoords[2], savedCoords[3])
         print("Restored position for", player.Name)
         character:PivotTo(CFrame.new(pos))
      elseif not success then
         warn("Could not load position for", player.Name)
      end
   end
	```

6. Modify the **onPlayerAdded** event to set up the position logic for each player that joins your experience. Inside the updated **onPlayerAdded** function:

	- **CharacterAdded** calls **loadPosition** to restore the character's last known location when a player's character spawns.
	- **CharacterRemoving** calls **savePosition** to save the current position of the player's character if they're removed from the experience.
	- **`Class.PVInstance.GetPivot|GetPivot`** gets the character's exact location in the world at the time they're removed.

   ```lua
   local function onPlayerAdded(player)
      local userId = player.UserId

      player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
         loadPosition(player, character)
      end)

      player.CharacterRemoving:Connect(function(character)
         local pos = character:GetPivot().Position
         savePosition(player, pos)
      end)
   end

   Player.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
	```
