title: Create a custom leaderboard with ordered data stores
description: Use ordered data stores to track and rank players by the amount of gold they have collected.
---

**Data stores** are a service you can use to save and load **persistent player data** across different game sessions. They store important information, like a player's progress or inventory, and allow you to retrieve it for the player next time they join your experience. Without data stores, a player would lose all of their progress every time they left the game.

There are two types of data stores: standard and ordered. This tutorial uses **ordered data stores**, which store data that you can rank and sort numerically and retrieve in ascending or descending order based on the stored numerical values.

Using the [Gold Rush create leaderboard tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/123363025813820/Gold-Rush-create-leaderboard-tutorial-Start) `.rbxl` file as a starting place and the [Gold Rush create leaderboard tutorial - Complete](https://www.roblox.com/games/123931337104144/Gold-Rush-create-leaderboard-tutorial-Complete) `.rbxl` file as a reference, this tutorial gives you the foundation you need to create a custom player leaderboard, including guidance on:

- Storing gold scores in an ordered data store.
- Fetching and sorting the top scores globally across all servers.
- Displaying the top scores in a custom leaderboard in the UI.
- Automatically refreshing the custom leaderboard every few seconds.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have the following:

1. Under `Class.ServerScriptService`:
    1. An updated [GoldManager](#goldmanager) script that saves the player's score to an ordered data store for the leaderboard.
    2. A new [LeaderboardRemoteHandler](#leaderboardremotehandler) module script that fetches and returns the sorted list of top scores from the leaderboard.
    3. A new [LeaderboardManager](#leaderboardmanager) script that responds to the leaderboard data requests from the client, acting as a bridge between the client in **LeaderboardGuiScript** and the server in **LeaderboardManager**.
2. Under `Class.StarterGui`, a new [LeaderboardGuiScript](#leaderboardguiscript) local script that renders the leaderboard UI for the player.

## Enable Studio access to API services

Data stores aren't stored locally on your device, so your experience relies on server-to-server communication with Roblox's backend in order to use them. By default, Studio restricts this communication to prevent abuse or accidental use. Access to API services in Studio is disabled until you explicitly enable it to make sure that only trusted experiences can read from and write to Roblox's backend servers.

To enable Studio access to API services so that you can use data stores:

1. Open the [Gold Rush create leaderboard tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/123363025813820/Gold-Rush-create-leaderboard-tutorial-Start) file in Studio. This starting place file already includes the code from the [Save player data](./save-player-data.md) tutorial and the UI skeleton for the player leaderboard.
2. [Publish your experience](../../../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md#publish-experiences).
3. Back in Studio, go to **File** > **Game Settings** > **Security**.
4. Turn on **Enable Studio Access to API Services**.
5. Save your changes.

## Create an ordered data store

When creating a data store, you should always call the `DataStoreService` from a server-side `Class.Script`. Doing so is important because:

- Roblox blocks all data store access from the client so that only the server has permission to access and modify persistent player data.
- Server-side scripts run in a centralized environment, making sure that the data being read and written to your data store is accurate and valid.
- Since client-side scripts run on the player's device, any player could potentially exploit the experience and steal or overwrite other players' data if the client had access to your data stores.

You should also give your data store a unique name to keep your data organized and to prevent it from overlapping or conflicting in different data stores. In this tutorial, the data store for the leaderboard is called **GlobalLeaderboard**.

To create the **GlobalLeaderboard** ordered data store:

1. Open the existing **GoldManager** script under **ServerScriptService**.

   <img src="../../../assets/tutorials/intro-to-saving-data/ServerScriptService-GoldManager.png" width="320" />

2. Under the existing **PlayerGold** data store, call `Class.DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore|GetOrderedDataStore` with the string **"GlobalLeaderboard"**. This creates an ordered data store to save the player's score when they earn gold.

   ```lua
   local leaderboardStore = DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore("GlobalLeaderboard")
   ```

After creating a data store, you're able to reference this same data store across different scripts. For example, you can call `Class.DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore|GetOrderedDataStore` in both the **GoldManager** script and the **LeaderboardManager** module script that you will create later in this tutorial. Referencing the same data store in two places doesn't mean you're duplicating data; it just means that two scripts are accessing the same centralized storage, like two teammates using one folder to share information.

## Send player data to the leaderboard

Data stores are made up of keys, which identify data, and values, which store data. Unlike standard data stores, ordered data stores let you sort data by **value**, which makes them ideal for creating things like leaderboards.

Each entry in an ordered data store is stored under a unique key that you can rank and sort numerically, and then retrieve in ascending or descending order based on the stored numerical values. This means that you can use ordered data stores to, for example, show a top 3 list that updates in real-time as players in your experience collect more gold.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
		<th width="10%"></th>
    <th width="35%">**Key**</th>
    <th width="40%">**Value**</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
		<th>**Description**</th>
    <td>A key is a unique string identifier you can use to access a specific piece of data, like a player's user ID.<br /><br />Keys let you organize your data so you can easily manage and debug it.</td>
    <td>A value is the actual numeric data you want to save or load, like a player's score.<br /><br />Values let you store progress between sessions, as well as retrieve player data next time they join your experience.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
		<th>**Allowed formats**</th>
    <td>Can only be strings. If you're using numbers, like a user ID, convert them to a string using `tostring()`.</td>
    <td>Can only be numbers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>**Examples**</th>
    <td>`"Player_A"`, `"TopScore"`, `"123456"` (userIs as string)</td>
		<td>`100`, `3.14`, `0`, `-25`</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Now that you have created your **GlobalLeaderboard** ordered data store, update the existing `saveGold` function in the **GoldManager** script to send the player's gold score to your custom leaderboard with `Class.GlobalDataStore.SetAsync|SetAsync`:

   ```lua
   local function saveGold(player, value)
     local userId = player.UserId
    
     local success, err = pcall(function()
       goldStore:SetAsync(userId, value)
      
       leaderboardStore:SetAsync(tostring(userId), value)
     end)
     if not success then
       warn("Could not save gold for", player.Name, ":", err)
     end
   end
   ```

You can think of the ordered data store **GlobalLeaderboard** like a shared folder: `SetAsync` adds content to the folder, while `GetSortedAsync` (which you'll create later in the **LeaderboardManager** module script) reads the folder's content and sorts it by score.

## Fetch the leaderboard scores

To fetch the leaderboard scores, you should use a `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScript`. Module scripts let you organize and reuse your code across multiple scripts. Instead of copying the same logic into different places, you can write it once in a module script and call it from anywhere that needs it.

When you store your leaderboard logic in a module, both the UI handler and the server scripts can use the same function to fetch the top player scores. If you ever need to, for example, update how usernames are fetched or how scores are sorted, you only have to change the code in one place. After you update the module, all scripts that use it also automatically get the udpated behavior.

You custom leaderboard uses the following ordered data store methods to share data across different servers:

- `SetAsync` (from the **GoldManager** script) to send player scores to the **GlobalLeaderboard** ordered data store.
- `Class.OrderedDataStore.GetSortedAsync|GetSortedAsync` (in the module script) to fetch the top scores from all servers from the same data store. The `GetSortedAsync` method is exclusive to ordered data stores and can retrieve multiple sorted keys based on a specific sorting order, page size, and minimum and maximum values.

<Alert severity="info">
	As long as each server updates the **GlobalLeaderboard** ordered data store when a player collects gold, and each client retrieves this data from the server, everyone inside your experience will see the same leaderboard with the same top scores.
</Alert>

To fetch the leaderboard scores:

1. Under **ServerScriptService**, create a new `Class.ModuleScript` called **LeaderboardManager**.
2. At the top of the module script, call `Class.DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore|GetOrderedDataStore` with the string **"GlobalLeaderboard"**. Referencing the same ordered data store that you created in the **GoldManager** script will allow the leaderboard UI to fetch and sort the top player scores later.

   ```lua
   local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local leaderboardStore = DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore("GlobalLeaderboard")
   ```

3. Prepare a module table to hold all functions and data you want to expose to other scripts.

   ```lua
   local leaderboardManager = {}
   ```

4. Create a function called **GetTopScores** to get the top player scores. This function:

    - Calls `GetSortedAsync` to fetch the `limit` number of top scores in descending order. If the call fails, an empty list is returned to prevent the rest of your code from crashing.
    - Loops through the leaderboard to get a table of entries with `Class.Pages.GetCurrentPage|GetCurrentPage` and player usernames with `Class.Players.GetNameFromUserIdAsync|GetNameFromUserIdAsync`.
    - Adds each result to a final list and builds a leaderboard table with player usernames and their scores.
    - Returns the final list of players and sends the leaderboard data back to any script that calls this `leaderboardManager.GetTopScores` function.

   ```lua
    function leaderboardManager.GetTopScores(limit)
      local success, pages = pcall(function()
        return leaderboardStore:GetSortedAsync(false, limit)
      end)

      if not success or not pages then
        return {}
      end

      local results = {}

      for _, entry in ipairs(pages:GetCurrentPage()) do
        local userId = tonumber(entry.key)
        local score = entry.value
        local username = "Unknown"

        local ok, name = pcall(function()
          return Players:GetNameFromUserIdAsync(userId)
        end)

        if ok then
          username = name
        end

        table.insert(results, {
          Username = username,
          Score = score
        })
      end

      return results
    end
   ```

5. Make the module usable by returning the module table you created earlier. Whenever you create a module script, you must return the module table so that other scripts can access it and call the functions inside it.

   ```lua
   return leaderboardManager
   ```

## Request leaderboard data from the server

In order for the client UI to display the leaderboard scores, the server has to respond when the client asks for data. A `Class.RemoteFunction` allows the client to request information from the server and wait for a reply.

To request leaderboard data from the server:

1. Under **ReplicatedStorage**, insert a **RemoteFunction** called **LeaderboardRemote**. This remote function acts as the bridge between the UI script on the client and the leaderboard logic on the server.
2. Under **ServerScriptService**, create a script called **LeaderboardRemoteHandler**. In this script:
    1. Call `Class.ReplicatedStorage|ReplicatedStorage` (the shared space between client and server), `Class.ServerScriptService|ServerScriptService` (which holds the leaderboard module), and `leaderboardRemote` (the remote function that the client will call to ask for the leaderboard data).

      ```lua
      local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
      local ServerScriptService = game:GetService("ServerScriptService")

      local leaderboardRemote = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("LeaderboardRemote")
      ```

    2. Load the **LeaderboardManager** module that you created earlier, which includes the function that gets the top scores from the ordered data store.

      ```lua
      local leaderboardManager = require(ServerScriptService:WaitForChild("LeaderboardManager"))
      ```

    3. Set the behavior for when the client calls `Class.RemoteFunction.InvokeServer|InvokeServer`. The server responds by fetching the top 3 scores and sending the result back to the client.

      ```lua
      leaderboardRemote.OnServerInvoke = function(player)
        return leaderboardManager.GetTopScores(3)
      end
      ```

## Display data in the custom leaderboard UI

<Alert severity="info">
	Because of backend caching, the scores in your custom leaderboard can take a few extra seconds to update. To get instant, real-time updates across servers, you can use [memory stores](../../../cloud-services/memory-stores/index.md).
</Alert>

After setting up the server-side scripts, create a local script to fetch the top 3 players every 3 seconds and display the results in a global UI leaderboard inside the experience. 

To display data in your custom leaderboard:

1. Under **StarterGui** > **LeaderboardGui**, create a local script called **LeaderboardGuiScript**.
2. At the top of the script, connect to the remote function. Call `Class.ReplicatedStorage|ReplicatedStorage` to get access to shared objects between the server and client, then call `leaderboardRemote` to allow the client to request the leaderboard data from the server.

    ```lua
    local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
    local leaderboardRemote = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("LeaderboardRemote")
    ```

3. Reference the existing leaderboard UI elements under **LeaderboardGui**.

    ```lua
    local gui = script.Parent
    local leaderboardFrame = gui:WaitForChild("LeaderboardFrame")
    local entriesFrame = leaderboardFrame:WaitForChild("EntriesFrame")
    local template = entriesFrame:WaitForChild("LeaderboardEntry")
    ```

4. Create a function called **clearEntries** to clear old leaderboard entries. This function loops through all children of `entriesFrame`, which contains the leaderboard rows, and makes sure the leaderboard is fully refreshed before displaying new data.

    ```lua
    local function clearEntries()
      for _, child in ipairs(entriesFrame:GetChildren()) do
        if child:IsA("TextLabel") and child.Name:match("^Row%d+$") then
          child:Destroy()
        end
      end
    end
    ```

5. Create a function called **renderLeaderboard** to insert and display player data in the leaderboard rows. The `data` object is a table returned by the server that contains entries with the player usernames and scores.

    ```lua
    local function renderLeaderboard(data)
      clearEntries()

      for i, entry in ipairs(data) do
        local row = template:Clone()
        row.Name = "Row" .. i
        row.Visible = true
        row.LayoutOrder = i

        row.Text = string.format("%d%s place: %s - %d",
          i, i == 1 and "st" or i == 2 and "nd" or i == 3 and "rd" or "th",
          entry.Username, entry.Score)

        row.Parent = entriesFrame
      end
    end
    ```

6. Create a loop to periodically fetch the leaderboard data. Every 3 seconds, the loop runs and calls the server using the `Class.RemoteFunction.InvokeServer|InvokeServer` function you created earlier in the **LeaderboardRemoteHandler** script. If the call is successful, the UI refreshes with the updated scores.

    ```lua
    while true do
      local success, data = pcall(function()
        return leaderboardRemote:InvokeServer()
      end)

      if success and data then
        renderLeaderboard(data)
      end

      task.wait(3)
    end
    ```

## Final code

See the following code snippets for the complete **GoldManager**, **LeaderboardManager**, **LeaderboardRemoteHandler**, and **LeaderboardGuiScript** scripts. You can paste and run them directly in the [Gold Rush create leaderboard tutorial - Start](https://www.roblox.com/games/123363025813820/Gold-Rush-create-leaderboard-tutorial-Start) `.rbxl` file in Studio.

### GoldManager

The **GoldManager** script creates an ordered data store to manage leaderboard updates.

```lua
-- Get services
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local CollectionService = game:GetService("CollectionService")
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

local random = Random.new()

-- Table to store the player's gold chunks for a single game session
local playerGold = {}

-- Constants
local GOLD_VALUE = 10                  -- How much each gold chunk is worth
local GOLD_REGENERATION_BOUNDS = {     -- Area bounds used to reposition gold chunks randomly
  minX = -72,
  maxX = 72,
  minZ = -72,
  maxZ = 72
}
local GOLD_REGEN_DELAY = 2             -- The delay before a chunk respawns (in seconds)
local AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 30           -- How often the player's chunks are saved (in seconds)

-- Function to handle the player collecting a gold chunk
local function processGoldTouch(chunk, player)

  -- Hide the chunk when the player collects it
  chunk.Parent = nil

  -- Add the chunk to the player's session gold score
  local userId = player.UserId

  task.delay(GOLD_REGEN_DELAY, function()

    -- Respawn the gold chunk at a new random position
    local nextPositionX = random:NextInteger(GOLD_REGENERATION_BOUNDS.minX, GOLD_REGENERATION_BOUNDS.maxX)
    local nextPositionZ = random:NextInteger(GOLD_REGENERATION_BOUNDS.minZ, GOLD_REGENERATION_BOUNDS.maxZ)
    chunk.CFrame = CFrame.new(nextPositionX, 50, nextPositionZ) -- Move chunk to new position
    chunk:SetAttribute("DropCollided", false)  -- Reset any collision flags
    chunk.Parent = workspace.GoldChunks
  end)
end

    end
  end)
end

  local success, err = pcall(function()
    goldStore:SetAsync(userId, value)
    leaderboardStore:SetAsync(tostring(userId), value)
  end)
  if not success then

  else

    -- Notify the player their gold couldn't be loaded
    uiEvent:FireClient(player, { showAlert = true })
    warn("Could not load gold for", player.Name)
  end

  -- Start the autosave coroutine to save the player's gold every 30 seconds
  coroutine.wrap(function()
    while player.Parent do
      task.wait(AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL)
      if playerGold[userId] then
        saveGold(player, playerGold[userId])
        print("Autosaving", playerGold[userId], "gold for", player.Name)

    end
  end)()
end

-- Function to handle the player leaving the game
local function onPlayerRemoving(player)
  local userId = player.UserId

  -- Check if the player's gold was tracked
  if playerGold[userId] then

    -- Save the player's gold to the data store before they leave
    saveGold(player, playerGold[userId])
  end
end

-- Connect the joining and leaving player events
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerAdded)
Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(onPlayerRemoving)
```

### LeaderboardManager

The **LeaderboardManager** module script:

- Calls `GetSortedAsync()` on the GlobalLeaderboard ordered data store.
- Converts userIds into usernames using `Class.Players.GetNameFromUserIdAsync|GetNameFromUserIdAsync`.
- Returns a list of `{ Username, Score }` tables for the top-ranked players.
- Is called by LeaderboardRemoteHandler whenever a client requests leaderboard data.

```lua
-- Get services
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")

-- Ordered data store to save leaderboard scores
local leaderboardStore = DataStoreService:GetOrderedDataStore("GlobalLeaderboard")

-- Table to store the leaderboard scores
local leaderboardManager = {}

-- Function to return the top scores
function leaderboardManager.GetTopScores(limit)
	-- Try to retrieve a sorted page of leaderboard entries from the data store
	local success, pages = pcall(function()
		-- false = descending (highest scores first)
		return leaderboardStore:GetSortedAsync(false, limit)
	end)

	-- If the call fails or returns nothing, log a warning and return an empty table
	if not success or not pages then
		warn("Failed to get leaderboard data")
		return {}
	end

	-- Create a table to store top player data
	local topPlayers = {}

	-- Loop through each entry on the current page of leaderboard results
	for _, entry in ipairs(pages:GetCurrentPage()) do
		local userId = tonumber(entry.key)   -- Convert the entry key to a number (userId was stored as a string)
		local score = entry.value            -- The value is the player's score (amount of gold)
		local username = "Unknown"           -- A default name in case lookup fails

		-- Try to get the player's username from their userId
		local ok, name = pcall(function()
			return Players:GetNameFromUserIdAsync(userId)
		end)

		-- If lookup succeeds, store the real username
		if ok then
			username = name
		end

		-- Add this player and their score to the list
		table.insert(topPlayers, {
			Username = username,
			Score = score
		})
	end

	-- Return the full list of top players with their usernames and scores
	return topPlayers
end

-- Return the LeaderboardManager module so other scripts can use it
return leaderboardManager
```

### LeaderboardRemoteHandler

The **LeaderboardRemoteHandler** script fetches and returns the top 3 scores to the calling client.

```lua
-- Get services
local ServerScriptService = game:GetService("ServerScriptService")  -- Access server-side modules
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")      -- Shared client-server communication objects

-- Wait for the RemoteFunction that the client uses to request leaderboard data
local leaderboardRemote = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("LeaderboardRemote")

-- Load the LeaderboardManager module that contains the GetTopScores function
local leaderboardManager = require(ServerScriptService:WaitForChild("LeaderboardManager"))

-- Set up a handler for when the client invokes the leaderboard RemoteFunction
leaderboardRemote.OnServerInvoke = function(player)
	-- Call the leaderboard module to get the top 3 scores and return them to the client
	return leaderboardManager.GetTopScores(3)
end
```

### LeaderboardGuiScript

The **LeaderboardGuiScript** local script:

- Requests leaderboard data from the server every 3 seconds using `Class.RemoteHandler.InvokeServer|InvokeServer`.
- Uses a hidden LeaderboardEntry template to display each leaderboard row.
- Formats each row as "1st place: Username - Score".
- Manages the creation, display, and layout of leaderboard rows using `Class.UIListLayout`.

```lua
-- Get shared storage for RemoteFunction access
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

-- Get the RemoteFunction used to request leaderboard data from the server
local leaderboardRemote = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("LeaderboardRemote")

-- UI references
local gui = script.Parent                                           -- The LocalScript under the ScreenGui
local leaderboardFrame = gui:WaitForChild("LeaderboardFrame")       -- Main container for the leaderboard
local entriesFrame = leaderboardFrame:WaitForChild("EntriesFrame")  -- Frame where leaderboard entries appear
local template = entriesFrame:WaitForChild("LeaderboardEntry")      -- Hidden template TextLabel used to create rows

-- Function to remove old leaderboard rows (but not the template)
local function clearEntries()
	for _, child in ipairs(entriesFrame:GetChildren()) do
		-- Only destroy labels named "Row1", "Row2", etc (leave the template untouched)
		if child:IsA("TextLabel") and child.Name:match("^Row%d+$") then
			child:Destroy()
		end
	end
end

-- Function to display leaderboard data on screen
local function renderLeaderboard(data)
	-- Remove old rows first
	clearEntries()

	for i, entry in ipairs(data) do
		local row = template:Clone()           -- Clone the hidden template
		row.Name = "Row" .. i                  -- Give it a unique name
		row.Visible = true                     -- Make it visible
		row.LayoutOrder = i                    -- Let UIListLayout order it properly

		-- Leaderboard format: "1st place: Username - 123"
		row.Text = string.format("%d%s place: %s - %d",
			i,
			i == 1 and "st" or i == 2 and "nd" or i == 3 and "rd" or "th",
			entry.Username,
			entry.Score
		)

		-- Add the data to the UI
		row.Parent = entriesFrame
	end
end

-- Main loop: update the leaderboard every 3 seconds
while true do
	-- Ask the server for leaderboard data
	local success, data = pcall(function()
		return leaderboardRemote:InvokeServer()
	end)

	if success and data then
		-- Show results on leaderboard
		renderLeaderboard(data)
	else
		warn("Failed to fetch leaderboard data")
	end

	-- Wait 3 seconds before updating again
	task.wait(3)
end
```
