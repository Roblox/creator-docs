title: Moderation
description: Provides information on the moderation policy and process for Marketplace items.
---

When uploading an asset to the Marketplace, the Moderation team reviews the item before you can sell the item. This process can take up to 24 hours. After approval, Roblox sets your item as "Ready To Sell" in the Creator Dashboard or within Studio.

To ensure that your asset has the best chance of successfully clearing moderation, make sure your asset adheres to the [Marketplace Policy](../marketplace/marketplace-policy.md) and that the metadata, such as the title and description, follow [general best practices](../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md#metadata-best-practices).

Moderations can happen after the item passes initial moderation. If Roblox removes an item with sales, Roblox refunds anyone who purchased the item and cancels any pending payments for that item.

If you believe your asset has been incorrectly moderated, you can [file an appeal](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000245263-Appeal-Your-Content-or-Account-Moderation) with our moderation staff.

<Alert severity = 'info'>
If you believe an asset is infringing on your IP, or that one of your assets has been incorrectly removed due to IP, submit a [DMCA request](../production/publishing/dmca-guidelines.md).

## Archive assets

Archiving an asset allows you to remove an asset from the Roblox Marketplace platform. This process can be used to archive both 2D and 3D avatar items. Avatar items may only be archived if they were published at least 180 days prior. At this time, archiving Limited items is not supported.

If you archive an avatar item:

- Your item will no longer be discoverable in Marketplace, and additional users will not be able to acquire it.
- Existing owners of your item will continue owning the item in the inventory and can equip it on their avatar.
- The underlying development assets for the avatar item will continue to exist, and you can still insert the archived avatar item into Studio if the assetID is known.
- An archived item may still be the subject of an IP takedown report, but your decision to archive the item will be considered when applying any account penalties related to the IP report.

To archive items:

1. Navigate to **Creator Dashboard** > **Creations**.
2. On the asset you intend to archive, click the three dots on the thumbnail.
3. Select **Archive in Marketplace**

This process is not a substitute for being vigilant about not infringing on the IP rights of others when creating and uploading content.
