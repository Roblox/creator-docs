title: Moderation
description: Provides information on the moderation policy and process for Marketplace items.
---

When uploading an asset to the Marketplace, the Moderation team reviews the item before you can sell the item. This process can take up to 24 hours. After approval, Roblox sets your item as "Ready To Sell" in the Creator Dashboard or within Studio.

To ensure that your asset has the best chance of successfully clearing moderation, make sure your asset adheres to the [Marketplace Policy](../marketplace/marketplace-policy.md) and that the metadata, such as the title and description, follow [general best practices](../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md#metadata-best-practices).

Moderations can happen after the item passes initial moderation. If Roblox removes an item with sales, Roblox refunds anyone who purchased the item and cancels any pending payments for that item.

If you believe your asset has been incorrectly moderated, you can [file an appeal](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000272703) with our moderation staff.

<Alert severity = 'info'>
If you believe an asset is infringing on your IP, or that one of your assets has been incorrectly removed due to IP, submit a [DMCA request](../production/publishing/dmca-guidelines.md).

## Archiving Assets

Archiving an asset allows you to remove an asset from the Roblox platform. This process can be used to archive both 2D and 3D avatar items. At this time, archiving Limited items and Bundles are not supported.

You can request a one-time permanent archival of your own items by filling out the support form [here](https://www.roblox.com/support) and selecting "Asset Archive Request" under the DMCA category. This process supports both trademark and copyright requests.

Please include the following information to permanently archive it:

- An explicit request to archive your content.
- URL links or assets IDs of the content you wish to archive.

<Alert severity ='warning'>
This process is not a substitute for being vigilant about not infringing on the IP rights of others when creating and uploading content.
