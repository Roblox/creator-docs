The **UGC Homestore** is a user-friendly template that avatar item creators can use to showcase and sell their marketplace items. This template is ideal for creators with an existing UGC catalog who want a dedicated space to promote their assets. Creators who sell their own avatar items from their own experience also benefit from a [larger commission split](../marketplace/marketplace-fees-and-commissions.md#commissions).

The homestore template provides the following features that you can quickly customize with minimal scripting:

- **Mannequins** — 3D displays that can showcase avatar items. Users can interact with mannequins and purchase the showcased items.
- **Integrated shop** — Conveniently located shop button at the bottom of the screen opens a catalog where users can view and purchase items.
- **Modular Building Parts** — Customizable building components for creating a unique and personalized shopfront.

You can find the UGC Homestore Template in Roblox Studio's start screen. To access Studio's provided templates at any time, select **File** > **Open from Roblox** and select **Templates**.

## Customizing Homestore

You can modify the features of the homestore to showcase and sell your assets as well as add your own distinct theme and design. If the place is unpublished, the homestore showcases Roblox-created assets on the mannequins and shop as reference.

### Mannequins

Each mannequin includes custom attributes that allow you to add avatar items, display different poses, use different skin tones, and more.

</figure>
</GridContainer> <br/>

To customize a mannequin:

1. Select an existing mannequin object.
2. In **Properties Panel** > **Attributes**, modify the following fields:
   1. `accessoryIds` — Comma separated list of accessory IDs that display on mannequin.
   2. `bundleIds` — Comma separated list of bundle IDs that display on the mannequin.
      1. To add shoes, you must set them as a bundle to include the right and left shoe.
   3. `poseAnimation` — Animation ID for the mannequin, can be still or looped.
   4. `skinColor` — Sets color tone for the surface skin of the mannequin.

If scripting mannequin behavior, each mannequin includes the <code>Mannequin</code> tag for easy referencing.

### Shop

The template includes a shop button at the bottom of the screen visible for all users. When selected, a catalog interface opens displaying all available catalog items from the creator.

By default, the catalog applies the following behavior:

- If the place is unpublished, such as during initial playtesting, the catalog displays Roblox's marketplace items as reference.
- If the place is published, the catalog automatically displays the current experience owner's available marketplace items.
  - If the current experience owner doesn't have any available marketplace items, the catalog doesn't display any items.
  - You can [set a different creator's catalog](#specifying-another-creators-catalog) as the default by modifying `ReplicatedStorage.Settings`.

#### Specifying Another Creator's Catalog

To set the catalog to use another creator's marketplace items:

1.  In **File** > **Game Settings** > **Security**, enable **Allow Third Party Sales**.

    <img src="../assets/publishing/marketplace/Enable-Third-Party-Sales.png" alt="Section of the Explorer window highlighting the Settings file in Replicated Storage." width = "70%"/>

2.  Ensure that the marketplace items have their sale location set to `Marketplace and All Experiences` or have specified this specific experience as a valid [sale location](../marketplace/publishing-to-marketplace.md#sale-location).

    1.  If the experience is added as a unique sale location, the experience owner [must enable the specific asset for sale using the Creator Dashboard](../production/monetization/avatar-items.md#adding-items-to-experience).

        <Alert severity = 'warning'>
        Failure to properly link and enable a third-party asset means that users can only see the added items, but can't purchase them.
        </Alert>

3.  In **ReplicatedStorage**, open the **Settings** ModuleScript object.

    <img src="../assets/publishing/marketplace/ReplicatedStorage-Settings.png" alt="Section of the Explorer window highlighting the Settings file in Replicated Storage."/>

4.  Modify **DEFAULT_CREATOR_NAME** to the name of the creator.
    1.  If empty, the shop displays the entire Marketplace catalog from all creators.
5.  Set **FETCH_CREATOR_NAME** to `false`. This sets the catalog to always reference the **DEFAULT_CREATOR_NAME** instead of the experience owner.

### Building

Each building component is designed to be modular and extendible. You can quickly duplicate pieces, rotate, and rearrange them to create larger and more intricate structures. For more information on working with modular environments, see [Assembling Modular Environments](../tutorials/use-case-tutorials/modeling/assembling-modular-environments.md).

### Advanced Customizations

For an advanced technical breakdown of the template project, including descriptions of various scripts, components, and behaviors, navigate to `ServerScriptService` and open the `README` ModuleScript. This content is intended for creators who intend to modify the underlying scripts and behaviors of the template project.
