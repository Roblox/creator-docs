## Existing attributes

The default Roblox matchmaking configuration uses signals based on existing attributes like player location, age group, and latency.

To use data for matchmaking that Roblox doesn't automatically include in its default configuration, you need to create [custom attributes](#custom-attributes) and [custom signals](#custom-signals).

    <td>The ratio of players in the server with voice chat enabled.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Age

A numerical signal that compares the average ages of players on a server to the joining player's age. This signal has a max relevant difference of 25. The signal score is inversely related to the age difference, meaning lower age differences have higher scores.

```lua
ageDifferenceSignalScore = 1 - min(25, ageDifference) / 25, where
ageDifference = abs(avgServerAge - joiningPlayerAge)
```

### Device Type

A categorical signal that measures the ratio of players on the server with the same device type as the joining player. Device types include: Computer, mobile device, tablet, console, and VR device.

```lua
deviceTypeSignalScore = (# players with same device as joining player) / (# players on the server)
```

### Friends

A preferred player is a player who is either friends with the joining player or who shares the same IP address as the joining player. The Friends signal is a categorical signal with a score of 1 when there is a preferred player in the server and a score of 0 when there are no preferred players on the server.

```lua
friendsSignalScore = hasFriends ? 1 : 0
```

The Friends signal can also be considered a numerical signal with a maximum relevant value of 1.

```lua
friendsSignalScore = min(# preferred players in server, 1) / 1
```

### Language

A categorical signal that measures the ratio of players on the server who share the same language setting as the joining player.

```lua
languageSignalScore = (# players with same language setting as joining player) / (# players on the server)
```

### Latency

A numerical signal that measures the estimated ping time in milliseconds of the joining player if they were to play on a server. This signal has a max relevant value of 250 milliseconds. The signal score is inversely related to the ping, meaning lower ping values have higher scores.

```lua
latencySignalScore = 1 - min(250, estimatedPingMs) / 250
```

### Occupancy

A numerical signal that measures the ratio of players on the server to the capacity of the server.

```lua
occupancySignalScore = (# players in server) / serverCapacity
```

### Play History

The Play History attribute value is the log-10 number of minutes a player has played in a universe in the past 28 days. This numerical signal compares the average log-10 Play History value of players in the server to the joining player's Play History value. This signal has a max relevant difference of 4.6. The signal score is inversely related to the play history difference, meaning lower play history differences have higher scores.

```lua
playHistorySignalScore = 1 - min(4.6, playHistoryDifference / 4.6), where
playHistoryDifference = abs(avgServerPlayHistory - joiningPlayerPlayHistory)
```

### Voice Chat

A player can have voice chat enabled or disabled. The Voice Chat signal is a categorical signal that measures the ratio of players with the same voice chat setting as the joining player to the number of players in the server.

If a place has voice chat disabled, the Voice Chat signal's weight is 0.

```lua
voiceChatSignalScore = (# players with same voice chat setting as joining player) / (# players on the server)
```

## Custom attributes

Custom attributes give custom signals access to player and server data. For more information about creating your own custom attributes, see [Create a custom attribute](./customize-matchmaking.md#create-a-custom-attribute). For more information about existing Roblox attributes, see [Existing attributes](#existing-attributes).

local currentLevel, error = MatchmakingService:GetServerAttribute("Level")

if error then
  print(error)
else
  print("Current level: " .. currentLevel)
end

local success, error = MatchmakingService:SetServerAttribute("Level", "Advanced")
if not success then
  print("Failed to update server attribute [Level] to [Advanced] due to error: " .. error)
else
  print("Successfully set [Level] to [Advanced]")
end
```

## Custom signals

Custom signals are created and defined by you and can be numerical or categorical:

- Numerical signals are numbers. They compare the difference between the joining player's attribute and the server's aggregated value, with larger differences lowering or increasing the score. For example, the closer the skill level of a player is to the average skill level of the server, the higher the numerical signal's score is. This score is then multiplied by the signal's weight.
- Categorical signals are strings or booleans. They're based on how common the joining player's attribute is when compared to the other players in the server. For example, if a high percentage of the players inside a server have the same preferred language as the joining player, the score increases. This score is then also multiplied by the signal's weight.

For more information about creating your own custom signals, see [Create a custom signal](./customize-matchmaking.md#create-a-custom-signal). For more information about existing Roblox signals, see [Existing signals](#existing-signals).

### Player numerical

<h5>Joining player</h5>

Minimizes the difference between the server's average player attribute and the joining player's attribute. Differences beyond 1000 return a signal score of 0.

```lua title="Joining player formula for player numerical signal"
local diff = math.abs(server_{aggregation_function}_{attribute_name} - joining_player_{attribute_name})
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
return score
```

```lua title="Joining player example for player numerical signal"
local server_average_Elo = 2000
local joining_player_Elo = 1000
local max_relevant_difference = 1500

local diff = math.abs(server_average_Elo - joining_player_Elo)
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
return score
```

<h5>Constant value</h5>

Minimizes the difference between the server's average player attribute and a constant value of 500. Differences beyond 1000 return a signal score of 0.

```lua title="Constant value formula for player numerical signal"
local diff = math.abs(server_sum_{attribute_name} + joining_player_{attribute_name} - constant_value)
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
return score
```

```lua title="Constant value example for player numerical signal"
local server_sum_PowerLevel = 4500
local joining_player_PowerLevel = 9901
local max_relevant_difference = 1500
local constant_value = 5000

local diff = math.abs(server_sum_PowerLevel + joining_player_PowerLevel - constant_value)
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
```

### Player categorical

<h5>Clustering</h5>

Maximizes the ratio of players in the server who have the same attribute as the joining player's attribute.

```lua title="Clustering formula for player categorical signal"
local score = num_players_same_{attribute_name} / occupancy
return score
```

```lua title="Clustering example for player categorical signal"
local num_players_same_Guild = 15
local occupancy = 19

local score = num_players_same_Guild / occupancy
return score
```

<h5>Diversifying</h5>

Maximizes the ratio of players in the server who have a different attribute than the joining player's attribute.

```lua title="Diversifying formula for player categorical signal"
local score = num_players_same_{attribute_name} / occupancy
return 1 - score
```

```lua title="Diversifying example for player categorical signal"
local num_players_same_RpgClass = 15
local occupancy = 19

local score = num_players_same_RpgClass / occupancy
return score
```

### Server numerical

<h5>Joining player</h5>

Minimizes the difference between the server's attribute and the joining player's attribute. Differences beyond 1000 return a signal score of 0.

```lua title="Joining player formula for server numerical signal"
local diff = math.abs(server_{attribute_name} - joining_player_{attribute_name})
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
return score
```

```lua title="Joining player example for player numerical signal"
local server_Level = 4500
local joining_player_Level = 9000
local max_relevant_difference = 1500

local diff = math.abs(server_Level - joining_player_Level)
local score = 1 - math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
```

<h5>Constant value</h5>

Minimizes the difference between the server's attribute value and a constant value. Differences beyond this constant value return a signal score of 0.

```lua title="Constant value formula for server numerical signal"
local diff = math.abs(server_{attribute_name} - constant_value)
local score = math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
return score
```

```lua title="Constant value example for server numerical signal"
local server_GameTime = 500
local max_relevant_difference = 1000
local constant_value = 1000

local diff = math.abs(server_GameTime - constant_value)
local score = math.min(diff / max_relevant_difference, 1)
```

### Server categorical

<h5>Compare to joining player</h5>

The score is 1 when the server's attribute value (for example, Game Mode) is equal to the player's attribute value (for example, Preferred Game Mode). Otherwise, the signal score is 0.

```lua title="Joining player formula for server categorical signal"
if server_{attribute_name} = joining_player_{attribute_name} then
  return 1 
else
  return 0 
end
```

```lua title="Joining player example for server categorical signal"
local server_GameMode = "Survival"
local joining_player_GameMode = "Survival"

if server_GameMode = joining_player_GameMode then
  return 1
else
  return 0
end
```

<h5>Compare to constant value</h5>

The score is 1 when the server's attribute value is equal to a constant value of true. Otherwise, the signal score is 0.

```lua title="Constant value formula for server categorical signal"
if server_{attribute_name} = constant_value then
  return 1 
else
  return 0
end
```

```lua title="Constant value example for server categorical signal"
local server_GameNotStarted = true

if server_GameNotStarted = true then
  return 1
else
  return 0
end
```
