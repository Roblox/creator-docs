title: Customize your matchmaking configuration
description: Use custom matchmaking to match players based on attributes like their skill level, their age and language, and their gameplay preferences.
---

With a custom matchmaking configuration, you can build competitive, cooperative, and unique experiences by matching players to servers based on characteristics like skill level, latency, and gameplay preferences.

By default, Roblox provides you with a matchmaking configuration that uses predefined Roblox signals. To customize matchmaking, you can create new matchmaking configurations by [adjusting the weights of existing Roblox signals](#custom-configuration-with-roblox-signals), [creating new custom signals](#custom-configuration-with-custom-signals), or both. You can then preview your configuration by [previewing server scores with mock servers](#preview-and-test-server-scores).

## Custom configuration with Roblox signals

You can adjust the weights of existing Roblox signals to customize your experience's matchmaking. For more information about Roblox signals and how their formulas are calculated, see [Existing signals](./attributes-and-signals.md#existing-signals).

To create a custom matchmaking configuration using only Roblox signals:

1. In the **Creator Dashboard**, navigate to **Creations**, then select an experience.
2. In the lefthand navigation, navigate to the **Configure** section, then select **Custom Matchmaking**.
3. Select the **Configuration** tab and click **Create Configuration**.
4. In the **Create a Custom Matchmaking Configuration** page, enter a name for your configuration.
5. Change the weights of the Roblox signals you want to update.
6. Click **Save Configuration**.
7. Select the places you want to apply this configuration to.
8. Click **Save Configuration** again.

The new matchmaking configuration shows up in the **Configurations** list of the **Configuration** tab.

### Create a custom signal

<Alert severity="info">
  You can create a total of 2 custom signals per experience.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="info">
  Custom signals use custom attributes to access player and server data. In order to create a custom signal, you must first create a [custom attribute](#create-a-custom-attribute).
</Alert>

Custom signals can be player numerical, server numerical, player categorical, or server categorical. For more information about custom signals and how their formulas are calculated, see [Custom signals](./attributes-and-signals.md#custom-signals).

To create a custom signal:

1. In the **Create a Custom Matchmaking Configuration** page, click **Add Custom Signal**.
2. Under **Signal Details**, enter a signal name and description.
3. Under **Signal Configuration**:

    - For a **player numerical attribute**:
        1. Choose the [attribute](#create-a-custom-attribute) you want to reference.
        2. Select how you want to aggregate the attribute in each server.
            - **Average**: The average of all players' attribute values in the server. Minimizes the difference between the server's average player attribute and the joining player's attribute.
            - **Median**: The median of all players' attribute values in the server. Minimizes the difference between the server's median player attribute and the joining player's attribute.
            - **Sum**: The sum of all players' attribute values in the server, including the joining player's. Minimizes the difference between the total attribute value of the players in the server, including the joining player, and a constant value.
        3. Adjust the values under the aggregation.

    - For a **server numerical attribute**:
        1. Choose the [attribute](#create-a-custom-attribute) you want to reference.
        2. Adjust the values under the attribute.

    - For a **player categorical attribute**:
        1. Choose the [attribute](#create-a-custom-attribute) you want to reference.
        2. Select how you want to distribute the attribute value across servers:
            - **Cluster**: Groups players with the same attribute value. Maximizes the ratio of players in the server who have the same attribute value as the joining player.
            - **Diversify**: Groups players with different attribute values. Maximizes the ratio of players in the server who have a different attribute value from the joining player.

    - For a **server categorical attribute**:
        1. Choose the [attribute](#create-a-custom-attribute) you want to reference.
        2. Adjust the values under the attribute.

4. **(Optional)** Expand **Preview and Test Signal** to preview the signal score. You can adjust the **Test Signal** values to optimize the preview result.

5. Click **Create Signal**.

The new custom signal shows up in the **Configuration** list of the **Create a Custom Matchmaking Configuration** page.

### Create a custom attribute

<Alert severity="info">
  You can create a total of 5 server attributes and 5 player attributes per experience.
</Alert>

Attributes are properties associated with players and servers, like skill level and game mode preferences. If you want to create and use custom signals, you must first create custom attributes. You can create player or server attributes.

For more information about the difference between player and server attributes, see [Custom attributes](./attributes-and-signals.md#custom-attributes).

<h5 style={{marginTop: '48px'}}>Player attributes</h5>

To create a player attribute:

1. In the **Custom Matchmaking** page, select the **Attributes** tab and click **Create Attribute**.
2. In the **Create Attribute** page, select **Player Attribute** and enter a unique name for it.
3. Choose a **Data Type** and a **Default Value** for the attribute.
4. Under **Data Store Settings**, select the data store that the attribute data lives in.
5. Enter a **Data Store Key Template** to store the player attribute values.
6. Enter a **Data Store Value Path** so that matchmaking can locate the player attribute value inside a JSON object in the data store you selected.
7. Enter a **Data Store Scope** to specify the scope. If you don't enter a scope, it defaults to global.
8. Click **Save Changes** to save your player attribute.

## Preview and test server scores

<Alert severity="warning">
  Preview server scores are just examples and don't reflect actual game servers.
</Alert>

Preview and test server scoring to see how your configured signal weights impact server selection. You can experiment with different weight combinations to optimize your matchmaking configuration.

When you create a preview, the preview mocks server scores and identifies which mock server has the highest total score and is the best match for the player.

To preview and test, click **Preview and Test** in the **Create a Custom Matchmaking Configuration** page. The preview shows you three mock servers with different scores and highlights the winning server. To see details about the formulas used for scoring, hover over each signal score result for each mock server.

For more information about scoring and weights, see [Scoring](./scoring.md).

## Apply a configuration to places

You can apply a matchmaking configuration to as many places as you want inside your experience.

To apply a configuration to places:

1. In the **Custom Matchmaking** page, click **Add to Place**.
2. Select a configuration and the place or places you want to apply it to.
3. Click **Save Configuration**.

The places you selected show up in the **Applied Places** list of the **Configuration** tab. You can also add a configuration to places during the creation of that matchmaking configuration.
