## Manage Plugins

The **Manage Plugins** button lets you enable/disable, update, or uninstall plugins you've [installed](../production/creator-store.md#find-assets) from the Creator Store, while the
**Plugins Folder** button opens the local system folder containing plugins you've [created](../studio/plugins.md) or manually installed.

## Localization

The localization **Tools** window lets you playtest in various languages, download `.csv` localization tables, and upload modified `.csv` tables. For more information, see [Localization](../production/localization/index.md).

## View Sounds

The **View Sounds** plugin lets you discover audio used throughout the place and replace audio assets that you do not have permission to use. See [asset privacy](../projects/assets/privacy.md) for details.
