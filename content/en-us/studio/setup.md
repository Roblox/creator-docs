Create immersive 3D experiences on Roblox with **Roblox Studio**, a free application available on Windows and Mac.

## System requirements

<StudioSystemReqs components={props.components} />

## Installation

1. Click the following **Download Studio** button.

   <UseStudioButton variant='blueLogoIconButton' />

1. In the pop-up dialog, click the **Download Studio** button.
1. Find the Studio installer in your browser's download history and double-click the file.

   - On Windows, the file is `RobloxStudio.exe`.
   - On Mac, the file is `RobloxStudio.dmg`.

1. After Studio finishes installing, a pop-up confirmation displays. Click the **Launch&nbsp;Studio** button.

1. Sign in to Studio with your Roblox account (if you don't have an account, create one at [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/)).

## Customization

You can customize Studio to suit your workflow across various levels:

- [Configure the toolbar](../studio/ui-overview.md#toolbar-and-mezzanine) with custom tabs, reorganize tools within custom tabs, hide infrequently used tabs, and more.
- Customize the [window layout](../studio/ui-overview.md#layout-customization) to best suit your workflows.
- View/edit Studio shortcuts and bind actions without defaults through **File**&nbsp;⟩ **Customize&nbsp;Shortcuts**.
- Access a wide array of **Studio Settings** (<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd> on Windows; <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>S</kbd> on Mac). Locate known settings by typing keywords into the search field at the top of the window, for example `theme` to locate the setting for dark theme or light theme.

## Updates

In contrast to certain other engines, every experience runs on the latest version of the Roblox engine. You should keep Studio up‑to‑date to utilize the latest APIs and features.

If your current version of Studio is outdated, you'll see an **Update** button in the upper‑right corner. Clicking the button will prompt you to save/close the currently open place so that Studio can automatically update and restart.

## Beta features

Many beta features are available through Studio's **File**&nbsp;&rang; **Beta&nbsp;Features** menu. Once you've enabled beta features, click the **Save** button and you'll be prompted to restart Studio for the features to take effect.
