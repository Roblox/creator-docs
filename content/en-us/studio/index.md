**Build anything you can imagine with the all-in-one IDE for Roblox.**

Roblox Studio is an all-in-one IDE that lets you create experiences that run on
Roblox. It's free to use and lets you reach millions of users using
the Roblox app on console, desktop, and mobile devices.

## Powerful 3D Building Tools

<figure>
Create almost anything you can imagine by combining [parts](../parts/index.md) and [meshes](../parts/meshes.md) into models with built-in [materials](../parts/materials.md) or your own textures.

Overlay or integrate [user interface](../ui/index.md) components like text labels and buttons, billboards, and inventory screens to provide more ways for users to interact with your experiences.

Build or generate large scale [terrains](../parts/terrain.md) consisting of water, desert, mountains, and more to give your creations an intimate or large scale feeling. Take your experiences to the next level by adjusting [lighting](../environment/lighting.md) and [atmosphere](../environment/atmosphere.md), integrating [audio](../sound/index.md), and applying [special effects](../effects/index.md).

## Integrated Scripting, Debugging, and Testing

<figure>
Roblox comes with a host of built-in features like matchmaking and [physics](../physics/index.md), but scripting specific features is essential to making your experiences unique. Studio provides full access to the [Roblox Engine APIs](/reference/engine) through a full-featured [script editor](../studio/script-editor.md) with modern conveniences like autocompletion and code highlighting.

Built-in [debugging](../studio/debugging.md) and profiling lets you catch errors and tune performance so your experiences run at their best on all devices.

Finally, you can test directly in Studio through multiple [testing and emulation](../studio/testing-modes.md) modes.

## Fast Publishing and Updating

<figure>
Roblox not only provides the engine and tooling, but gives you access to a large social network of users on a broad array of devices. Just click to [publish](../production/publishing/index.md) and your experiences are automatically available to this network with built-in [discovery](../production/promotion/discovery.md) and [monetization](../production/monetization/index.md) opportunities. Want to iterate on your experience? Make the changes and update them immediately for all users in an instant.

## Collaborative and Extensible

<figure>
Studio has built-in [collaboration](../projects/collaboration.md) tools so you and your co-creators can build on your own time or together in real-time. Drag and drop parts to a shared workspace where changes appear to everyone at the same time, chat with your team in real-time, and have all your changes saved and managed in the cloud.

You can also extend the feature set of Studio with custom [plugins](../studio/plugins.md), or build your own plugins to share with the rest of the Roblox community.
