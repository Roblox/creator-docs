title: Avatar Settings
description: The Avatar Settings window contains all Studio-level settings and customization options for an experience.
---

The **Avatar Settings** window allows you to control the look and behavior of user avatars across your entire experience.

Most experiences will find that the default avatar settings work perfectly right out of the box, offering a seamless player experience. The extensive controls in Avatar Settings are primarily for advanced creators looking to finely tune avatar appearance and behavior for specific gameplay needs.

<Alert severity="warning">
Avatar Settings modifies underlying experience defaults that are not visible outside of the settings interface or accessible with scripts. This can lead to difficult-to-debug behaviors, especially when working across teams or on a universe with multiple place files.

Test your changes by using the Avatar Settings preview and by playtesting in Studio so that you fully understand the impact on player avatars before publishing changes to your live experience.

## Top bar

The top bar of the Avatar Settings window provides easy access to quickly set the Avatar Type, assign a preset, and enable preview.

## General

The **General** tab offers simple presets tailored to the needs of most experiences. In many cases, one of these presets will fit your experience's avatar use-cases and additional configuration is not necessary. However, advanced developers can further customize avatar behavior using the more detailed settings available in the other tabs.
