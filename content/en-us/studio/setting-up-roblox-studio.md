- **Mac** &ndash; macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and above.
- **Processor** &ndash; Processor with a clock speed of 1.6 GHz or better.
- **RAM** &ndash; 4 GB of system memory.
- **Hard Disk** &ndash; At least 10 GB of available hard disk space after installation.
- **Graphics Card** &ndash; A computer less than 5 years old with a dedicated video card or a laptop less than 3 years old with an integrated video card.
- **Internet Access** &ndash; At least 4-8 MB/s to keep Studio up-to-date and save projects to your Roblox account.

   - On Mac, the file is `RobloxStudio.dmg`.

1. After Studio finishes installing, a pop-up confirmation displays. Click the **Launch&nbsp;Studio** button.

1. Sign in to Studio with your Roblox account. If you don't have an account, create one at [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/) and follow the tips on [securing your account](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313380-Account-Security-Theft-Keeping-your-Account-Safe-).

## Updating Studio

In contrast to certain other engines, every experience runs on the latest version of the Roblox engine. You should keep Studio up-to-date to utilize the latest APIs and features.

If your current version of Studio is outdated, you'll see an **Update Available** button in the upper-right corner. Clicking the button will prompt you to save/close the currently open place so that Studio can automatically update and restart.
