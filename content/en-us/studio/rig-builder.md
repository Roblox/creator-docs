The **Rig Generator** tool lets you quickly insert basic pre-built character rigs into your experience. You can also insert a rig of your account's avatar character, including character customizations and accessories. The tool inserts character `Class.Model|Models` with the appropriate joints and humanoid structure to support [animation](../animation/index.md), [accessories](../art/accessories/index.md), and [character customizations](../characters/appearance.md).

1. From the toolbar's **Avatar** or **Home** tab, click **Character**.

1. From the popup, select from the available options. You can insert either a legacy **R6** rig consisting of 6 mesh objects, or an **R15** rig which consists of 15 mesh objects and significantly expands upon the R6's limited motion range.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   Note that you can only equip clothing and other layerable accessories to **R15** models.
   </Alert>

1. Choose a body shape of either **Masculine** or **Feminine** and then click one of the style buttons. The rig displays both in the 3D viewport and in the [Explorer](../studio/explorer.md) window under the name **Rig**.
