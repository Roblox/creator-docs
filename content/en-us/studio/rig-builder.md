The **Rig Builder** tool lets you quickly insert basic pre-built character rigs into your experience. You can also insert a rig of your account's avatar character, including character customizations and accessories. The tool inserts character `Class.Model|Models` with the appropriate joints and humanoid structure to support [animation](../animation/index.md), [accessories](../art/accessories/index.md), and [character customizations](../characters/appearance.md).

You can insert all pre-built rig types directly from the popup into your viewport.

1. From the toolbar's **Avatar** tab, click **Rig Builder**.
1. From the popup, select from the available options. You can insert two rig types into your experience: **R6** is a legacy rig made up of 6 mesh objects, while **R15** consists of 15 mesh objects, significantly expanding the R6's limited motion range.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   Note that you can only equip clothing and other layerable accessories to **R15** models.
   </Alert>

1. Choose a body shape of either **Masculine** or **Feminine** and then click one of the style buttons. The rig displays both in the 3D viewport and in the [Explorer](../studio/explorer.md) window under the name **Rig**.
