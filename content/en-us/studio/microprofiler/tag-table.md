description: Tag Table is a list of tags for the MicroProfiler.
---

The following is a list of tags given by [MicroProfiler](../../studio/microprofiler/index.md), separated by type. Understanding these tags will help in determining the cause and identifying potential solutions for unoptimized code.The tables contain tag label, descriptions and performance advice for improving performance and optimizing your experience.

    <td>computePath</td>
    <td>
    Calculates paths, typically after `rasterizeTile`.

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepare</td>
    <td>Information is gathered from the main thread and updates various data structures used for rendering. This blocks the simulation threads, so it should be as small as possible.</td>
    <td>See Prepare labels below.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepare/Pass3dAdorn</td>
    <td>Rendering various object adorns, such as text labels above objects. This step may include raycasting to determine if such objects are visible.</td>
    <td>Reduce the number of visible adorned objects, such as `Class.BillboardGui|BillboardGuis`, `Class.Humanoid` name/health labels, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepare/Pass2D</td>
    <td>Readies 2D UI rendering (both player and Roblox UI).</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepare/UpdateInvalidParts</td>

    <td>Prepares geometry, typically "FastClusters" used to render `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids`. Sub-markers specify the number of parts, vertices, and size of vertices.</td>
    <td>Reduce the use of 'Humanoids' under objects that are not `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids`. This should not be used to shorten draw calls as FastClusters consume much more memory.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prepare/UpdateDynamicParts</td>
    <td>Updates positions for `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids`, vehicles and other moving instances for rendering.</td>
    <td>Reduce the number or complexity of moving `Class.Humanoid|Humanoids` or vehicles visible. Combining parts of the same material and color into a union or MeshPart can help with this.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Prepare/updateInstancedClusters</td>
    <td>Prepares static geometry that uses instanced rendering (parts and mesh parts). Labels "Clusters" and "Instances" indicate the number updated.</td>

    <td>See Perform labels below.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perform/Scene/queryFrustumOrdered</td>
    <td>Applies frustum culling so that objects not visible are not rendered.</td>

    <td>Computation of lighting near the camera.</td>
    <td>Manipulate the number of light sources or move the camera less to reduce the time it takes to recalculate lighting.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Perform/ Scene/ ComputeLightingPerform/UpdateLightGrid</td>
    <td>Updates the voxel lighting. Lights are only rendered in Voxel Lighting mode, but occupancy and sky light are computed in all lighting modes.</td>
    <td>If updating chunk occupancy takes too long, consider using lower resolution geometry, or reducing the number of parts. If the other sub-markers take too long, consider reducing the number of lights. Consider using non-shadow casting geometry for objects that move and invalidate the occupancy.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perform/Present</td>
    <td>Waits for the GPU to finish rendering the previous frame; actually issues rendering commands to GPU; deals with low-level graphics resources.</td>
    <td>Reduce scene complexity in general. If this step is taking a long time, you may be limited by the GPU.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perform/Present/waitUntilCompleted</td>
    <td>Waits for the GPU to finish rendering the previous frame.</td>
    <td>If this is generally happening a lot then the amount of things rendered is too high. FRM helps with balancing this, but if it remains high, try to use less detail.</td>
