The **Developer Console** is a tool for debugging your experience when testing in Studio or running it in production. It shows log messages and errors similar to the [Output](../studio/output.md) window and detailed information on [Memory](#memory), [Network](#network), and more.

## Opening the Console

The **Developer Console** is accessible while [testing](../studio/testing-modes.md) or running an experience in the following ways:

- Press <kbd>F9</kbd>.
- Type `/console` into the chat.
- Use the in-experience menu:
  1. Open the in-experience **Roblox Menu**.

  2. Select the **Settings** tab.
  3. Scroll down to **Developer Console** and click **Open**.

## Console Sections

The shortcut bar at the top of the console shows the number of critical errors and warnings, client memory usage, and average ping time; click any of these to jump to its corresponding section in the console. Below the shortcut bar is a series of tools as outlined below.

### Log

The **Log** tool shows diagnostic messages from scripts.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Client/Server Toggle">

Using the client-server switch, you can toggle between **Client** and **Server** views:

- The **Client** view shows output from client-side `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts` and/or `Class.Script|Scripts` with `Class.Script.RunContext|RunContext` set to `Enum.RunContext.Client`. Anyone running an experience can view local output messages.
- The **Server** view shows output from server-side `Class.Script|Scripts` (`Class.Script.RunContext|RunContext` set to `Enum.RunContext.Client` or `Enum.RunContext.Legacy`). Only the experience owner or [group](../projects/groups.md) members with editing permission can view server output messages.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Output Filters">

Using the checkboxes, you can filter output messages in the log:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**Output**</td>
      <td>Messages generated by calls to `Global.LuaGlobals.print()` and `Global.RobloxGlobals.warn()` statements within scripts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Information**</td>
      <td>Messages generated by the experience that aren't errors or custom output statements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Warning**</td>
      <td>Messages that indicate a potential problem but not a critical issue.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**Error**</td>
      <td>Messages that indicate that something critical has happened.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Command Bar">

The **Server** view also includes a command bar that lets users with editing permissions run arbitrary Luau code. Unlike the [Command Bar](../studio/ui-overview.md#command-bar) in Studio, this console command bar has the same security restrictions as `Class.Script|Scripts` and `Class.LocalScript|LocalScripts`, so it can't run protected functions.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Memory

The **Memory** tool shows metrics on memory usage. Models, terrain, parts, visual effects, scripts, physical contraptions, audio, and more can all contribute to total memory usage. The **Memory** tool has the following section:

- **CoreMemory** &mdash; Memory used by processes built into the Roblox engine such as networking, avatars, and GUI elements.
- **PlaceMemory** &mdash; Memory that scales as a direct result of choices made as an experience is built.
- **UntrackedMemory** &mdash; Arbitrary memory allocations that are not tagged.
- **PlaceScriptMemory** &mdash; Memory used by user Luau script threads. This section includes script names and custom memory tags.
- **CoreScriptMemory** &mdash; Memory used by internal Roblox script threads.

**PlaceMemory** section has sub-categories. The following table describes each sub-category and tips for reducing memory usage.

<table size="small">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Memory Management Tips</th>

### Network

The **Network** tool shows the number of web calls that the experience has made. This includes explicit calls made through `Class.HttpService` and web requests made by Roblox services like `Class.DataStoreService`. The **Network** tool has two sections:

- The **Summary** section lists a summary of all the web calls by type. Each type has details on the number of requests, the number of failed requests, and the amount of time that the request took.

- The **Details** section lists each individual web call. Each row shows the HTTP method, such as `GET` or `POST`, along with the status code, time to execute, request type, and request URL. Click on a web call to see its response details, for example:

  <figure>
	<figcaption>
	\{"Version":"1.1":"Content":\{"Headers":\[\]\},"StatusCode":"OK","ReasonPhrase":"OK","Headers":\[\],"TrailingHeaders":\[\],"RequestMessage":null,"IsSuccessStatusCode":true\}
	</figcaption>
	</figure>

### Script Profiler

**Script Profiler** tool allows you to record profiling sessions of all running scripts and view their CPU time costs with custom recording and display settings. It's helpful for identifying scripts that take up the most CPU resources and slow down the performance. For more information, see [Script Profiler](../studio/optimization/scriptprofiler.md).
