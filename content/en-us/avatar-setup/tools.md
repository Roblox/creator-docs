Use Avatar Setup's [preview and testing tools](#preview) to ensure your character moves, animates, equips accessories, and looks as expected.

Avatar Setup also provides tools for [minor editing and adjustments](#edit-tools) that allow you to make minor to moderate changes to your model. Major fixes may require you to make your adjustments in your third-party modeling software and re-export.

### Equip items

Selected items are equipped on the avatar and are added to the currently equipped column on the right side. Selected animations begin playing as a preview of how they'll look in a running experience.

To unequip an item, click it again in the selection column, press the **X** button at the top right of the equipped item, or right-click the asset in the Equipped column and select **Unequip**. You can also drag and order the various equipped accessories to set the worn order.

### Add items

The add item button allows you to add custom assets to the tool's palette for testing.

To add an item to the palette:

1. Select a valid **Accessory** or **Body Part** asset from the Explorer or 3D workspace.
2. Click the add item button at the bottom of the selection column along the left side of the window.

3. The item appears in the appropriate section and subsection of the Check Body interface, such as **Accessories** â†’ **Hair**.

### Test in experience

The **Test in Experience** button starts playtesting the experience with the previewed avatar. Any changes made in the Avatar setup preview tools, such as equipped clothing or accessories, or modifications, such as skin tone or body part swaps, do not transfer over to the playable character model in this mode.

## Edit tools

Use the Avatar Setup tool to make quick adjustments to your model and any generated assets.
