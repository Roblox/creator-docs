A **comment** is text that the Luau parser ignores at runtime.

## Single-line Comments

You can define single-line comments with a double hyphen (`--`) anywhere outside a string. Single-line comments extend to the end of the line.

Use single line comments for in-line notes. If the comment spans multiple lines, use multiple single-line comments.

You can add and remove single-line comments in the Script Editor with the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>/</kbd> (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>/</kbd>).

```lua
-- This condition is really important because the world would blow up if it
-- were missing.
if not foo then
    stopWorldFromBlowingUp()
end
```

## Block Comments

You can define multiline block comments with double hyphens and double brackets (`--[[]]`). Use block comments for documenting items:

- Use a block comment at the top of files to describe their purpose.
- Use a block comment before functions or objects to describe their intent.

```lua
--[[
    Shuts off the cosmic moon ray immediately.

    Should only be called within 15 minutes of midnight Mountain Standard
    Time, or the cosmic moon ray may be damaged.
]]
local function stopCosmicMoonRay()
end
```

If necessary, you can nest multiple brackets inside a block comment using the same number of equal signs in both the beginning and ending bracket:

```lua
--[=[
    In-depth detail about cosmic moon ray: [[[TOP SECRET]]]
]=]
```

## TODO Comments

Roblox Studio supports special `TODO` comments. Studio bolds any text following `TODO` (until broken by a space):

```lua
-- TODO: Finish the function below so that it actually does what its name implies.
local function stopWorldFromBlowingUp()
end
```

Use `TODO` comments to keep track of and communicate issues within your code.
