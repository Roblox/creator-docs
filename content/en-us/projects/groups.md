title: Group Collaboration
description: Explains Roblox groups and how to collaborate with multiple creators on the same experience.
---

A Roblox **group** allows multiple creators to work on the same experience, use the same assets, share profits, and give credit to all contributors.

<Alert severity="warning">
Group ownership of experiences helps creators collaborate and operate as independent studios. If a conflict arises within a group, Roblox cannot help arbitrate or resolve disagreements.
</Alert>

## Creating a New Group

Creating a group costs 100 Robux. New groups maintain certain capabilities on the legacy [Groups](https://www.roblox.com/groups) pages, but improved workflows and options for [configuring roles/permissions](#roles-and-permissions) and [inviting members](#inviting-members) are only available on the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations).

To create a new group:

1. Navigate to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) and select **Create&nbsp;Group** from the **View&nbsp;As** dropdown menu.

2. On the setup page, upload an image for the group logo and enter the group name.
3. When ready, click the **Purchase** button. Once the group is created, you'll be directed to the group profile page where you can modify the group's details, including adding up to three social links.

## Roles and Permissions

Group members can be assigned one or multiple **roles** within a group, and each role has **permissions** which specify the abilities of its members.

<Alert severity="warning">
Role configuration is only accessible if you're the group owner or you have permission to create, configure, and assign group roles.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="error">
Roles created using the legacy [Groups](https://www.roblox.com/groups) pages will continue to operate on the legacy system and can only be managed through the legacy workflow. If permissions were granted to a legacy role, **the member will continue to have those permissions**, so it's recommended that you revoke permissions/roles in the legacy system and then migrate members to the new system.
</Alert>

1. From the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations), select the group from the **View&nbsp;As** dropdown menu and navigate to **Collaboration**&nbsp;&rang; **Roles**.

   <img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Nav-Collaboration-Roles.png" width="280" alt="Roles option indicated in the Collaboration section on the Creator Dashboard." />

2. For each role, carefully confirm the permissions under the **Permissions** tab.

   <Alert severity="info">
   A role's **Settings** section is also where group owners and members with sufficient permissions can remove a role entirely through the **Delete&nbsp;Role** button.
   </Alert>

## Managing Members

Once [roles](#roles-and-permissions) have been configured for the group, members can be invited and assigned from the **Collaboration**&nbsp;&rang; **Members** page.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Nav-Collaboration-Members.png" width="280" alt="Members option indicated in the Collaboration section on the Creator Dashboard." />

<Alert severity="warning">
Member configuration is only accessible if you're the group owner or you have permission to manage other members and their roles.
</Alert>

### Inviting Members

You can invite new members through the **Invite** button in the upper‑right corner.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Members-Invite-Button.png" width="880" alt="Invite button indicated in the group's Members section on the Creator Dashboard." />

From the popup, locate a creator by typing their username into the search field. Creators will be notified when invited to your group (a customizable setting within the creator notification system), or you can copy the **group link** and share it with invited creators through other means.

### Assigning Roles

To assign one or more roles to a member, hover over their name, click the **&#8942;** button, and then click the **&CirclePlus;** button for the desired role.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Members-Assign-Role.png" width="880" alt="Roles management popup window showing how to assign a role to a group member on the Creator Dashboard." />

To quickly un-assign a role from the members overview, hover over it and click the **&CircleTimes;** button.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Members-Un-Assign-Role.png" width="880" alt="Hover-over showing how to un-assign a role from a group member on the Creator Dashboard." />

<Alert severity="error">
Currently, roles configured through the legacy [Groups](https://www.roblox.com/groups) pages appear for each member, and new members are assigned the legacy **Member** role. If permissions were granted to a role through the legacy system, **the member will continue to have those permissions**, so it's recommended that you revoke permissions/roles in the legacy system and then migrate members to the new system.
</Alert>

### Removing Members

To remove a member entirely, hover over their name and click the "trash" button. A dialog will appear for you to confirm their removal.

## Managing Payouts

If you're the owner of a selected group, you'll find a **Payouts** page under **Finances**. Here, you can send one‑time payouts, as well as define percentage splits with other members.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Nav-Finances-Payouts.png" width="280" alt="Payouts option indicated in the Finances section on the Creator Dashboard." />

<Alert severity="info">
Some groups may not have this page unlocked initially for various reasons, such as the group having no funds to payout.
</Alert>

### One-Time Payouts

Group owners can make one-time payouts to members in a batch, selecting a set amount for each. Safety features include 2FA challenges, confirmation dialogues, and checks around the eligibility of members being paid.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Payouts-One-Time.png" width="880" alt="One-time payout button indicated in the Payouts section on the Creator Dashboard." />

### Recurring Payouts

Group owners can also define recurring payouts across the entire group **and** per‑experience, assigning a percentage payout to each member before the remainder enters the group's overall balance.

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Payouts-Split-Options.png" width="880" alt="Split payout buttons indicated in the Payouts section on the Creator Dashboard." />

Consider the following scenario where a group experience "Laser&nbsp;Maze" is split 40%&ndash;30%&ndash;10% among three members, with a remainder of 20%.

<br />
<Grid container spacing={2}>
	<Grid item xs={2} sm={1} md={1} lg={1}><img src="../assets/misc/Box-Label-A.png" width="40" style={{float:"right"}} /></Grid>
	<Grid item xs={10} sm={11} md={11} lg={11} style={{marginTop:"4px"}}>
	Assuming the experience earns 1000 Robux, the three members receive 400, 300, and 100 Robux respectively (40%&ndash;30%&ndash;10%).
	</Grid>
</Grid>
<Grid container spacing={2}>
	<Grid item xs={2} sm={1} md={1} lg={1}><img src="../assets/misc/Box-Label-B.png" width="40" style={{float:"right"}} /></Grid>
	<Grid item xs={10} sm={11} md={11} lg={11} style={{marginTop:"4px"}}>
	The remaining 200 Robux &mdash; 20% of the experience split&nbsp;&mdash; passes onward to the **group split** percentages, defined at 20%&ndash;20%&ndash;10% among the same three members; they receive an additional 40, 40, and 20 Robux respectively.
	</Grid>
</Grid>
<Grid container spacing={2}>
	<Grid item xs={2} sm={1} md={1} lg={1}><img src="../assets/misc/Box-Label-C.png" width="40" style={{float:"right"}} /></Grid>
	<Grid item xs={10} sm={11} md={11} lg={11} style={{marginTop:"4px"}}>
	The remaining 100 Robux &mdash; 50% of the group split&nbsp;&mdash; is placed in the group's overall balance.
	</Grid>
</Grid>

<img src="../assets/creator-dashboard/Group-Payouts-Splits-Example.png" width="840" alt="Example flowchart of how experience splits are distributed to group members first, with remainder going factored into group splits for final distribution among the group." />

<Alert severity="warning">
Note that revenue from [private server](../production/monetization/private-servers.md) subscriptions does not change if you adjust split percentages at a later time, meaning that if a player buys a private server subscription, the split percentages at time of purchase will apply to that particular subscription forever (until it is canceled). This policy may be changed in the future.
</Alert>

## Intellectual Property Protection in Groups

Group members with permission to edit all group experiences can enable the [Place Copying](../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md#allowing-copying) setting for a creation, potentially allowing the entire Roblox community to copy it and use assets within it. To help protect intellectual property in a group, the owner or members with sufficient permissions should:

- Confirm that each member is [assigned the appropriate role](#assigning-roles).
- Check that each group role has the correct [permissions](#roles-and-permissions).
- Confirm that [Place Copying](../production/publishing/publishing-experiences-and-places.md#allowing-copying) is disabled before private assets are added.
