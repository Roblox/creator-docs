description: Rules and owner accountability for Roblox groups.
---

If you are the owner of one or more [groups](./groups.md), carefully read through the following expectations for managing your groups.

## Roblox rules

Roblox groups and **all content uploaded to them** must follow Roblox's [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards) and [Terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;Use](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use). Content uploaded to groups that is subject to the Community Standards includes, but is not limited to:

- Assets
- Avatars
- Experiences

## Owner accountability

Group owners play a crucial role in maintaining a safe and positive environment within their groups.

- Group owners should make a reasonable effort to address and mitigate harmful behavior within their communities and groups.
- Group owners are responsible for utilizing Roblox-provided moderation tools such as [activity history](./groups.md#group-activity-history) to proactively ensure a healthy environment and moderate potentially violative content.

## Violations and consequences

Groups that violate Roblox's [Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards) may face enforcement actions such as warnings, restrictions on features, temporary locks, and&nbsp;&mdash; for repeat or severe violations&nbsp;&mdash; permanent removal. Group owners can [appeal](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000245263-Appeal-Your-Content-or-Account-Moderation) any enforcement actions if they believe they were incorrect.

- **Member Violations** — While group owners are not **directly** penalized for member violations, repeated failure to address violations within a group can result in future restrictions on group ownership. An owner whose group is permanently removed will not be able to own a new group for 90 days. Multiple permanent removals will result in a complete loss of group ownership privileges for the owner.
- **Owner Violations** — Group owners who are found to be using their group to promote or facilitate violations of Roblox's Community Standards (through uploading or encouraging the upload of violative content) will face enforcement actions on their own accounts and possibly the permanent deletion of their group.
