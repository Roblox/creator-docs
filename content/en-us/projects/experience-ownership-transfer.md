title: Experience ownership transfer
description: Transfer ownership of an experience to other Roblox users or groups.
---

With **experience ownership transfer**, you can transfer your experiences to [groups](./groups.md) you have publish access to. This unlocks all of the features available to groups, including permissions and revenue management, and allows you to efficiently manage your content as your team scales and your priorities shift.

## Prerequisites

Before making a transfer or accepting a transfer, you must first:

- Verify your email address.
- Upload your private `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` to the group you're transferring the experience to. If the experience uses packages where the package owner is a user and not a group, you might have to recreate those packages or replace them with packages that are already owned by a group.
- Publish your animation assets to the group you're transferring the experience to.

  - If you have a large number of animations to upload, you can use a community-supported third-party tool like [Roblox Animation Transfer](https://github.com/evaera/roblox-animation-transfer). See [Transfer animations](./transfer-animations.md) for more details.
  - If you have a small number of animations to upload, you can manually re-upload them and then update your animation asset references to support old and new IDs based on the `CreatorID` and `CreatorType`. See the following code for an example:

  ```lua
  -- Maps animation IDs that belong to the original creator to animation IDs
  -- that belong to the new creator.
  local transferAnimationMap = {
  	["6406676108"] = 14292200298,
  	["6438293322"] = 14292082312,
  	["6464978998"] = 14292224322,
  	["6465240715"] = 14292226967,
  	["6465244287"] = 14292229476,
  	["6382318344"] = 14292213468,
  	["6382564692"] = 14292207171,
  	["6460651769"] = 14292098870,
  	["6415507655"] = 14292218236,
  	["6415509331"] = 14292221034
  }

  function mapTransferAnimationId(id)

  	-- If experience has been transferred, maps old animation IDs to new
  	if game:GetService("RunService"):IsStudio() or
  	(game.CreatorType == Enum.CreatorType.Group and
  		game.CreatorId == 32626384) then
  			local animationId = string.match(id, "%d+$")
  			local mappedId = transferAnimationMap[animationId]

  			if mappedId then
  				return "rbxassetid://" .. mappedId
  			end
  	end

  	return id
  end

  -- Creates an animation instance associated with the
  -- specified rbxassetid://<animation_id>
  function createAnimation(id)
  	local animation = Instance.new("Animation")
  	animation.AnimationId = mapTransferAnimationId(id)

  	return animation
  end
  ```

<Alert severity="info">
As a best practice, if you're using Open Cloud API keys for the experience, create an API key as the new owner with the name `RobloxTransferApiKey`. During the transfer, the relevant scopes are added to this new key and removed from the original key. You can then use a feature flag to allow your backend services to start using the new key after the transfer is complete.

## Transfer an experience

To transfer an experience to a group:

1. Go to [Creations](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) and choose the experience you want to transfer.
2. Go to **Configure** ‚ü© **Settings**.
3. Click **Initiate ownership transfer**.
4. In the **Transfer Details** dialog, carefully read and acknowledge the implications of the transfer. Then, click **Next**.
5. Select a group to transfer the experience to. You must be able to publish experiences to this group.
6. Verify the transfer by entering the experience name.
7. Click **Initiate transfer**. The **Content Settings** page updates to include the pending group's username.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   Once the group accepts the transfer, Roblox makes your experience private and closes all servers associated with it. The transfer process typically completes in a few minutes but may take longer for complex experiences.

3. Verify the transfer by entering the experience name.
4. Click **Accept transfer**.
