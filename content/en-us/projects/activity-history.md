description: Activity History is a log of key configuration, publish, and edit activities within a place.
---

**Activity History** is a shared log of key changes within an experience. Each entry tells you what changed, who changed it, and when they made the change.

1. From Studio's **Window** menu, open **Activity History**. Events are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent appearing first.

1. If you have a large number of events, you can filter them by type or collaborator.
1. If you want to manage the configuration or get more details on a change, use the **&ctdot;** menu next to each event to get a link to the setting in either Studio or the Creator Hub.

## Event reference

Most events are visible in both Studio and the experience's **Activity History** page on the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations), although some are only visible in one location or the other.
