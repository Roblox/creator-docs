  The **Activity History** view in Roblox Studio is a shared log of key changes within your experience. Each entry tells you:

  <ul>
    <li>What changed</li>
    <li>Who changed it</li>
    <li>When they made the change</li>
  </ul>
  </Grid>

You can find similar information in the **Activity History** page for your experience on the [Creator Hub](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations), although the two views have some differences. See the [Event Reference](#event-reference).

## Working with Activity History

To open the Activity History view in Studio, your experience must be saved to Roblox.

1. In the **View** tab, select **Activity History**. Events are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent appearing first.
1. If you have a large number of events, you can filter them by type or collaborator.
1. If you want to manage the configuration or get more details on a change, use the **&ctdot;** menu next to each event to get a link to the setting in either Studio or the Creator Hub.
