Roblox offers a variety of tools to help you build a team and facilitate collaboration. You can manage a team through the [Groups](#developing-in-groups) feature, and you can source and hire team members for a project through either the [Talent Hub](https://talent.roblox.com/) or the [Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com).

<Alert severity='warning'>

Not every project will require the efforts of an entire team. Scaling a development team can be challenging and few developers may be able to earn real money. Remember that you can still enjoy creating on the platform without financial goals.

</Alert>

## Developing in Groups

A [group](../projects/groups.md) allows multiple creators to work on the same experience, use the same assets, and share profits. When you create a group, you automatically create a page for that group which can be used as a [marketing tool](#marketing-with-groups). Consider your experiences as a group even if you're currently developing alone, as you cannot switch later from publishing solo to publishing through a group.

### Managing Groups

Each member of a group is assigned a **role** by the group admin, giving them access to assets, development places, and profits. As such, only members of your development team should have high-level access to your group.

You can also create custom role sets. One common use case for a custom role is to create roles for beta testers. For instance, you can invite specific users into the group who have access to play the experience, but not to open the experience's project in Roblox Studio. For information on creating and setting up groups, see [Groups Collaboration](../projects/groups.md).

### Marketing with Groups

Groups can also serve as a form of marketing for the experiences you publish through them. Users playing an experience will often **engage** with the **creator** of the experience, which in this case is the group page. Here, users can find social links, follow related groups for new content, and post on comment boards.

Studios should follow these recommendations to ensure they leverage their group's promotional potential:

1. Ensure your group is **named** after your studio or company.
2. Use group thumbnails and descriptions to communicate your brand and identity.
3. Include **social links**, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Discord.

<Alert severity='warning'>

Users will often check group pages for new content, which could potentially reveal an **unreleased** but public project. If you want to keep your other projects secret on your group page, disable the "Group experiences are visible on the group home page" setting on your Group's Configure page.

</Alert>

## Building Teams

When building a team, consider your structure carefully and be careful of scaling up too soon. When you do scale up, it's best to hire directly from the Roblox community rather than migrating developers from other platforms or languages. Individuals in the community deeply understand the platform and can offer technical expertise and platform knowledge.

### Team Structure

Every team is different, and every project has different targets for complexity, timeline and genre. Regardless, the following recommendations are based on some **commonalities** in teams creating top Roblox experiences. Please note that by applying these techniques and considerations you are not guaranteed success, but you don't need to have any earning or scaling targets to have fun creating a Roblox experience.

- Start with a **small team** (less than 10), and scale up as a project gains traction. Larger teams are less flexible and unlikely to be sustainable without huge early success.

- At a smaller scale, model your staffing on **mobile development teams**. For instance, for a small six-person team in the early stages of development, you could have:

  - 2 Programmers
  - 1 3D Modeler/Level Designer
  - 1 2D Artist
  - 1 Game Designer
  - 1 Producer or Project Manager

- Wait until you **scale up** to hire more **specialized** roles, such as community managers or QA testers. Studios interested in running [live ops](../production/earning-on-roblox.md#live-ops) will need a larger team to keep up with the update cadence.

### Finding Talent

Roblox provides multiple ways of hiring talent from the developer community. You can find team members, such as programmers and artists, as well as specialized roles such as community managers on the [Talent Hub](https://talent.roblox.com/). On this hiring board, you can post jobs and users can search for others looking for work. You can recruit team members for contract work or full time positions. Some developers will also network on the [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/), but this is more informal and less specific to hiring.

Studios new to working on Roblox will benefit from hiring individuals with **platform experience**. Their knowledge in both development and Roblox culture can provide guidance at every stage. Some community members may request payment in Robux using [group payouts](../projects/groups.md#managing-payouts) through [Developer Exchange](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/devex).

## Example Job Postings

The following criteria for different roles are based on research from top Roblox studios. Feel free to include and adapt them for your own postings.

- Strong skills in math, such as vector math or physics calculations.

### UI/UX Positions

Includes jobs such as UI designer, UI/UX designer and UI programmer.
