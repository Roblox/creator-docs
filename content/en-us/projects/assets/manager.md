import BetaAlert from '../../includes/beta-features/beta-alert.md'

The **Asset Manager** lets you manage [places](../../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md) and bulk import assets into your experience, including [images](../../parts/textures-decals.md), [meshes](../../parts/meshes.md), [packages](../../projects/assets/packages.md), [audio](../../sound/assets.md), and [models](../../parts/models.md).

<img src="../../assets/studio/general/View-Tab-Asset-Manager.png" width="776" alt="Studio's View tab with the Asset Manager button highlighted." />

## Current

<Alert severity="info">
The following sections outline the current Asset Manager. The [V2 Beta](#v2-beta) is documented below.
</Alert>

### Asset folders

Assets are organized within folders based on their type. You can switch between **grid view** and **list view** by clicking the view toggle button.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/View-Toggle.png" width="460" alt="The Asset Manager window with the View toggle button highlighted." />

### Importing assets

The **bulk import** tool is ideal for importing up to 50 files in one batch. Imported assets enter the moderation queue and are only visible to you within their respective [folder](#asset-folders) and within the **Inventory** tab of the [Toolbox](../../projects/assets/toolbox.md).

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Import-Button-V1.png" alt="The Asset Manager window with the Bulk Import button highlighted." width="360" />

    <th>Details</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Image**</td>
    <td>You can import images in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.tga`, or `.bmp` format for use as [textures/decals](../../parts/textures-decals.md) on parts, [image labels](../../ui/labels.md), [mesh textures](../../parts/meshes.md#adding-textures), textures for [custom materials](../../parts/materials.md), textures for [special effects](../../environment/index.md#special-effects), and more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mesh**</td>
    <td>You can bulk import meshes in either `.fbx` or `.obj` format, although this workflow does not support complex meshes such as those with rigging, skinning, or animation data. For complex meshes, it's recommended that you use the [3D&nbsp;Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Audio**</td>
    <td>You can import audio assets that you are certain you have permission to use in `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.wav` format. If you're uncertain whether you have permission to use an audio file, the [Creator Store](../../production/creator-store.md) has a variety of free-to-use audio, including more than 100,000 professionally-produced sound effects. See [Audio Assets](../../sound/assets.md) for details.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Insert assets

You can insert assets into the [Explorer](../../studio/explorer.md) window hierarchy by dragging-and-dropping or by right-clicking the asset name/tile and selecting **Insert**.

Behavior of dragging-and-dropping into the 3D viewport varies by asset type:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Asset&nbsp;Type</th>
    <th>Drag-and-Drop Behavior</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Image**</td>
    <td>If hovering over a valid parent object like a `Class.BasePart`, creates a new `Class.Decal` inside that parent with its `Class.Decal.Texture|Texture` property preset to the asset ID.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mesh**</td>
    <td>Inserts the asset as a new `Class.MeshPart` in the workspace with its `Class.MeshPart.MeshId|MeshId` property preset to the asset ID.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Audio**</td>
    <td>Creates a new `Class.Sound` object in the workspace with its `Class.Sound.SoundId|SoundId` property preset to the asset ID.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>**Package**</td>
    <td>Inserts a copy of the package into the workspace.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Asset inspection

You can closely inspect an image, mesh, package, or audio file by hovering over its thumbnail in [grid view](#asset-folders) and clicking the "magnify" icon, or by right-clicking its name in [list view](#asset-folders) and selecting **Asset&nbsp;Preview**.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Asset-Inspect-Icon.png" width="400" alt="A preview view of an asset in the Asset Manager. The Insect Asset icon is highlighted." />

When previewing 3D assets like meshes, you can move the virtual camera around to get a better view from all angles. For videos, you can preview the entire video in the popup.

<Grid container spacing={3}>
<Grid item>
<video src="../../assets/studio/general/3D-Asset-Preview.mp4" controls width="315"></video>
</Grid>
<Grid item>
<table size="small">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Left mouse button&nbsp;+ drag</td>
    <td>Rotate around the object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Right mouse button&nbsp;+ drag</td>
    <td>Pan left, right, up, or down.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mouse scroll wheel</td>
    <td>Zoom in or out.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</Grid>
</Grid>

In the lower-right corner of the preview frame, the **composition** button reveals the full hierarchy of the asset including `Class.Script|Scripts`, `Class.MeshPart|MeshParts`, `Class.Animation|Animations`, and more.

<img src="../../assets/studio/general/Preview-Panel-Hierarchy.png" width="560" alt="A preview view of an asset in the Asset Manager, and the full hierarchy of the asset displays underneath the 3D representation. The Asset Composition icon is highlighted." />

## V2 Beta

<BetaAlert betaName="Revamped Asset Manager" leadIn="The revamped Asset Manager is currently in beta. Enable it through " leadOut="." components={props.components} />

### Inventory sorting

Assets are sorted by various **inventories** as selected through the collapsible menu on the left side of the window. If you don't see the sorting list, click the expand/collapse button in the lower‑left area of the window.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Inventory-Sorts.png" width="800" alt="A preview of how inventories are sorted in the left navigation of the Asset Manager." />

- **Shared With Experience** — Assets that are [shared with the open experience](../../projects/assets/privacy.md#to-experiences).
- **Places In Experience** — The experience's current [places](../../production/publishing/publish-experiences-and-places.md).
- **My Inventory** — Assets imported to your own user account, [shared with you](../../projects/assets/privacy.md#to-creators), or acquired from the [Creator Store](../../production/creator-store.md).
- **Group Inventories** — Assets imported into [groups](../../projects/groups.md) you own or groups you belong to (assuming you have sufficient [permissions](../../projects/groups.md#roles-and-permissions) within the group), or assets [shared with the groups](../../projects/assets/privacy.md#to-groups). Right‑clicking over a group reveals a context menu with the following options:

  <table size="small">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Hide Group**</td>
    <td>Hides the group from the sidebar.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Customize Groups**</td>
    <td>Allows you to choose the groups which appear in the sidebar and search filter options.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Refresh Groups**</td>
    <td>Refreshes the list of groups that you're eligible to show or hide.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

### Asset display options

In the main panel, assets for the selected [inventory](#inventory-sorting) are displayed. To toggle the view type, click on the **view&nbsp;type** button and select either **List** or **Grid**. While in grid view, asset tiles can be resized through the slider widget.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Display-Options.png" width="800" alt="Diagram of the view type button and options in the Asset Manager." />

In **List** view, click on a column header to order assets by that detail and resize columns by dragging the separator bar between them.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/List-View-Ordering.png" width="800" alt="Diagram of how columns can be ordered and resized in List view within the Asset Manager." />

<Alert severity="info">
Columns can be toggled on or off by right‑clicking in the header bar region. While columns cannot be reordered by dragging, you can toggle any column off and then toggle it back on to add it as the furthest column to the right.
</Alert>

In **Grid** view, ordering is controlled through the **sort** button:

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Grid-View-Ordering.png" width="600" alt="Location of the sort button for Grid view within the Asset Manager." />

### Asset type filters

The **filter items** button lets you control which assets are displayed.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Asset-Type-Filters.png" width="600" alt="Location of the filter button in the Asset Manager." />

<table size="small">
  <thead>
	<tr>

		<th>Options</th>
  </tr>
	</thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Asset Type**</td>
    <td>**Animation**&nbsp;| **Audio**&nbsp;| **Decal**&nbsp;| **FontFamily**&nbsp;| **Image**&nbsp;| **Mesh**&nbsp;| **MeshPart**&nbsp;| **Model**&nbsp;| **Place**&nbsp;| **Plugin**&nbsp;| **Video**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Creator**</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Source**</td>
    <td>**Creator Store**&nbsp;| **Shared With Me**&nbsp;| **Uploaded**</td>
  </tr>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>**Only&nbsp;Archived**</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Asset import

The **import** button lets you import up to 50 files in one batch. Imported assets enter the moderation queue and, upon approval, are added to the inventory of the user/group that owns the experience.

<img src="../../assets/studio/asset-manager/Import-Button.png" width="600" alt="Location of the import button in the Asset Manager." />

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mesh**</td>
    <td>You can import meshes in either `.fbx` or `.obj` format, although this workflow does not support complex meshes such as those with rigging, skinning, or animation data. For complex meshes or `.gltf` format, it's recommended that you use the [3D&nbsp;Importer](../../art/modeling/3d-importer.md).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Audio**</td>
    <td>You can import audio assets in either `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, or `.wav` format. See [Audio Assets](../../sound/assets.md#import-audio) for details.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>**Video**</td>
    <td>You can import video assets in either `.mp4` or `.mov` format if all of the [requirements](../../ui/video-frames.md) are met.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
