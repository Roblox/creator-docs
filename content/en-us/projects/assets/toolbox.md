import ToolboxFindUse from '../../includes/studio/toolbox-find-use.md'

The **Toolbox**, accessible from the [View](../../studio/view-tab.md) tab, contains a selection of [models](../../parts/models.md), [decals](../../parts/textures-decals.md), [meshes](../../parts/meshes.md), [audio](../../audio/assets.md), [plugins](../../studio/plugins.md), [videos](../../ui/video-frames.md), and fonts made by Roblox or Roblox community members. It also includes all of the creations that you've personally published or those which were published by [groups](../../projects/groups.md) you belong to.

The toolbox contains four distinct sections:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Creator Store">
<figure>
<img src="../../assets/studio/toolbox/Creator-Store-Tab.png" width="360" height="121" alt="A close up view of the Toolbox with the Creator Store tab highlighted." />

The **Creator Store** section contains models, decals, meshes, audio, plugins, videos, and fonts made by Roblox or Roblox community members. See [Creator Store](../../production/creator-store.md) for more information.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Inventory">
<figure>
<img src="../../assets/studio/toolbox/Inventory-Tab.png" width="360" height="121" alt="A close up view of the Toolbox with the Inventory tab highlighted." />

The **Inventory** section contains models, decals, meshes, audio, packages, videos, plugins, animations, and fonts that you've personally published, those which were published by [groups](../../projects/groups.md) you belong to, or those taken from the [Creator Store](../../production/creator-store.md).

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Recent">
<figure>
<img src="../../assets/studio/toolbox/Recent-Tab.png" width="360" height="121" alt="A close up view of the Toolbox with the Recent tab highlighted." />

The **Recent** tab is similar to **Inventory** except that filters your recently used models, decals, meshes, audio, videos, and animations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Creations">
<figure>
<img src="../../assets/studio/toolbox/Creations-Tab.png" width="360" height="121" alt="A close up view of the Toolbox with the Creations tab highlighted." />

The **Creations** tab is similar to **Inventory**, with the important distinction that it filters models, decals, meshes, audio, plugins, and animations that you've personally published or those which were published by [groups](../../projects/groups.md) you belong to. You can [configure](#asset-configuration) all assets in this section directly within Studio.

</Tabs>

## Find and use assets

With millions of assets available, it's helpful to narrow the search results to find exactly what you are looking for. To browse and use assets:

<ToolboxFindUse components={props.components} />

## Asset configuration

Right-clicking an asset and selecting **Edit Asset** opens the **Asset Configuration** window. In this window, you can edit the asset's details or restore it to a previous version.

<Alert severity="info">
Asset configuration is only possible for assets you've personally published or those which were published by [groups](../../projects/groups.md) you belong to. The **Creations** tab is particularly useful for filtering assets in this way.
</Alert>

## Troubleshooting

The toolbox runs through a web view. If you're experiencing any of the following issues, run the associated troubleshooting steps.
