title: Mechanical Constraints
description: Mechanical constraints behave as conceptual mechanical connections such as hinges, springs, and motors.
---

The physics engine includes the following `Class.Constraint|Constraints` that behave as conceptual mechanical connections, including hinges, springs, ropes, and more. In addition, various [mover constraints](../physics/mover-constraints.md) are available to exert directional or rotational force upon [assemblies](../physics/assemblies.md).

## Constraint Visualization

To accurately visualize constraints in Studio, you can use the following options from the [Model](../studio/model-tab.md) tab:

<img src="../assets/studio/general/Model-Tab-Constraints-Section-Labeled.png" width="754" alt="Constraints tools indicated in Model tab" />

<Grid container spacing={2} alignItems="center">

	<Grid item xs={10} sm={11} md={11} lg={11}><p>**Show Welds** &mdash; Show `Class.WeldConstraint|WeldConstraints`, separately from the visualization of other constraints.</p></Grid>
</Grid>

## Creating Constraints

All mechanical constraints must connect one or two `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or `Class.Bone|Bones`, except for [WeldConstraint](../physics/constraints/weld.md) and [NoCollisionConstraint](../physics/constraints/no-collision.md). When connected to `Class.Bone|Bones`, the constraint will use their animated position and orientation.

To create a mechanical constraint, you can use either the **Create** tool or the [Explorer](../studio/explorer.md) window.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Create Tool">

1. In the [Model](../studio/model-tab.md) tab, access the **Create** button's picker menu and select the desired constraint type, for example **Spring**.

   <img src="../assets/studio/general/Model-Tab-Constraints-Create-Menu.png" width="754" alt="Constraint picker indicated in Studio toolbar" />

1. In the 3D viewport, hover over any `Class.Part` or `Class.MeshPart` and click to add a new `Class.Attachment` to the part at the visualized point. Alternatively, hover over and click an existing `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone` to use it for the constraint.

1. Most mechanical constraints require a **secondary** attachment in their functionality, so the tool will typically prompt you to repeat the previous step on another `Class.Part`, `Class.MeshPart`, `Class.Attachment`, or `Class.Bone`.

   </figure>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Explorer">
<Alert severity="info">
Note that [WeldConstraint](../physics/constraints/weld.md) and [NoCollisionConstraint](../physics/constraints/no-collision.md) do not utilize `Class.Attachment|Attachments` or `Class.Bone|Bones`, so their linking properties in the following steps are **Part0**/**Part1**, not **Attachment0**/**Attachment1**. Similarly, you'll need to select a `Class.Part` or `Class.MeshPart` to complete the link, not an `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone`.
</Alert>

1. In the [Explorer](../studio/explorer.md) hierarchy, hover over the intended parent, click the **&CirclePlus;** button, and insert the desired constraint from the dropâ€‘down menu, such as a [SpringConstraint](../physics/constraints/spring.md).

   <img src="../assets/physics/constraints/Explorer-New-SpringConstraint.png" width="320" alt="New SpringConstraint in Explorer hierarchy" />

1. With the new constraint selected, locate its currently empty **Attachment0** property in the [Properties](../studio/properties.md) window.

   <img src="../assets/physics/constraints/Properties-SpringConstraint-Attachment0-Unassigned.png" width="320" alt="Constraint's Attachment0 property highlighted in Properties window" />

1. Link the **Attachment0** property to an `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone` in two consecutive steps:

   1. In the [Properties](../studio/properties.md) window, click in the **Attachment0** row to reveal the selection cursor.

   2. In the [Explorer](../studio/explorer.md) hierarchy, click on the target `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone`.

   <Grid item>
   <img src="../assets/physics/constraints/SpringConstraint-Link-Attachment0-2.png" width="320" alt="Target attachment indicated in Explorer hierarchy" />
   </Grid>
   </Grid>

1. Most mechanical constraints require a **secondary** `Class.Attachment` or `Class.Bone` in their functionality. If necessary, repeat the previous step on the **Attachment1** property in the [Properties](../studio/properties.md) window.

## Physical Simulation

To simulate physics while [moving](../parts/index.md#moving-parts) or [rotating](../parts/index.md#rotating-parts) parts, you can switch to **Physical** mode in
the [Model](../studio/model-tab.md) tab, effectively forcing parts to obey physical limitations. For example, if two parts are attached by a [RopeConstraint](../physics/constraints/rope.md) and you drag one part around the scene, the other part will follow as the rope becomes taut.
