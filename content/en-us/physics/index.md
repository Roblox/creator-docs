description: Overview of Roblox's rigid body physics engine, assemblies, and constraints.
---

Roblox uses a rigid body physics engine. Parts are subject to physical forces as long as they are not `Class.BasePart.Anchored|anchored`. You can create physical [assemblies](#assemblies) using attachments and constraints, and you can detect and control [collisions](#collisions) between objects using events and collision filtering.

## Assemblies

An [assembly](../physics/assemblies.md) is one or more `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` connected by rigid constraints or motors (animated rigid joints). Assemblies can be set to an initial linear or angular velocity, or their behavior can be affected through [constraints](#constraints).

## Constraints

Non-anchored assemblies react to force from gravity and collisions, but physical force can also be applied through **mechanical constraints** or **mover constraints**.

### Mechanical Constraints

Mechanical constraints include familiar objects like hinges, springs, and ropes which can be used to build mechanisms. Each is covered in [Mechanical&nbsp;Constraints](../physics/mechanical-constraints.md).

### Mover Constraints

Mover constraints apply force or torque to move one or more assemblies. Each is outlined in [Mover&nbsp;Constraints](../physics/mover-constraints.md).

## Collisions

Collision events automatically occur when two `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` touch or stop touching in the 3D world. You can [detect](../workspace/collisions.md) these collisions through the `Class.BasePart.Touched|Touched` and `Class.BasePart.TouchEnded|TouchEnded` events which occur regardless of either part's `Class.BasePart.CanCollide|CanCollide` property value.

Through [collision filtering](../workspace/collisions.md#collision-filtering) techniques such as collision groups or part‑to‑part filtering, you can control which physical assemblies collide with others.

See [Collisions](../workspace/collisions.md) for more details on detecting and filtering collisions.

## Network Ownership

In order to support complex physical mechanisms while also aiming for a smooth and responsive experience for players, the Roblox physics engine utilizes a **distributed physics** system in which computations are distributed between the server and all connected clients. Within this system, the engine assigns **network ownership** of physically simulated `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` to either a client or server to divide the work of calculating physics. See [Network Ownership](../physics/network-ownership.md) for further details.

## Adaptive Timestepping

The engine emphasizes best performance by automatically assigning assemblies to one of three simulation rates. For scenarios featuring complex mechanisms like tanks, you can improve stability by setting a fixed timestep. See [Adaptive Timestepping](../physics/adaptive-timestepping.md) for more information.

## Sleep System

When an assembly is not moving or accelerating, the Roblox physics engine improves performance by automatically stops simulating the assembly. See [Sleep System](../physics/sleep-system.md) for a detailed description of the sleep system.
