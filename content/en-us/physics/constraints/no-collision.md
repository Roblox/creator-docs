The `Class.NoCollisionConstraint` prevents collisions between two specific parts, but those parts may still register collisions with the rest of the world. Compared to [collision groups](../../workspace/collisions.md#collision-groups), it provides a direct way to disable specific collisions, such as the wheel of a car scraping against the car's body.
