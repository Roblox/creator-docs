A `Class.UniversalConstraint` ensures two axes on two assemblies remain perpendicular. Example applications include vehicle power transmission to the rear drive shafts, robotics, and more.

## Orientations

Orientation of a universal's two attachments affects how it will move. To ensure it behaves correctly, the `Class.Attachment.SecondaryAxis|SecondaryAxis` of the attachments, visualized by the orange arrows, should be **perpendicular** to each other. Note that a green L-shaped indicator appears when the axes are properly oriented.

## Limits

Enabling the `Class.UniversalConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property exposes the `Class.UniversalConstraint.MaxAngle|MaxAngle` limit to restrict tilt within a cone, as well as `Class.UniversalConstraint.Restitution|Restitution` which defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach the limit.
