</Alert>

A `Class.RodConstraint` keeps two attachments separated by its defined `Class.RodConstraint.Length|Length`. By default, both attachments can rotate freely, although you can enable limits to restrict rotational tilt.

## Limits

You can limit rotation of the attachments within a cone, independently of each other, by enabling the `Class.RodConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property and setting `Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle0|LimitAngle0` and `Class.RodConstraint.LimitAngle1|LimitAngle1` respectively.
