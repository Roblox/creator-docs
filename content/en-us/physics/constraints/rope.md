description: RopeConstraint prevents two attachments from separating further than a defined length, with optional behavior as an extending or contracting winch.

<Alert severity="info">
For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mechanical constraints, including `Class.RopeConstraint`, see [Mechanical Constraints](../../physics/mechanical-constraints.md). Also see [Roblox&nbsp;Units](../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.
</Alert>

A `Class.RopeConstraint` prevents two attachments from separating further than a defined `Class.RopeConstraint.Length|Length`. The attachments can move closer together than this length and both can freely rotate. `Class.RopeConstraint.Restitution|Restitution` defines the elasticity of the attachments when they reach the separation limit specified by `Class.RopeConstraint.Length|Length`.

This constraint can also be powered to behave as a [motorized winch](#winch).

## Winch

If a rope's `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchEnabled|WinchEnabled` property is enabled, it attempts to translate the attachments to a set separation specified by `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget`, effectively the target length of the rope in studs. This translation is controlled by `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed`, `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchResponsiveness|WinchResponsiveness`, and `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchForce|WinchForce`.

<Alert severity="info">
`Class.RopeConstraint.WinchSpeed|WinchSpeed` must be a **positive** value, used to either contract or extend the rope length to `Class.RopeConstraint.WinchTarget|WinchTarget`. Setting a negative speed will revert to&nbsp;0, not reverse the winch servo direction.
