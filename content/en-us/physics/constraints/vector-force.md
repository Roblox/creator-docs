<Alert severity="info">
For an overview on creating, visualizing, and simulating mover constraints, including `Class.VectorForce`, see [Mover Constraints](../../physics/mover-constraints.md). Also see [Roblox&nbsp;Units](../../physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units compare to metric units.
</Alert>

The `Class.VectorForce` constraint applies constant linear force on an assembly. The direction and strength of the force is determined by a `Datatype.Vector3` and can be relative to an attachment on the part, another attachment, or the world coordinate system.

<Alert severity="warning">
Because the `Class.VectorForce` constraint applies **constant** force and acceleration, very high speeds may result if no other forces are involved. If you want to maintain a more steady velocity over time, use a [LinearVelocity](../../physics/constraints/linear-velocity.md) constraint. Alternatively, if you only need **initial** velocity, set the `Class.BasePart.AssemblyLinearVelocity|AssemblyLinearVelocity` property directly on the assembly.
</Alert>

## Force Location

By default, force is applied to the assembly at the location of `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. Thus, if its center of mass is not aligned with the direction/point of force, torque will be applied as well. If desired, force can be focused at the center of mass by toggling on `Class.VectorForce.ApplyAtCenterOfMass|ApplyAtCenterOfMass`.

## Relativity

By default, force is applied relative to `Class.Constraint.Attachment0|Attachment0`. If the parent assembly rotates, the force will change direction to match the adjusted orientation of the attachment; visualize this behavior in how the thruster of a rocket pushes it forward, regardless of the rocket's rotation.

If `Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to **World**, force will be applied in world coordinates, independent of the parent or attachment orientations; visualize this behavior as a directional force like the wind blowing against an object.

If `Class.VectorForce.RelativeTo|RelativeTo` is set to **Attachment1**, force will be applied relative to `Class.Constraint.Attachment1|Attachment1` and, if the attachment rotates, the force will change to match its orientation.
