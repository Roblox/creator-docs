A `Class.BallSocketConstraint` forces its two attachments into the same position and allows them to freely rotate about all three axes. However, you can enable limits to restrict both tilt and twist.

## Limits

You can set limits to restrict both **tilt** and **twist** of a ball socket, similar to how a human's head can tilt and turn within a limited axial range. Enabling the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` property exposes the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.UpperAngle|UpperAngle` value to restrict **tilt** within a cone; it also exposes the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistLimitsEnabled|TwistLimitsEnabled` property which, when enabled, lets you restrict **twist** rotation through the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistLowerAngle|TwistLowerAngle` and `Class.BallSocketConstraint.TwistUpperAngle|TwistUpperAngle` limits.

</GridContainer>

Enabling `Class.BallSocketConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` also exposes the `Class.BallSocketConstraint.Restitution|Restitution` value which defines the elasticity of the attachments at their tilt and/or twist limits.

<Alert severity="info">
When `Class.BallSocketConstraint.LimitsEnabled|LimitsEnabled` is enabled, orientation of a ball socket's attachments affects how it rotates. To ensure rotation occurs around the desired axis, each attachment's `Class.Attachment.Axis|Axis`, visualized by the yellow arrow, should point in the same direction.
