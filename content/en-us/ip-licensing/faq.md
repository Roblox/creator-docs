  <dt>**What are the main types of IP?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    There are four main types of IP:

    - Copyright: Protects original works of authorship like stories, music, art, movies, TV shows, etc.
    - Trademark: Protects something that functions as a unique badge for a company's products or services, like words or names ("Nike", "Coca-Cola"), logos, slogans, and even certain sounds.
    - Patent: Protects new inventions like new machines, new processes, and new designs for manufactured items.
    - Trade secret: Protects information that a company keeps secret because it gives them a business advantage, like formulas and manufacturing processes.

  <dt>**What information is shared with IP owners if I apply for a license?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    Only publicly available information about the experience you’re applying with is visible to the IP holder before they accept your request.

    If you enter an agreement with an IP holder, they receive metrics on the licensed experience including the number of visits, average of active users over a 7-day period (7DAU), and an anonymized list of transactions if a revenue share rate is set in the license’s terms.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**What do I do if I’m currently using a popular IP that isn't available in the Licenses catalog?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    If you want to use an IP in your experience, you must have explicit permission from the IP holder. We recommend removing any content that might use IP and isn’t covered by a license. There might be some creators and experiences that have reached agreements with IP holders on their own; if you already have a licensing agreement with the IP holder, then that is still valid.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**Can I apply for a license with a game that doesn’t currently meet the eligibility requirements?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    Yes. When you apply for a license, the experience you pick is meant to showcase to IP holders your abilities as a creator. This experience can be partially or fully finished, or it can be a fork of an existing game. After you apply to use a license, the IP holder can review your application to build your experience around their IP and then choose to grant you a license.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**How much creative freedom do I have with the IP?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    Each license comes with a set of content standards for how an IP can and can’t be used, and each license’s standards are different depending on the needs of the IP holder. As long as you operate within the bounds of the Roblox Terms of Use, and the license and its standards, you have creative control on how to use IP in your experience.
    
    An IP holder can request changes through Roblox if you're deviating from those standards, and can request to terminate a license if you consistently do not follow those standards.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**Do I have to use a template or approved assets in order to use an IP?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    No. As long as you’re following the terms and content standards of the license, you can make or use your own assets.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**Can I create one level or a portion of my game based on an IP and request a license?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    No. You can only request or be offered a license for a full experience, where the IP is central to and present throughout the experience.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**How do I communicate with IP holders I have an agreement with?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    IP holders can ask Roblox to contact you if they want to request any changes to a licensed experience. You'll receive a notification from Roblox to ensure that you can make any necessary changes to your experience. 
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**How will I be notified if a license changes?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    Any time the status of a license is changed, when your request for a license is approved or denied, or if the license is removed from an experience, you’ll be notified on Creator Hub. You can also always check your active licenses in your License Manager.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**How are disputes resolved?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    IP Holders can attempt to license an experience twice, and creators can dispute an offer for a license twice. If an agreement can’t be reached and the IP owner still believes that the experience contains their IP, they can pursue other options, such as filing a DMCA claim.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**How does IP licensing interact with the DMCA process?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    IP licensing provides IP holders and creators with an alternative to DMCA takedowns. The current DMCA process will continue as required by law, but we want to make it easier for IP owners and creators to form partnerships and create more opportunities.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**What protections do I have as a creator from an IP owner who is trying to inaccurately claim IP in my experience?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    If you believe an IP owner has inaccurately offered a license for your experience, you have 7 days to dispute the offer. When you dispute an offer, you can select from a set of reasons that tell the IP owner why the license isn't needed.
  <p /></dd><br />

  <dt>**Can an IP license agreement ever be cancelled?**</dt>
  <dd><p />
    An IP holder can choose to cancel a license for a small set of reasons, like if a creator consistently doesn’t follow their content standards or if they somehow lose the rights to the IP. In this case, you'll receive at least 30 days advance notice before the termination of the license.

    During that time, you should work to remove the IP from your experience or take down the experience entirely. Following the notice period, the terms and any revenue share will immediately be removed from the experience.
