**IP licensing tools** allow IP holders to manage their intellectual property (IP) on Roblox and help creators partner with popular IPs on the platform. With the Licenses catalog, creators can browse available IPs and apply to use them in their experiences.

## License Manager

As an IP holder, you can use Roblox's IP licensing tools to partner with creators and reach new audiences on the platform. The **License Manager** allows you to define licenses, specify content standards and revenue share requirements, and set eligibility criteria that experiences must meet in order to use your IP.

<Alert severity="warning">
  The License Manager for IP holders is currently only available to a select number of eligible IP holders. This feature will open up to more IP holders in the future.

## Rights Manager

The **Rights Manager** allows rights holders to report unauthorized use of copyright content on Roblox. With this tool, you can request the removal of unauthorized experiences, avatar items, and assets hosted on the platform.

For more information about using the Rights Manager, see [Rights Manager](../production/publishing/rights-manager.md).

## IP licensing for creators

Creating experiences using popular IP can make your content more recognizable to users and help you reach new audiences that already know and love certain characters, settings, and storylines.

As a creator, you can either receive offers directly from IP holders or browse the [Licenses catalog](https://create.roblox.com/explore/licenses) and apply to use an available IP in your experience. A license allows you to create a full experience based on an IP while following the terms and revenue share outlined by the IP holder.

For more information about using IP licensing as a creator, see [IP licensing for creators](./creators.md).
