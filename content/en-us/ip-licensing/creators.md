title: IP licensing for creators
description: How to use IP licensing as a creator.
---

Creating experiences using popular IP can make your content more recognizable to users and help you reach new audiences that already know and love certain characters, settings, and storylines.

As a creator, you can either receive offers directly from IP holders or browse the Licenses catalog and apply to use an available IP in your experience.

## Explore licenses

To explore available licenses in the Licenses catalog:

1. In the **Explore** dropdown in the Creator Hub, click **Licenses**.
2. Click an available IP license to see the details page for that specific license.

3. Click **View details** to see more details about the license, like eligibility requirements and content standards.

## Apply to use a license

<Alert severity="info">
  Before applying to use an IP license, make sure your experience is public.
</Alert>

To apply to use an IP license in your experience:

1. In the **Explore** dropdown in the Creator Hub, click **Licenses**.
2. Select an IP from the available licenses.
3. Click **Request license**.
4. Select the experience you want to apply to the license with and click **Next**.
5. Under **Intent**, enter more details about your experience in the form of a pitch. This can help the IP holder make a decision about your application. For more information about writing a pitch, see [Pitch details](#pitch-details).
6. Under **Experience readiness**, select one of the following:
   - **Yes, my experience is ready to use this intellectual property** if you're done incorporating the IP into your experience. Revenue share will start as soon as the license agreement becomes active.
   - **No, I need time to incorporate this intellectual property into my experience** if you're not done incorporating the IP into your experience. Revenue share won't start immediately, but the IP holder can still turn on monetization at any time.
7. Download the content standards file, review and agree to the content standards, and click **Next**.
8. Click **Request** to submit your application. The IP holder then reviews and either approves or rejects your application.

<Alert severity="info">
  You can currently only request or be offered a license for a full experience, where the IP is central to and present throughout the experience.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
  After you enter an IP license agreement, you **cannot** cancel it.
</Alert>

### Pitch details

Including a well-written pitch with your request can make the IP holder more likely to approve your application. Your pitch should convey a compelling idea and show that you are confident in your ability to execute this creative vision.

We recommend that you include the following information in your pitch:

- **Overall vision**:

  - What makes your adaption of the IP unique and exciting for players.
  - Your team's relevant experience, including examples of previous games you have developed, along with any previous work involving IP.
  - How you believe the IP integration will engage players, expand the IP's reach, and create new opportunities for monetization and community growth.

- **Creative elements**:

  - How your experience's visual and audio design will reflect the IP, including character models, environments, UI, and soundscapes. For example, if you're applying to integrate an IP like the Blair Witch, you can highlight the use of atmospheric visuals and sound effects that evoke suspense and dread.
  - How the story, lore, or signature moments from the IP will be integrated into your experience. This could involve recreating iconic scenes, referencing key plot points, or introducing original storylines that fit within the universe of the IP.
  - How you will maintain the integrity of the IP, making sure all creative choices align with the IP's established tone, themes, and content standards.

- **Gameplay**:

  - How the main gameplay loops will leverage the IP's unique features. For example, a survival horror IP could include mechanics like stealth, resource management, or cooperative puzzle-solving.
  - How players will interact with the IP. You can describe progression systems, challenges, and rewards that are consistent with the theme of the IP.
  - How your experience genre aligns with the IP. For example, an IP like The Strangers might be more aligned with PvE escape games or social deduction horror, while an IP like Fall might be more aligned with high-stakes obbys or survival challenges.

- **Timeline**:

  - What the current state of your experience is and when you expect the IP to be fully integrated into your experience.

Your pitch should **not** include foul or harmful language, negotiation intent, request for financial information, or request to connect with the IP holder outside of Roblox.

## View license agreements

To view all of your offers and license agreements, go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **Licenses**. You can filter all license agreements by:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>**Filter**</th>
    <th>**Description**</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>**Offers**</td>
    <td>All license offers that IP holders have sent you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**My Requests**</td>
    <td>All license applications that you have sent to IP holders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Active**</td>
    <td>All active license agreements between you and IP holders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Inactive**</td>
    <td>All archived offers or license agreements between you and IP holders.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Review a license offer

<Alert severity="error">
  Any license offer you receive from an IP holder automatically becomes active after 7 days. **You must dispute the offer to reject it.**
</Alert>

IP holders can reach out and make a license offer directly to your experience. This can happen if Roblox detects that your experience has a high likelihood of making prominent use of a registered IP.

After you receive an offer, you can review the offer details and either:

- Do nothing and wait for the offer to be automatically accepted after 7 days.
- [Dispute the offer](#dispute-the-offer).

### Dispute the offer

To dispute a license offer:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **Licenses**.
2. Select the license offer you want to dispute.
3. Under **Actions you can take**, click **dispute this license**.
4. In the dispute modal, select one of the following reasons for the dispute:
   - **My creation does not use this IP** if you believe that the IP holder made the license offer by mistake.
   - **My use of this IP is licensed or otherwise authorized by law** if you believe that you already have the rights to use the IP.
   - **I modified my creation to remove the IP** if you have fully removed the IP from your experience.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Review and accept the legal agreements.
7. Click **Dispute**. The IP holder can then accept or reject your offer dispute.

If the IP holder accepts your dispute, you will not enter into an agreement with them. However, if the IP holder rejects your dispute, you will receive their license offer again. After you receive their offer a second time, you can either wait 7 days for the offer to automatically become active or dispute the offer one final time.

If you submit a second and final dispute, you will not enter into an agreement with the IP holder. Instead, the offer will be archived, and the IP holder might choose to pursue a [DMCA claim](../production/publishing/dmca-guidelines.md) separately.

## Transactions

When you enter an agreement with an IP holder, you agree to the revenue share rate they have set for their IP license. For example, if the revenue share rate of the IP license is set to **10%** and one of the following items sells for **100 Robux** inside your experience:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">**Game passes**</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td width="55%">**60%** (in this case, 60 Robux) from the sale revenue goes to the item owner.</td>
    <td width="45%">From the 60 Robux:<br /><br /><ul><li>The license owner receives **6 Robux** (10% of the 60 Robux that would have otherwise gone to the item owner in an unlicensed experience).</li><li>The item owner receives the rest, or **54 Robux** (the other 90% of the sale revenue).</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**10%** (in this case, 10 Robux) from the sale revenue goes to affiliate fees. For example, if the game pass is owned by User A but it's on sale inside User B's experience, each under a different license.</td>
    <td>From the 10 Robux:<br /><br /><ul><li>The license owner receives **1 Robux** (10%).</li><li>The item owner (User A) receives the rest, or **9 Robux** (90%).</li></ul></td>

    <td colspan="2">**30%** (in this case, 30 Robux) from the sale revenue goes to Roblox fees.</td>
