description: How to use IP licensing as an IP holder.
---

<Alert severity="warning">
  The License Manager is currently only available to a small number of eligible IP holders.
</Alert>

Use IP licensing tools to reach new audiences on Roblox as you partner with creators to use your IP in their experiences. The **License Manager** allows you to define licenses, specify content standards and revenue share requirements, and set eligibility criteria that experiences must meet in order to use your IP.

To use the IP licensing feature:

1. [Register your IP holder account.](#register-your-account)
2. [Create an IP family so that Roblox can detect experiences that already use your IP.](#create-an-ip-family)
3. [Create a license listing and determine the terms and conditions creators must meet to apply to and use your IP.](#create-a-license-listing)
4. [Review experiences that match your IP and send them offers to work together.](#review-matches-and-send-a-license-offer)

## Register your account

Before managing your IP licenses, you must first register your account either as an IP holder or as their authorized representative. This allows Roblox to confirm your legal identity with the creations that you own or represent. You only need to register once.

To register as an IP holder or as an authorized representative:

1. In the Creator Hub, go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **Registration**.
2. Click **Start registration**.
3. Fill out the registration form.
    1. Under **Rights holder**:
        1. In the dropdown, select one of:
            - **I am the rights holder** if you're registering on behalf of yourself.
            - **I am reporting on behalf of my organization or client** if you're an authorized representative registering on behalf of someone else.
        2. Enter your full name.
        3. If you're an authorized representative, enter your organization or client name.
    2. Under **Address**, enter your address.
    3. If you're an authorized representative, under **Supporting documentation**, upload documents that prove you're an authorized representative of the IP holder. You can upload a maximum of 3 files. See [Supporting documentation](#supporting-documentation) for more information.
    4. Under **Legal agreements**, confirm that all of your information in the registration form is accurate, and agree to the [Terms of Use](https://www.roblox.com/info/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.roblox.com/info/privacy).
    5. Under **Signature**, enter your full legal name as your electronic signature.
4. Click **Submit for review**.

Registering your account also gives you access to the Rights Manager, which you can use to issue claims and DMCA requests. For more information about using the Rights Manager, see [Rights Manager](../production/publishing/rights-manager.md).

### Supporting documentation

If you're registering as the authorized representative of an IP holder, you must upload supporting documentation in the form of a **letter of authorization**. This letter must:

- Be on official company letterhead.
- Identify you as the individual authorized representative.
- Identify the company you work for.
- State whether you are authorized to act on the IP holder's entire IP portfolio or only on specific IP titles.
- State whether you can enforce the IP rights (for example, issue removal requests), enter into license agreements pertaining to the IP rights, or both.
- Be signed and dated. Digital signatures are allowed.

## Create an IP family

An **IP family** is a folder that contains keywords that represents a particular IP. The keywords you add to your IP family are used by Roblox's scanning and search features to detect experiences across the platform that might match your IP.

To create an IP family:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **IP Library**.
2. Click **Create IP family**.
3. Fill out the IP family form.
    1. Under **Details**, enter a name for your IP.
    2. Under **Primary keyword**, enter the word or phrase that is the official name of your IP. This keyword is usually the primary name of your copyrighted work, and is used to find potential experience matches across Roblox. You can only have one primary keyword per language.
        - You can click **Add translation** to add different translations of your IP name by country. Adding primary keyword translations is important if your IP is registered under different names in different countries.
    3. Under **Secondary keywords**, enter a list of words or phrases that represent characters, fanciful places, or fictitious branded elements related to your IP. Secondary keywords are combined with your primary keyword to find potential matches.
        - You can click **Add translation** to add different translations of your secondary keywords by country.
    4. Under **Supporting documents**, upload documentation to prove that you are the rightful owner of the primary and secondary keywords you entered. For example, **?????**.
4. Click **Submit for review**.

After you submit an IP family for approval, Roblox reviews your submission and either approves or rejects it. If your submission is rejected, you can go to **IP Library** ⟩ **[IP family name]** and click **Rejection reason** for more details. Usually, Roblox will ask for additional legal documentation, such as copyright or trademark registrations, to validate the ownership of elements in your IP library.

You can also add more keywords to your IP family at any time by going to **IP Library** ⟩ **[IP family name]** and clicking **Add IP media**.

## Create a license listing

After you create and set up your IP family, you can create a **license listing** to help promote your IP to creators and to encourage them to apply to use it.

License listings consist of:

- A listing that represents your IP family to creators, and allows them to apply to use your IP in their experiences through the [Licenses catalog](./creators.md#explore-licenses). A listing can have one or more licenses under it.
- One or more licenses that represent the set of terms and conditions that define how creators can use your IP to build those experiences.

To create your license listing:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **License Manager** ⟩ **Licenses**.
2. Select the **My Licenses** tab.
3. Click **Create license listing**.
4. In the **Create listing** step, set up the listing.
    1. Under **IP family**, select an IP family that you have previously created.
    2. Under **Listing details**, enter a title and a description for the listing.
    3. Under **Thumbnails**, enter up to 5 images that relate to the listing. The first image you upload is shown to creators on the listing tile of the Licenses page. Make sure these images have an aspect ratio of 16:9, and are in PNG or JPG formats.
    4. Click **Next**.

    <img src="../assets/ip-licensing/CreateListing.png" alt="Screenshot of IP listing creation screen." width="550" />

5. In the **Add license** step, configure a license to add to your listing. To skip this step and add a license to your listing later, click **Skip license**.
    1. Under **License details**, enter a title and a description. If you make your license public, the title and description become public-facing and are visible to creators.
    2. Under **Monetization**:
        1. Set a  **revenue share rate** between 0% and 95%. This is the revenue percentage you want to receive from experiences using your IP, and is shown to creators when they apply to use your IP through a license listing.
        2. Select one of the following for the **default revenue share timing**:
            - **Monetize on activation**, which means the revenue share is applied the moment the agreement between the IP holder and the creator of the experience becomes active. Historical transactions are **not** subject to this revenue share.
            - **Monetize later**, which allows you to turn on revenue share at a later date of your choosing.
    3. Under **Experience eligibility**, select the criteria you want experiences to meet in order to apply to use the license. Creators whose experiences don't meet these requirements aren't eligible to apply to use your IP. To allow all creators to apply, leave the default values.
        - For **Minimum average last 7 daily active users (DAU)**, choose between no requirement, greater than 1,000 DAU, or grater than 25,000 DAU.
        - For **Maximum maturity rating**, choose between minimal, mild, moderate, and restricted. See [Maturity labels](../production/promotion/content-maturity.md#questionnaire-categories) for more information about different maturity ratings.
    4. Under **Guidelines and restrictions**, upload a file with all guidelines and restrictions you want creators to follow when using your IP to build experiences. This file must describe what creators are and aren't allowed to do with your IP.
    5. Under **Privacy**, select one of the following:
        - **Public** to make the license listing public and visible to all creators. This option also allows all eligible creators to apply to use the license.
        - **Private** to make the license only available to creators that you reach out to directly and that have experiences that match your IP.
    6. Click **Next**.

    <img src="../assets/ip-licensing/CreateLicense.png" alt="Screenshot of IP license creation screen." width="550" />

6. Review the details of the license listing and click **Create**.

After you create a license listing, you can go to **My licenses** ⟩ **[IP license listing]** to make changes to both the listing and its associated licenses:

- To edit details of the listing, like its IP family and thumbnails, click **Edit listing**.
- To edit details of a specific license, click the edit icon next to that license. You can edit any field except for the revenue share rate.
- To add new licenses to the listing, click **Add license**.

<Alert severity="warning">
  You **can't** change the revenue share rate you set after you create a license listing.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="info">
  Items purchased outside of the experience on the Marketplace are not subject to the revenue share rate.
</Alert>

## Review matches and send a license offer

Matches are experiences that use a significant amount of content related to your IP library. Roblox uses the primary and secondary keywords added to your IP family to find experiences that include content that matches your IP.

You can review the experiences matched to your IP and send them a license offer in order to enter an agreement with an experience's creator, earn a share of their revenue, and set guidelines for the creator to follow.

To review your matches and send a license offer:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **License Manager** ⟩ **Matches**.
2. Select the experience you want to send an offer to.
3. In the **New license offer** panel:
    1. Select an IP family and a license.
    2. Select the revenue share timing. You can choose to **Monetize on activation** and apply the revenue share rate of the license you selected the moment the creator accepts your offer, or **Monetize later** and activate the revenue share rate later.
    3. Click **Send offer**.

<Alert severity="warning">
  You can only send offers to experiences that are not already associated with an active license agreement.
</Alert>

## View license agreements

To view all of your offers and license agreements:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **License Manager** ⟩ **Licenses**.
2. Select the **My License Agreements** tab. You can filter all license agreements by:

## Review an offer dispute from a creator

After you send a license offer to a creator, they can choose to dispute that offer. If a creator disputes your offer, you can either accept the dispute and archive the offer you sent, or reject the dispute and send the offer to the creator again.

To review an offer dispute from a creator:

1. Go to **Intellectual Property** ⟩ **License Manager** ⟩ **Licenses**.
2. Select the creation that has disputed your offer. The reason for the creator's dispute displays at the top of the page.
3. Accept or reject the dispute.
    - To accept the dispute and archive the offer, click **Accept dispute**.
    - To reject the dispute and send the license offer to the creator again, click **Reject dispute**.

If the creator disputes the offer again, the offer is automatically archived and the agreement does not take place.
