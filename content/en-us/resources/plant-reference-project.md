title: Plant Reference Project
description: A deep dive into building of the Plant experience, a game where players plant seeds and harvest plants.

[Plant][planturl] is a reference experience where players plant and water seeds, so they
can later harvest and sell the resulting plants.

The project focuses on common use cases that you might encounter when developing
an experience on Roblox. Where applicable, you'll find notes on tradeoffs,
compromises, and the rationale of various implementation choices, so you can
make the best decision for your own experiences.

## Get the File

1. Navigate to the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14353060924/Plant" target="_blank">Plant</a> experience page.
1. Click the **&ctdot;** button and **Edit in Studio**.

## Use Cases

[Plant][planturl] covers the following use cases:

- Session data and player data persistence
- UI view management
- Client-server networking
- First Time User Experience (FTUE)
- Hard and soft currency purchases

In addition, this project solves narrower sets of problems that are
applicable to many experiences, including:

- Customization of an area in the place that's associated with a player
- Managing the player character's movement speed
- Creating an object that follows characters around
- Detecting what part of the world a character is in

Note that there are several use cases in this experience that are too small, too
niche, or don't demonstrate a solution to an interesting design challenge; these
are not covered.

## Project Structure

The first decision when creating an experience is deciding how to structure the
[project](../projects/), which mainly includes where to place specific instances
in the [data model](../projects/data-model.md) and how to organize and structure
entry points for both client and server code.

### Data Model

The following table describes which container services in the data model instances are placed in.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Service</th>
    <th>Types of Instances</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>`Class.Workspace`</td>
		<td>
			<p>Contains static models representing the 3D world, specifically parts of the world that don't belong to any player. You don't need to dynamically create, modify, or destroy these instances at runtime, so it's acceptable to leave them here.</p>
			<p>There is also an empty `Class.Folder`, to which players' farm models will be added at runtime.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>`Class.Lighting`</td>
    <td>
			<p>Atmospheric and lighting effects.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>`Class.ReplicatedFirst`</td>
    <td>
      <p>Contains the smallest possible subset of instances needed to display the loading screen and initialize the game. The more instances that are placed in `Class.ReplicatedFirst`, the longer the wait for them to replicate before code in `Class.ReplicatedFirst` can run.</p>
			- In the **Instances** folder exists the loading screen GUI.
			- In the **Source** folder exists the loading screen code and the code needed to wait for the rest of the game to load. The `start` `Class.LocalScript` is the entry point for all client-side code in the project.
  	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Class.ReplicatedStorage`</td>
    <td>
      <p>Serves as a storage container for all instances for which access is required on both the client and the server.</p>
			- In the **Dependencies** folder exists some third party libraries used by the project.
			- In the **Instances** folder exists a wide range of prefabricated instances used by various classes in the game.
			- In the **Source** folder exists all code **not** required for the loading process that needs to be accessible from both the client and the server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Class.ServerScriptService`</td>
    <td>
      <p>Contains a `Class.Script` serving as the entry point for all server-side code in the project.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Class.ServerStorage`</td>
    <td>
      <p>Serves as a storage container for all instances that do not need to be replicated to the client.</p>
			- In the **Instances** folder exists a template **Farm** model. A copy of this is placed in `Class.Workspace` when the player joins the game, where it will be replicated to all players.
			- In the **Source** folder exists all code that is exclusive to the server.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`Class.SoundService`</td>
    <td>
      <p>Contains the `Class.Sound` objects used for sound effects in the game. Under `Class.SoundService`, these `Class.Sound` objects have no position and are not simulated in 3D space.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Entry Points

Most projects organize code inside reusable `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts`
that can be imported across the entire codebase.
`Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` are reusable but they do not execute
on their own; they need to be imported by a `Class.Script` or `Class.LocalScript`. Many Roblox
projects will have a large number of `Class.Script` and `Class.LocalScript` objects, each
pertaining to a behavior or particular system in the game, creating multiple
points of entry.

For the [Plant][planturl] microgame, a different approach is implemented through
a single `Class.LocalScript` that is the entry point for all client code, and a
single `Class.Script` that is the entry point for all server code. The correct
approach for your project depends on your requirements, but a single point of
entry provides greater control over the order in which systems are executed in.

The following lists describe the tradeoffs of both approaches:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Single Entry Point">
- A single `Class.Script` and a single `Class.LocalScript` cover server and client code respectively.
- Greater control over the order in which different systems are started because all code is initialized from a single script.
- Can pass objects by reference between systems.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Multiple Entry Points">
- New `Class.Script` or `Class.LocalScript` objects are created as needed.
- Greater ability to isolate code.
- Can take advantage of `Class.Actor|Actors` and [Multi-Threading](../scripting/multithreading.md).
- Execution is in a non-deterministic order.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### High Level Systems Architecture

The top-level systems in the project are detailed below. Some of these systems
are substantially more complex than others, and in many cases their
functionality is abstracted across a hierarchy of other classes.

<img src="../assets/resources/plant/Architecture-Systems.png" width="75%" alt="Plant project systems architecture diagram" />

Each of these systems is a "singleton," in that it's a non-instantiable class
that is instead initialized by the relevant client or server `start` script. You
can read more about the [singleton pattern](#singletons) later in this guide.

</table>

<Alert severity="info">
One notable callout for the singleton pattern is the **Network**
`Class.ModuleScript` which includes logic that runs on both the client and the
server, initialized through separate `startServer()` and `startClientAsync()`
methods. This is a pattern that you should generally avoid, as it exposes
server-side logic unnecessarily to the client and can make files more complex
than needed. In this case, however, a unified `Class.ModuleScript` setup
presents a more streamlined interface for what is a high touch part of the
codebase.
</Alert>

## Client-Server Communication

Most Roblox experiences involve some element of communication between the client
and server. This can include the client requesting the server perform a certain
action and the server replicating updates to the client.

In this project, client-server communication is kept as generic as possible by
limiting the use of `Class.RemoteEvent` and `Class.RemoteFunction` objects in
order to decrease the amount of special rules to keep track of. This project
uses the following methods, in order of preference:

- Replication via the [player data system](#replication-via-player-data-system).
- Replication via [attributes](#replication-via-attributes).
- Replication via [tags](#replication-via-tags).
- Messaging [directly](#messaging-directly-via-network-module) via the **Network** module.

### Replication via Player Data System

The **player data system** allows data to be associated with the player which
persists between save sessions. This system provides replication from client to
server and a set of APIs that can be used to query data and subscribe to
changes, making it ideal for replicating changes to player state from the server
to the client.

For example, rather than firing a bespoke `UpdateCoins` `Class.RemoteEvent` to
tell the client how many coins it has, you can call the following and let the
client subscribe to it via the `PlayerDataClient.updated` event.

```lua
PlayerDataServer:setValue(player, "coins", 5)
```

Of course, this is only useful for server-to-client replication and for values that you want to persist between sessions, but this applies to a surprising number of cases in the project, including:

- The current FTUE stage
- The player's inventory
- The amount of coins the player has
- The state of the player's farm

### Replication via Attributes

In situations where the server needs to replicate a custom value to the client
that's specific to a given `Class.Instance`, you can use
[attributes](../studio/instance-attributes.md). Roblox automatically replicates
attribute values, so you don't need to maintain any code paths to replicate
state associated with an object. Another advantage is that this replication
happens alongside the instance itself.

This is particularly useful for instances created at runtime, as attributes set
on a new instance before it is parented to the data model will replicate
atomically with the instance itself. This circumvents any need to write code to
"wait" for extra data to be replicated via a `Class.RemoteEvent` or
`Class.StringValue`.

You can also directly read attributes from the data model, from either the
client or the server, with the `Class.Instance:GetAttribute()|GetAttribute()`
method, and subscribe to changes with the
`Class.Instance:GetAttributeChangedSignal()|GetAttributeChangedSignal()` method.
In the [Plant][planturl] project, this approach is used for, amongst other
things, replicating the current status of plants to clients.

### Replication via Tags

`Class.CollectionService` lets you apply a string tag to an `Class.Instance`.
This is useful for categorizing instances and replicating that categorization to
the client.

For example, the `CanPlant` tag is applied on the server to signify to the client that a given pot is able to receive a plant.

### Messaging Directly via Network Module

For situations where none of the previous options apply, you can use custom network calls through the **Network** module. This is the only option in the project that allows client-to-server communication and is therefore most useful for transmitting client requests and receiving a server response.

[Plant][planturl] uses direct network calls for a variety of client requests, including:

- Watering a plant
- Planting a seed
- Purchasing an item

The drawback with this approach is that each individual message requires some
bespoke configuration which can increase the complexity of the project, although
this has been avoided wherever possible, particularly for server-to-client
communication.

## Classes and Singletons

Classes in the [Plant][planturl] project, like instances on Roblox, can be
created and destroyed. Its class syntax is inspired by the idiomatic Lua
approach to [object-oriented programming](https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html)
with a number of changes to enable [strict typechecking](#strict-type-inference) support.

### Instantiation

Many classes in the project are associated with one or more
`Class.Instance|Instances`. Objects of a given class are created using a `new()`
method, consistent with how instances are created in Roblox using
`Datatype.Instance.new()`.

This pattern is generally used for objects where the
class has a physical representation in the data model, and the class extends its
functionality. A good example is `BeamBetween` which creates a `Class.Beam`
object between two given `Class.Attachment` objects and keeps those attachments
orientated so that the beam is always facing upwards. These instances could be cloned from a prefabricated version in `Class.ReplicatedStorage` or passed into `new()` as an argument and stored inside the object under `self`.

### Corresponding Instances

As noted above, many classes in this project have a data model representation, an instance that corresponds with the class and is manipulated by it.

Rather than creating these instances when a class object is instantiated, the code generally opts to `Class.Instance:Clone()|Clone()` a prefabricated version of the `Class.Instance` stored under `Class.ReplicatedStorage` or `Class.ServerStorage`. Although it would be possible to serialize the properties of these instances and create them from scratch in the class' `new()` functions, doing so would make editing the objects very cumbersome and make them harder for a reader to parse. Additionally, cloning an instance is generally a faster operation than creating a new instance and customizing its properties at runtime.

### Composition

Although inheritance is possible in Lua using
[metatables](../luau/metatables.md), the project opts to instead allow classes
to extend each other through **composition**. When combining classes through
composition, the "child" object is instantiated in the `new()` method of the
class and is included as a member under `self`.

For an example of this in action, see the `CloseButton` class which wraps the `Button` class.

### Cleanup

Similar to how an `Class.Instance` can be destroyed with the
`Class.Instance:Destroy()|Destroy()` method, classes which can be instantiated
can also be destroyed. The destructor method for project classes is `destroy()`
with a lowercase `d` for `camelCase` consistency across the codebase's methods,
as well as to distinguish between the project's classes and Roblox instances.

The role of the `destroy()` method is to destroy any instances created by the
object, disconnect any connections, and call `destroy()` on any child objects.
This is particularly important for connections because instances with active
connections are not cleaned up by the Lua garbage collector, even if no
references to the instance or connections to the instance remain.

### Singletons

Singletons, as the name suggests, are classes for which only one object can ever
exist. They are the project's equivalent of Roblox's [Services](../scripting/services.md). Rather than storing a reference to the singleton object and passing it around in the Lua code, [Plant][planturl] takes
advantage of the fact that requiring a `Class.ModuleScript` caches its returned value. This means that requiring the same singleton `Class.ModuleScript`
from different places consistently provides the same returned object.
The only exception to this rule would be if different environments (client or server) accessed the `Class.ModuleScript`.

Singletons are distinguished from instantiable classes by the fact that they
don't have a `new()` method. Rather, the object along with its methods and
state is returned directly via the `Class.ModuleScript`. As singletons are not
instantiated, the `self` syntax is not used and methods are instead called
with a dot (`.`) rather than a colon (`:`).

## Strict Type Inference

[Luau](../luau/) supports gradual typing which means you're free to add optional
type definitions to some or all of your code. In this project, `strict` typechecking is used for every script. This is the least permissive option for
Roblox's script analysis tool and thus the most likely to catch type errors
before runtime.

<Alert severity="info">
Strong typing is undoubtedly powerful, but it's still an evolving feature in the Luau language and Studio. As a result, there are a number of limitations that, at the time of writing, required workarounds detailed in the following sections.
</Alert>

### Typed Class Syntax

The established approach to creating classes in Lua is [well documented](https://www.lua.org/pil/16.1.html), however it is not well suited to strong Luau typing. In Luau, the simplest approach for getting the type of a class is the `Global.RobloxGlobals.typeof()` method:

```lua
type ClassType = typeof(Class.new())
```

This works but it isn't very useful when your class is initiated with values that only exist at runtime, for example `Class.Player` objects. Additionally, the assumption made in idiomatic Lua class syntax is that declaring a method on a class `self` will always be an instance of that class; this is not an assumption the type inference engine can make.

In order to support strict type inference, the [Plant][planturl] project uses a solution that differs from idiomatic Lua class syntax in a number of ways, some of which may feel non-intuitive:

- The definition of `self` is duplicated, both in the type declaration and in the constructor. This introduces a maintainability burden, but warnings will be flagged if the two definitions fall out of sync with each other.
- Class methods are declared with a dot, so `self` can be explicitly declared to be of type `ClassType`. Methods can still be called with a colon as expected.

```lua
--!strict

local MyClass = {}
MyClass.__index = MyClass

export type ClassType = typeof(setmetatable(
	{} :: {
		property: number,
	},
	MyClass
))

function MyClass.new(property: number): ClassType
	local self = {
		property = property,
	}

	setmetatable(self, MyClass)

	return self
end

function MyClass.addOne(self: ClassType)
	self.property += 1
end

return MyClass
```

### Casting Types After Logical Guards

At the time of writing, the type of a value is not narrowed after a guard conditional statement. For example, following the guard below, the type of `optionalParameter` is not narrowed to `number`.

```lua
--!strict

local function foo(optionalParameter: number?)
	if not optionalParameter then
		return
	end

	print(optionalParameter + 1)
end
```

To mitigate this, new variables are created after these guards with their type explicitly cast.

```lua
--!strict

local function foo(optionalParameter: number?)
	if not optionalParameter then
		return
	end

	local parameter = optionalParameter :: number

	print(parameter + 1)
end
```

### Traversing DataModel Hierarchies

In some cases, the codebase needs to traverse the data model hierarchy of a tree
of objects that are created at runtime. This presents an interesting challenge
for typechecking. At the time of writing, it's not possible to define a generic
data model hierarchy as a type. As a result, there are cases where the only type
information available for a data model structure is the type of the top level
instance.

One approach to this challenge is to cast to `any` and then refine. For example:

```lua
local function enableVendor(vendor: Model)
	local zonePart: BasePart = (vendor :: any).ZonePart
end
```

The problem with this approach is that it impacts readability. Instead, the
project uses a generic module called `getInstance` for traversing data model
hierarchies that casts to `any` internally.

```lua
local function enableVendor(vendor: Model)
	local zonePart: BasePart = getInstance(vendor, "ZonePart")
end
```

As the type engine's understanding of the data model evolves, it's possible that
patterns like this will no longer be necessary.

## User Interface

[Plant][planturl] includes a variety of complex and simple 2D user interfaces. These include non-interactive heads up display (HUD) items like the coin counter and complex interactive menus like the shop.

### UI Approach

You can loosely compare Roblox [UI](../ui/) to the HTML DOM, because it's a
hierarchy of objects that describe what the user should be seeing. Approaches to
creating and updating a Roblox UI are broadly divided into **imperative** and
**declarative** practices.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Approach</th>
    <th>Advantages and Drawbacks</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>**Imperative**</td>
		<td>
			<p>In the imperative approach, UI is treated like any other instance hierarchy on Roblox. The UI structure is created before runtime in Studio and added to the data model, typically directly in `Class.StarterGui`. Then, at runtime, code manipulates specific pieces of the UI to reflect the state the creator requires.</p>
			<p>This approach comes with some advantages. You can create the UI from scratch in Studio and store it in the data model. This is a simple and visual editing experience that can accelerate UI creation. Because imperative UI code only concerns itself with what needs changing, it also makes simple UI changes easy to implement.</p>
			<p>A notable drawback is that, since imperative UI approaches require state to be manually implemented in the form of transformations, complex representations of state can become very hard to find and debug. It's common for errors to emerge when developing imperative UI code, especially when state and the UI becomes desynchronized due to multiple updates interacting in an unexpected order.</p>
			<p>Another challenge with imperative approaches is that it's harder to break down UI into meaningful components that can be declared once and reused. Because the entire UI tree is declared at edit time, common patterns may be repeated in multiple parts of the data model.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>**Declarative**</td>
		<td>
			<p>In the declarative approach, the desired state of UI instances are declared explicitly, and the efficient implementation of this state is abstracted away by libraries such as [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/) or [Fusion](https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion).</p>
			<p>The advantage of this approach is the implementation of state becomes trivial and you only need to describe what you want your UI to look like. This makes identifying and resolving bugs significantly easier.</p>
			<p>The key drawback is having to declare the entire UI tree in code. Libraries like Roact and Fusion have syntax to make this easier, but it's still a time consuming process and a less intuitive editing experience when composing UI.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

[Plant][planturl] uses an **imperative** approach under the notion that showing the transformations directly gives a more effective overview of how UI is created and manipulated on Roblox. This would not be possible with a declarative approach. Some repeated UI structures and logic are also abstracted into reusable [components](#layer-and-components) to avoid a common pitfall in imperative UI design.

### High-Level Architecture

<img src="../assets/resources/plant/Architecture-UI.png" alt="Plant project UI architecture diagram" />

### Layer and Components

In [Plant][planturl], all UI structures are either a `Layer` or a `Component`.

- `Layer` is defined as a top level grouping singleton that wraps prefabricated UI structures in `Class.ReplicatedStorage`. A layer may contain a number of components, or it may encapsulate its own logic entirely. Examples of layers are the inventory menu or the number of coins indicator in the heads up display.
- `Component` is a reusable UI element. When a new component object is instantiated, it clones a prefabricated template from `Class.ReplicatedStorage`. Components may in themselves contain other components. Examples of components are a generic button class or the concept of a list of items.

### View Handling

A common UI management problem is view handling. This project has a range of menus and HUD items, some of which listen to user input, and careful management of when they are visible or enabled is required.

[Plant][planturl] approaches this problem with its **UIHandler** system which manages when a UI layer should or should not be visible. All UI layers in the game are categorized as `HUD` or `Menu` and their visibility is managed by the following rules:

- The enabled state of `Menu` and `HUD` layers can be toggled.
- Enabled `HUD` layers are only shown if no `Menu` layers are enabled.
- Enabled `Menu` layers are stored in a stack, and only one `Menu` layer is visible at a time. When a `Menu` layer is enabled, it is inserted to the front of the stack and shown. When a `Menu` layer is disabled, it is removed from the stack and the next enabled `Menu` layer in the queue is shown.

This approach is intuitive because it allows menus to be navigated with history. If one menu is opened from another menu, closing the new menu will show the old menu again.

UI layer singletons register themselves with the **UIHandler** and are provided with a signal that fires when its visibility should change.
