title: City People Cars
description: A reference Roblox project that includes cars, buildings, and people.
---

City People Cars was originally built as an internal Roblox demo and is now available as a [public technical demo](https://www.roblox.com/games/6300375759/City-People-Cars). You can also [download](../assets/resources/city-people-cars/CityPeopleCars.rbxl) the `.rbxl` file directly.

CPC features a living, breathing city. Cars drive through the streets and obey traffic laws while people walk along the sidewalks. The city was built with a realistic art style, using high detail assets with [PBR textures and surface appearance](../art/modeling/surface-appearance.md) enabled, giving the surfaces additional depth.
