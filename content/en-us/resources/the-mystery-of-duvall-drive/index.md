[The Mystery of Duvall Drive](https://www.roblox.com/games/7902470429/The-Mystery-of-Duvall-Drive) is an official Roblox experience used to showcase Studio's various features and tools to create an immersive environment. Returning from the [Kerr-Newman DSR-14 space station](https://www.roblox.com/games/7208091524/Beyond-the-Dark-Vistech-Showcase), we now invite you to explore the dark abandoned house and its many mysteries in this official demo, which is both uncopylocked and editable in Studio, as well as a great palette of assets and examples that you can model and use similarly in your own experiences!

Similar to the previous [Beyond the Dark](../../resources/beyond-the-dark/index.md) showcase, this document demonstrates the process of going from simple sketches to a rich 3D environment with mind-bending visuals. Our goal is to provide information on both **how** we used Studio tools and **why** we used the features we did to achieve our results, including:

- **`Class.MaterialService`** and custom materials
- **Packages** and their ability to streamline processes
- **Volumetric audio** and `Class.SoundService`
- **Streaming enabled** for complex experiences

You can follow the articles sequentially or jump between the following sections:

- **[Construct the house](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/construct-the-house.md)** explores the transformation from a simple blueprint to the final environment, including the process to ensure the environment was fun from start to finish.
- **[Materialize the world](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/materialize-the-world.md)** details how both `Class.MaterialService` and `Class.SurfaceAppearance` create the look and feel of each room's normal and corrupted state.
- **[Immersive narrative](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/immersive-narrative.md)** demonstrates how to utilize UI features to build lore throughout the playable area.
- **[Stream in immersion](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/stream-in-immersion.md)** explains how we both code and constructed the experience to take advantage of Streaming Enabled capabilities.
- **[Develop a moving world](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/develop-a-moving-world.md)** describes how and why movement can give the world a sense of life and reactiveness.
- **[Design dark soundscapes](../../resources/the-mystery-of-duvall-drive/design-dark-soundscapes.md)** details how `Class.SoundService` and [volumetric audio](../../sound/objects.md#volumetric) craft the distinct soundscapes of the normal and corrupted worlds.
