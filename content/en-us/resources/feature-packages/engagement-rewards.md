The **Engagement Rewards** feature package is a customizable framework for offering in-game rewards for certain player activities, including daily login streaks and play session time. In addition to client and server logic, the package includes a default UI for viewing reward progress, reward status, and claiming rewards.

5. Click the **Feature Package Core** tile, then the **Engagement Rewards Feature Package** tile. Both package folders display in the **Explorer** window.
6. Drag the folders into **ReplicatedStorage**.

## Initialize the package

Moving the packages to **ReplicatedStorage** and testing your experience runs the `EngagementRewardsExample` script in `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Server.Examples`.

This script shows how to initialize the package for use in your experience, which involves requiring several module scripts and defining a `rewardClaimedHandlerFunction()` function that ultimately gives the reward(s) to the player.

This function must return a boolean. In the example script, you can see that it doesn't give any rewards to the player; it just prints the player, reward, and quantity being claimed.

```lua title="EngagementRewardsExample"
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local EngagementRewardsConfig = require(ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Configs.EngagementRewardsConfig)
local EngagementRewards = require(ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Server.EngagementRewards)
local EngagementRewardsUtils = require(ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Utils.EngagementRewardsUtils)
local Types = require(ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Configs.Types)

-- Replace this handler function with your own reward claimed handler function
-- This function should handle the reward claimed event for the rewardId passed in
local function rewardClaimedHandlerFunction(player: Player, rewardId: RewardId, quantity: number): (boolean, string?)
   print(`Reward {rewardId} claimed by {player} with quantity {quantity}`)
   return true
end
-- more
```

You can either modify this script directly or move it to **ServerScriptService** if that's your preferred location for server code. As-is, the script is only useful for testing purposes.

Giving the reward to the player varies by experience. In some experiences, you might confer an experience boost or just increment the player's gold count. In other experiences, you might have a custom inventory system, whereas others might place an item into player backpacks. In all cases, however, you must replace `rewardClaimedHandlerFunction()` with your own function.

## Add rewards and criteria

Most rewards customization occurs within `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Configs.EngagementRewardsConfig`. This module script defines the reward and the requirements for unlocking it.

You can see the full type declarations (or add new ones) in `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Configs.Types`, but you probably only need to work with `EngagementRewardsConfig`. The feature package includes two reward types: `Time` and `Daily`.

```lua
local engagementRewardsConfig: Types.EngagementRewardsConfig = {
   [Types.RewardType.Time] = {
      tabDisplayName = "Time",
      tabOrder = 1,
      description = "Keep playing to unlock rewards!",
      rewards = {
         MinutesPlayed1 = {
            icon = 116913478160966,
            displayName = "Ice Lance",
            requiredSecondsInGame = 1 * 5,
         },
         -- more
   [Types.RewardType.Daily] = {
      tabDisplayName = "Daily",
      tabOrder = 2,
      description = "Play daily to unlock rewards!",
      rewards = {
         DailyStreak1 = {
            icon = 116913478160966,
            displayName = "Ice Lance",
            requiredDaysVisitedStreak = 1,
            effect = Types.RewardEffect.Valuable,
         },
         -- more
```

Both reward types require an icon, which is a Roblox asset ID for an image (**not** a decal). You likely also want a display name for use in the UI. Specify `quantity` for values other than 1. You can also optionally designate a reward as valuable (`effect = Types.RewardEffect.Valuable`) to give it a different background frame in the UI.

Variable | Type | Description | Default | Required
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
icon | Number | A Roblox asset ID for the UI icon. | N/A | Yes
displayName | String | A name for the rewards for use in the UI. | The `RewardId` | No
quantity | Number | The number of items to reward. | 1 | No
effect | RewardEffect | The visual effect to use in the UI. See [Customize the UI](#customize-the-ui). | `Types.RewardEffect.Default` | No

### Time rewards

`Time` rewards unlock after a certain number of seconds in-game. Customize these numbers to meet your needs. You might use small numbers for easy testing, and in the published experience, confer a reward after 10 minutes, another after 30 minutes, another after an hour, and so on.

<Alert severity="info">
Time tracking starts at 0 for each session, so players lose all progress towards `Time` rewards when they leave the game.
</Alert>

Multiplication makes numbers in seconds easier for humans to work with, so for two hours, you might prefer to specify `2 * 60 * 60` rather than `7200`.

Variable | Type | Description | Default | Required
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
requiredSecondsInGame | Number | The number of seconds (a positive integer) the player must spend in-game to earn the reward. | N/A | Yes

### Daily rewards

`Daily` rewards unlock after a certain number of consecutive daily logins. For example, the first day that a player logs in, you might give them three potions or a cinnamon roll. Subsequent days, you might reward more valuable consumables, followed by a durable item, like a new fishing rod, after seven straight days.

Variable | Type | Description | Default | Required
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
requiredDaysVisitedStreak | Number | The number of consecutive days the player must connect to the experience to earn the reward. | N/A | Yes

Two additional daily reward configuration options are available in the `DailyRewardTabConfig`.

```lua
[Types.RewardType.Daily] = {
    tabDisplayName = "Daily",
    tabOrder = 2,
    description = "Play daily to unlock rewards!",
    isHiddenOnJoin = true,
    isAlignedToStreakResetTime = true,
    rewards = {
        DailyStreak1 = {
            icon = 116913478160966,
            displayName = "Ice Lance",
            requiredDaysVisitedStreak = 1,
        },
        -- more
```

Variable | Type | Description | Default | Required
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
isHiddenOnJoin | Boolean | When true, rewards don't pop up automatically when joining the experience. When false, rewards automatically pop up when joining the game if the player has a new daily reward to claim. | False | No
isAlignedToStreakResetTime | Boolean | When true, rewards for day 2 can be claimed 24 hours after the initial day 1 claimable time. When false, day 2 rewards can be claimed at the first midnight after the day 1 claimable time. For example, if a player logs in at 11:00 PM (23:00) and claims their day 1 reward, true means they can't claim the day 2 reward until 11:00 PM the next day. False means they can claim the day 2 reward at 12:00 AM (00:00), one hour later. Rewards for day 3 and beyond are always available 24 hours after the previous day's claimable time. | False | No

## Customize the UI

In the previous section, you might have noticed the `tabDisplayName`, `tabOrder`, and `description` fields, which allow for basic customization of the user interface. You can also find some UI strings in `ReplicatedStorage.FeaturePackagesCore.Configs.TranslationStrings`.

<img src="../../assets/resources/feature-packages/engagement/rewards-annotated.png" width="730" />

- To specify a new reward background using the `effect` variable, add a frame to `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Objects.RewardItemFrames`. Then add the name of the frame to the `Types.RewardEffect` table in `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Configs.Types`.

- For more comprehensive customization, modify the objects in `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Objects`. For example, you might modify the `Class.Frame.BackgroundColor3|BackgroundColor3` of the `RewardsHudButton.Background` frame or the `Class.UIGradient.Color|Color` of `FooterContentFrame.ClaimableUIGradient`.

  <Alert severity="info">
  Be careful if you modify `ReplicatedStorage.FeaturePackagesCore.Objects`; changes to **Core** affect all feature packages.
  </Alert>

- The entry point for the user interface is the `ReplicatedStorage.EngagementRewards.Client.UIController` script, which gets the necessary objects and initializes the UI. If you add or rename top-level objects (as opposed to only adding children or modifying properties), you likely need to update the code in this folder to handle them.
