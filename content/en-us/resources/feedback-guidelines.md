Following our submission guidelines can help us quickly reproduce any issues you might have encountered.

## Include key details

  If the behavior occurs inconsistently, note how often it occurs and the situations in which it seems to occur most often.

- If the content is inaccurate or misleading, include the problematic text or section header. Feel free to suggest an improved wording.
