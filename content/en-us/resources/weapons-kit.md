title: Weapons Kit
description: The Weapons Kit assists in creating competitive combat-based experiences.
---

To assist in creating competitive combat-based experiences, several endorsed weapons are available for use in any experience. The core system features projectile-based weapons with an over-the-shoulder camera, and setting the projectile speed high enough can simulate raycasting weapons like laser guns.

1. On the weapon's item page, click the green **Get** button and confirm the transaction.
1. In Studio, open the [Toolbox](../projects/assets/toolbox.md) (**View** &rarr; **Toolbox**).
1. Select your toolbox **Inventory** section.
1. Locate the weapon and click it to add it into the place. When prompted whether to put the tool into the starter pack, click **Yes** if you want players to start with the weapon in their backpack, or click **No** to simply place the weapon in the 3D world as a pickup.
1. If this is the **first time** bringing in an endorsed weapon, move its **WeaponsSystem** folder into **ServerScriptService** to serve as the unified [system folder](#system-folder-structure) for all endorsed weapons in the experience.

   <img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Move-WeaponsSystem-Folder.png" width="320" />

## System Folder Structure

The **WeaponsSystem** folder is a unified folder that contains assets, configurations, and scripts that power all endorsed weapons in the experience. If located in **ServerScriptService**, it overrides any equivalent **WeaponsSystem** folders that may reside within individual weapons.

<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/WeaponsSystem-Structure.png" width="320" />

The **WeaponsSystem** folder contains the following instances:

- **Assets** (`Class.Folder`)
  - **Animations** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Storage for animations used in the weapons systems.
  - **Effects** (`Class.Folder`) - **Casings** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Storage for all bullet casing assets. - **HitMarks** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Storage for all hit mark effects. - **Shots** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Storage for all shot effects.
  - **WeaponsSystemGui** (`Class.ScreenGui`) &ndash; Settings for the [Weapons System GUI](#weapons-system-gui).
- **Configuration** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Configuration values for the weapons system.
  - **SlowZoomWalkEnabled** (`Class.BoolValue`) &ndash; Setting for [sprint control](#sprint-and-zoom-control).
  - **SprintEnabled** (`Class.BoolValue`) &ndash; Setting for [sprint control](#sprint-and-zoom-control).
- **Libraries** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Stores all other `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` used in the weapons system.
- **WeaponTypes** (`Class.Folder`) &ndash; Specifies all weapon types.
- **ServerWeaponsScript** (`Class.Script`)
- **Version** (`Class.IntValue`)
- **ClientWeaponScript** (`Class.LocalScript`)
- **NetworkingCallbacks** (`Class.ModuleScript`)
- **WeaponData** (`Class.RemoteEvent`)
- **WeaponsSystem** (`Class.ModuleScript`)

Within the **WeaponsSystem** folder, different aspects are controlled by the following `Class.ModuleScript|ModuleScripts`:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Handled Primarily Within...</th>
  </tr>

## Weapon Structure

Endorsed weapons are `Class.Tool|Tools` and are named as they will appear in the player's backpack. Each weapon is structured with a similar hierarchy.

### Weapon Type

The **WeaponType** `Class.StringValue` corresponds with the `Class.ModuleScript` for the weapon in the **WeaponsSystem**/**WeaponTypes** folder. The two base values are **BulletWeapon** and **BowWeapon**.

### Weapon Model

Each weapon contains a `Class.Model` made up of one or more `Class.BasePart|BaseParts` to form the physical weapon. One of these should be set as the model's `Class.Model.PrimaryPart|PrimaryPart`.

<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Model-BaseParts.png" width="320" />

The model also includes the following important descendants which may be parented to one of the model's `Class.BasePart|BaseParts`:

- **TipAttachment** &ndash; `Class.Attachment` whose position on the parent `Class.BasePart` determines where bullets/projectiles come out.
- **HandleAttachment** &ndash; `Class.Attachment` whose position on the parent `Class.BasePart` determines where the **Handle** is welded.
- **Fired** <Chip label="optional" size="small" variant="outlined" /> &ndash; `Class.Sound` that plays when the weapon is fired.
- **Reload** <Chip label="optional" size="small" variant="outlined" /> &ndash; `Class.Sound` that plays when the weapon is reloaded.
- Additional descendants for any [specialized options](#specialized-options).

### Weapon Handle

The **Handle** part determines where a player character holds the weapon. This must be a `Class.Part`, it must be named **Handle**, and it must be a direct child of the weapon (tool).

### Configuration Folder

The **Configuration** folder contains specific "value" types for weapon behavior. Beyond the defaults, you can add additional configuration items for [specialized options](#specialized-options) when applicable.

As follows are the base configurations and their default values:

<table>

  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>

## Specialized Options

You can add/modify the following options for any weapon. These customizations require modifying either the weapon's `Class.Model`, the weapon's `Class.Configuration`, or both. Some configurations are dependent on others, such as [Muzzle Particles](#muzzle-particles) which require the necessary children for [Projectile/Hit Effects and Sounds](#projectilehit-effects-and-sounds).

### Bolt Animations and Sounds

A weapon's **bolt** is the part that moves back and forth each time it's fired.

#### Muzzle Particles

This option emits particles from the specified `Class.ParticleEmitter` at the weapon's **TipAttachment** `Class.Attachment` when it's fired.

Configuration descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Configuration-Children.png"
   width="35%" />

- **ShotEffect** (`Class.StringValue`) — Name of a shot effect stored within `WeaponsSystem/Assets/Effects/Shots`.
- **NumMuzzleParticles** (`Class.IntValue`) (optional) — Number of muzzle particles that will be emitted; default is **50**.

For the specified shot effect, add a ParticleEmitter asset within `WeaponsSystem/Assets/Effects/Shots` named **MuzzleParticles**.

<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-MuzzleParticles.png"
   width="35%" />

### Muzzle Flashes

This option creates a `Class.Beam` flash effect when the weapon is fired.

Model descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Model-Descendants.png"
   width="35%" />

- **MuzzleFlash0** (`Class.Attachment`) — Used to specify one side of muzzle flash. Position doesn't matter.
- **MuzzleFlash1** (`Class.Attachment`) — Used to specify opposite side of muzzle flash. Position doesn't matter.
- **MuzzleFlash** (`Class.Beam`) — Make sure to set `Attachment0` to **MuzzleFlash0** and `Attachment1` to **MuzzleFlash1**.

Configuration descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Configuration-Children.png"
   width="35%" />

- **MuzzleFlashTime** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Length of time muzzle flash will show for; default is **0.03**.
- **MuzzleFlashRotation0** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Minimum rotation of muzzle flash; default is **-math.pi**.
- **MuzzleFlashRotation1** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Maximum rotation of muzzle flash; default is **math.pi**.
- **MuzzleFlashSize0** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Minimum size of muzzle flash; default is **1**.
- **MuzzleFlashSize1** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Maximum size of muzzle flash; default is **1**.

### Particle Trails

This option creates a trail of varying length from the weapon to the projectile impact point.

Configuration descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Configuration-Children.png"
   width="35%" />

- **TrailLength** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Length of trail behind bullet/projectile; default is `nil` which means the trail length will instead be calculated using **TrailLengthFactor**.
- **TrailLengthFactor** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — The trail length will be set to this value multiplied by the distance the bullet/projectile traveled in the last frame; default is **1**. Note that this will be overridden if you include **TrailLength**.
- **ShowEntireTrailUntilHit** (`Class.BoolValue`) (optional) — Set to **true** to render the trail from the weapon tip all the way to wherever the projectile is; this will override both **TrailLength** and **TrailLengthFactor** and the trail will only disappear once the projectile hits something. Set to **false** to use one of the above two options to calculate trail length. Default is **false**.

### Hit Marks

This visual addition appears on the surface where projectiles hit and is useful for arrows, bullet holes, scorch marks, etc.

Configuration descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Configuration-Children.png"
   width="35%" />

- **HitMarkEffect** (`Class.StringValue`) (optional) — Name of hit mark effect stored within `WeaponsSystem/Assets/Effects/HitMarks`; default is **BulletHole**.
- **AlignHitMarkToNormal** (`Class.BoolValue`) (optional) — Set to **true** if the hit mark should always align flat against the surface like a bullet hole, or **false** if the hit mark should appear stuck in the surface from the direction the projectile came from (like an arrow). Default is **true**.

You can add the following optional asset within `WeaponsSystem/Assets/Effects/HitMarks`:

<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-BulletHole.png"
   width="35%" />

- **Glow** (`Class.Decal`) (optional) — Appears on the hit surface fully opaque, then rapidly gets more transparent, like a glowing effect on the surface that fades quickly. Useful for things like showing a glowing red mark where explosives hit.
- **BulletHole** (`Class.Decal`) (optional) — Appears on the hit surface fully opaque and, after 4 seconds, fades to transparent over 1 second.
- **ImpactBillboard** (`Class.BillboardGui`) (optional) — Displays at the hit surface, always facing towards the camera.
  - **Impact** (`Class.ImageLabel`) (optional) — Direct child of **ImpactBillboard**; this begins fully opaque, grows to the full size of the **ImpactBillboard** over 0.1 seconds, then shrinks to half its size and fades to full transparency over 0.1 seconds.
- Any `Class.Part`/`Class.MeshPart`/`Class.SpecialMesh` that you want to appear as a physical projectile (optional). For example, including an arrow `Class.MeshPart` and setting **AlignHitMarkToNormal** noted above to **false** will make the arrow stick out of the surface from the direction you shot it.

### Exploding Projectiles

Projectiles can include an Explosion object to damage player characters in an area around the impact point.

- **ChargeRate** (`Class.NumberValue`) — Rate at which the weapon will charge. This value must be specified to indicate that the weapon uses charging.
- **DischargeRate** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Rate at which the weapon will discharge; default is **0** which means the weapon will not discharge at all.
- **ChargePassively** (`Class.BoolValue`) (optional) — Set to **true** if you want the weapon to passively charge so it will shoot instantly when you click, or **false** if you want to click/touch to charge the weapon and have it fire once full charge is reached. Default is **false**.
- **ChargingParticlesRatePerCharge** (`Class.IntValue`) (optional) — Number of particles that will emit out of all **ChargingParticles** emitters multiplied by the current charge of the weapon. Default is **20**, meaning that if the weapon charge is at 10%, each ChargingParticles emitter will emit 2 particles (20×0.1), and if the weapon charge is at 90%, each emitter will emit 18 particles (20×0.9).
- **FireDischarge** (`Class.NumberValue`) (optional) — Amount of charge the weapon will lose after firing a fully charged shot; default is **1**.

- **NumDischargeCompleteParticles** (`Class.IntValue`) (optional) — Number of particles the - **DischargeCompleteParticles** emitter will emit when the weapon is completely discharged. Default is **25**.

### Bow Weapon

A bow weapon like the Crossbow can include a realistic string and arms construction, as well as a visual arrow nocked to the string.

In addition to adding model descendants, you need to apply the following:

- Make the weapon into a [charging weapon](#charging-weapon). For example, add the required **ChargeRate** within the weapon's `Class.Configuration` that specifies how fast the string is drawn. Additionally, consider adding optional descendants to the weapon's `Class.Model` such as a **Charging** sound for the string/arms being pulled back.
- Set the **WeaponType** to **BowWeapon** as indicated in [Weapon Structure](#weapon-structure).

Model descendants:
<img src="../assets/resources/weapons-kit/Weapon-Model-Descendants-Crossbow.png"
   width="35%" />

- **LeftString** (`Class.Beam`) (optional) — The visual left half of the string.
- **RightString** (`Class.Beam`) (optional) — The visual right half of the string.
- **Arrow** (`Class.BasePart`) (optional) — The arrow that appears when the bow is fully drawn. Note that this is only for visual appearance on the bow (the actual fired arrow will be a **ShotEffect** as outlined in [Projectile/Hit Effects and Sounds](#projectilehit-effects-and-sounds)).
- **String1** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — The center point of the string.
- **StringLoose** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **String1** should be when the bow is at rest.
- **StringTight** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **String1** should be when the bow is fully drawn.
- **Arms** (`Class.Part`) (optional) — A part that just serves as an internal indicator that the bow arms will be animated. This may contain the following direct children:
- **LeftString0** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where the left side of the string is attached to the bow.
- **RightString0** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where the right side of the string is attached to the bow.
- **LeftLoose** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **LeftString0** should be when the bow is at rest.
- **RightLoose** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **RightString0** should be when the bow is at rest.
- **LeftTight** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **LeftString0** should be when the bow is fully drawn.
- **RightTight** (`Class.Attachment`) (optional) — Point where **RightString0** should be when the bow is fully drawn.
- [SpecialMesh] (`Class.SpecialMesh`) (optional) — The part of the bow that will actually bend when the bow is drawn. Note that you must specify the following four `Class.Vector3Value` objects to make this animate.
- **LooseOffset** (`Class.Vector3Value`) (optional) — Offset of the `Class.SpecialMesh` when the bow is at rest.
- **TightOffset** (`Class.Vector3Value`) (optional) — Offset of the `Class.SpecialMesh` when the bow is fully drawn.

- **TightScale** (`Class.Vector3Value`) (optional) — Scale of the `Class.SpecialMesh` when the bow is fully drawn.

## Weapons System GUI

The core weapons system interfaces with this system to update the GUI based on things like spread of the gun, indicators for when you get hit or hit others, etc.

The **WeaponsSystemGui** is a `Class.ScreenGui` object in `WeaponsSystem/Assets` that is parented to `Class.PlayerGui` when the experience starts. WeaponSystemGui has 4 descendants:

- [ScalingElements](#scaling-elements) - A `Class.Folder` of on-screen elements.
- [LargeTouchscreen](#largetouchscreen) - A `Class.Frame` for buttons on large touchscreens.
- [Scope](#scope) - A `Class.Frame` for zooming in with weapons that use a scope.
- [SmallTouchscreen](#smalltouchscreen) - A `Class.Frame` for buttons on small touchscreens.

### Scaling Elements

ScalingElements is a `Class.Folder` parented under WeaponsSystemGui with the following descendants:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Instance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>DirectionalIndicators</td>
    <td>`Class.Folder`</td>
    <td>A `Class.Folder` where all [directional indicators](#create-a-directional-indicator) are stored.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crosshair</td>
    <td>`Class.Frame`</td>
    <td>A `Class.Frame` containing the following objects:<br /><br />[UIAspectRationConstraint] - `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`<br />**Bottom** - `Class.ImageLabel`<br />**Left** - `Class.ImageLabel`<br />**Right** - `Class.ImageLabel`<br />**Top** - `Class.ImageLabel`</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HitMarker</td>
    <td>`Class.Frame`</td>
    <td>A `Class.Frame` containing the following objects:<br /><br />[UIAspectRatioConstraint] - `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`<br />**HitMarkerImage** - `Class.ImageLabel` that appears and fades when the player successfully hits another player character.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### LargeTouchscreen

LargeTouchscreen is a `Class.Frame` containing buttons that display on large touchscreens. LargeTouchscreen has the following descendants:

- AimButton (`Class.ImageButton`)
- FireButton (`Class.ImageButton`)

### Scope

Scope is a `Class.Frame` that contains **ScopeImage** (`Class.ImageLabel`) which shows up when zooming on a weapon with HasScope enabled (see [Weapon Structure](#weapon-structure)).

**Scope** has the following descendants:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Instance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>ScopeInstance</td>
    <td>`Class.Frame`</td>
    <td>A `Class.Frame` containing the following assets used when zooming on a weapon with HasScope enabled:<br /><br />[UIAspectRationConstraint] - `Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`<br />**BottomBlack** - `Class.Frame`<br />**LeftBlack** - `Class.Frame`<br />**RightBlack** - `Class.Frame`<br />**TopBlack** - `Class.Frame`</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### SmallTouchscreen

SmallTouchScreen is a `Class.Frame` containing buttons that display on small touchscreens. SmallTouchscreen has the following descendants:

- AimButton (`Class.ImageButton`)
- FireButton (`Class.ImageButton`)

### Create a Directional Indicator

Directional indicators are used to show the direction of something around the player's crosshair. For example, if someone shoots you, a red semi-circle can show up around your crosshair in the direction the shot came from. Other examples include indicators to show the direction of footsteps, indirect gunfire, or even environmental objects such as chests.

To create a new indicator, add a new Indicator `Class.Frame` in `WeaponsSystemGui/ScalingElements/DirectionalIndicators` with the following structure:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Instance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>[UIAspectRationConstraint] </td>
    <td>`Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[ImageLabel]</td>
    <td>`Class.ImageLabel`</td>
    <td>Image of the directional indicator. Tweaking the rotation of the image in Studio may be required unless you upload the image so that it's facing down and there's little or no blank space around it.<br />This image label must also contain its own <br />`Class.UIAspectRatioConstraint`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[Configuration]</td>
    <td>`Class.Configuration`</td>
    <td>Contains optional properties to adjust. See [Indicator Configuration](#indicator-configuration) for more information.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Once created, you can activate an indicator via the following command inside `WeaponsSystem/Libraries/WeaponsGui` where `indicatorName` is the string name of the indicator to activate and worldPos is the world position where the directional indicator should point:

```lua
self.DirectionalIndicatorGuiManager:ActivateDirectionalIndicator(indicatorName, worldPos)
```

<Alert severity="info">
If an indicator is activated an additional time before it has had time to fade completely, a new indicator of that type will be instantiated. This allows an unlimited number of any type of indicator to be activated at the same time.

You can also activate directional indicators from outside of WeaponsGui by replacing self in the above code with the instance of `WeaponsGui` in your code. However, it's recommended that you activate it from inside `WeaponsGui` and trigger it via a `Class.RemoteEvent` or a `Class.BindableEvent`. For reference, see how `DamageIndicator` is activated within `WeaponsGui`.
</Alert>

#### Indicator Configuration

The DirectionalIndicators can be further modified by adjusting the `Class.Configuration` object parented under the `[Indicator]`. All of these settings have a default value, so there is no need to set configurations when not modifying a setting.

The following configurations can be set:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Instance Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>DistanceLevelFromCenter</td>
    <td>`Class.NumberValue`</td>
    <td>Number of distance levels from the center of the screen (each distance level is about 0.03 screen scale); default is **6**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>FadeTime</td>
    <td>`Class.NumberValue`</td>
    <td>Indicator fade time following its activation and the `TimeBeforeFade` time; default is **1**. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>`Class.StringValue`</td>
    <td>Name of the directional indicator as you want to reference it in code; default is the name of the indicator's top level `Class.Frame`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TimeBeforeFade</td>
    <td>`Class.NumberValue`</td>
    <td>Number of seconds that the indicator will appear for before fading; default is **1**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TransparencyBeforeFade</td>
    <td>`Class.NumberValue`</td>
    <td>Transparency of the indicator before it starts to fade; default is **0**.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WidthLevel</td>
    <td>`Class.NumberValue`</td>
    <td>Number of width levels from center (each width level is about 0.03 screen scale); default is the value of **DistanceLevelFromCenter**.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Show Damage Billboard

The damage billboard is used to show little numbers above a character's head when they are damaged. These will only show up for the player that damaged another player's character, not for spectating players.

Damage billboards are handled in `WeaponsSystem/Libraries/DamageBillboardHandler` and can be activated from any client-side code as follows, where damage is the amount of damage done and adornmentPart is the part on which to adorn the billboard, such as the victim's head:

```lua
DamageBillboardHandler:ShowDamageBillboard(damage, adornmentPart)
```

## Shoulder Camera

The shoulder camera is a third-person camera that looks over the player character's right shoulder. To customize the shoulder camera, modify the variables under the -- Configuration parameters (constants) comment in the `ShoulderCamera.new()` function of `WeaponsSystem/Libraries/ShoulderCamera`. You can modify things such as field of view, offset from the character, walk speed while [sprinting or zooming](#sprint-and-zoom-control), etc.

## Sprint and Zoom Control

By default, the weapons system adds "sprint" capability, so players can sprint by holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, pushing fully up on the dynamic thumbstick (mobile), or pushing fully up on the left joystick (gamepad). If you want to disable sprinting, set the value of **SprintEnabled** within **WeaponsSystem**/**Configuration** to **false**.

The system also reduces player speed while they're aiming/zooming, but you can disable this behavior by setting the value of **SlowZoomWalkEnabled** to **false**.
