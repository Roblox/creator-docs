</Alert>

The [Creator Affiliate Program](https://create.roblox.com/affiliate) is a pilot program that lets you earn Robux using affiliate links. With it, you can:

- Generate affiliate share links for any Roblox experience, including other developers' experiences, through the Creator Hub.
- Promote your affiliate links off-platform on social media channels.
- Earn revenue in Robux whenever new users create a Roblox account and purchase Robux using your affiliate link. A new user is someone who doesn't already have an alternative Roblox account.
- Exchange your Robux earnings for real-world money using the Developer Exchange program.

When a user creates a Roblox account using your affiliate link and then buys Robux, you can receive up to 50% of the value of their Robux purchases during their first six months on the platform, for a maximum revenue of \$100 USD per new user. For example, if a new user joins Roblox and purchases \$100 USD of Robux, you can earn up to \$50 USD, minus certain fees like taxes and VAT.

You receive your revenue in Robux, which you can exchange for real-world money through Developer Exchange.
