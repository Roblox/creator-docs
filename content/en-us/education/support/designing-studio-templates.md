description: Educators can create templates to use in a classroom or for a lesson. Templates make it easy for students to make their own projects.

Educators can create templates to kickstart a student's project in Roblox Studio. These templates can be fully realized experiences, or pre-existing Roblox templates customized with your organization's branding.

This guide outlines the process of creating a template and making it accessible to students.

## Benefits of templates

One benefit of templates is they can provide students a **curated** set of assets to work with, such as 3D models or scripts. This can be a great alternative to having students create their own assets, which can be time consuming, or using models from the Toolbox.

Premade assets can also be a part of lesson plans. Such as challenging students to create apply urban planning to design a city, or perhaps debug a set of scripts.

Templates already installed in Roblox Studio can also be customized to include **branding**, such as your organization's logo.

## Customize or develop a template

Templates can be any Roblox project designed in Roblox Studio.

One way of creating a custom template is to **modify an existing** template in Roblox Studio. Studio includes multiple pre-made games that can be customized.

Another way of creating a custom template is to **design a new one**. Though, depending on the scale of your template, this could even be providing a blank workspace with premade scripts.

## Publish a template

To distribute a template, you'll **publish** it to Roblox. Once on the Roblox cloud, students can access it online from any machine, without having to worry about local storage and file transfers.

Templates can be published either as individual Roblox users or [groups](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313730-How-to-Make-and-Join-Groups). Each has its own benefits.

<Alert severity="warning">
  If your organization chooses to run a group, only allow your developers inside
  that group. Do not allow students to join. If in a group, a student may
  accidentally make unintended modifications to a template.
</Alert>

### Publish the template

With a template ready, it can be published to Roblox, so students can access it online. Once a template is published, educators are responsible for sharing it through a learning management system such as Google Classroom or a messaging system like email.

1. In Roblox Studio, in the top-left, click on **File** ⟩ **Publish to Roblox As**.

   <Alert severity="info">
   When students open a template, the first thing they see will be the view of
   the template where it was last saved. To do this, before publishing use the
   camera controls to position the in-game view to where you expect students to
   start working.
   </Alert>

2. At the bottom left of the pop-up, click **Create new game**.

3. Complete the basic info, such as **name** and **description**. This will be shown to all students on the template's Roblox webpage.
4. In the **Creator** field, click on the dropdown. Individual developers should use **Me**, while those in development groups should use the name of that group.

5. Finish by clicking the **Create** button.

### Set up the template to copy

Even though the template is now published on Roblox, students need to be able to copy it in their own version of Studio.

1. In the same template, select **File** ⟩ **Experience Settings**.

   <Alert severity="info">
   <AlertTitle>Adding Screenshots and Icons</AlertTitle>
   On your experience's webpage, [screenshots](../../production/publishing/thumbnails.md) and an [icon](../../production/publishing/experience-icons.md) will be shown to students. While optional, adding these can boost the look of your template and serve as an additional opportunity for branding.
   </Alert>

2. Click on the **Permissions** tab, set **Playability** to **Public**.
3. In the **Places** tab, click on the **&ctdot;** icon and select **Configure Place**.

4. Scroll down to find **Allow Copying** and toggle it **On**. Once this property is on, it's possible for any Roblox user to access your template. For alternatives, see the card under the image.

   <Alert severity="info">
   <AlertTitle>Sharing Only in Your Organization</AlertTitle>
   There are situations in which you'd want to share a template, but only with a certain set of students. In this situation, we recommend sharing local files.
   </Alert>

5. Once your template is ready, in Studio, go to **File** ⟩ **Download a Copy**. This creates a shareable `.rbxl` file.
6. Distribute the `.rbxl` file as desired.

## Share templates with students

Templates can now be shared by having students go to the template's web page. There, students can click a link that opens a copy of that template in Roblox Studio.

1. To share the template, send the **URL** to the template's game page through a learning management system (such as Google Classroom) or student email. When sending the URL, we recommend removing the place name. It's possible a place name may change, but an ID number won't.

   <Alert severity="info">
   <AlertTitle>Sharing Only in Your Organization</AlertTitle>

   When sending the URL, we recommend removing the place name. It's possible a
   place name may change, but an ID number won't.

   </Alert>

2. Once the student opens the link, instruct them to click on the **...** icon and select **Edit**. If Roblox Studio is installed, it will automatically open the template in that software.
