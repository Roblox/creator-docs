This document shows students how to create accounts online and log into Roblox
Studio. Students should have Roblox Studio installed and tested on their
computers before continuing.

## Create new accounts

1. If you're completely new to Roblox, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for a free account</a>.
2. Have students document their account information somewhere safe.

## Account safety

Once students have created accounts, be sure to cover tips to keep their accounts safe.

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** - If your username is _bloxcool_, your password should **not** be _bloxcool123_.
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** - Report anyone who asks using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312410) feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** - Never trust players or sites who say they have a secret way to get free Robux!
