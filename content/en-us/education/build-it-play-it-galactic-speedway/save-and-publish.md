It's a good idea to publish your game every ten minutes while you're working or whenever you make a big change. Once published, you can edit it from any computer. For now, your game will be private, but once the driftspeeder is ready, you'll make it public for everyone to play.

1. Select **File** → **Publish to Roblox** to open the publishing window.

2. Enter a place name and an optional description.

3. When ready, click the **Create** button.
