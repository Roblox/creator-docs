Swap driftspeeders with your friends by sharing it as an asset. Assets are parts of a Roblox game, like a 3D model or sound, that are stored online.

To share your speeder with friends:

1. Select your driftspeeder. In the **Explorer**, right-click the highlighted speeder model and select **Save to Roblox**.
2. Give the model a **name** and **description**. This information is used so other players can search for new models and understand what they're downloading.

3. Scroll down and turn on **Allow Copying**. This lets your friends and anyone on Roblox import the driftspeeder into their own game.

## Viewing and Using Models

If you've added models from friends, or just want to reuse your own, find them in the **Inventory**. This stores any models you've added and lets you add them into a game.

**Getting Speeders from Friends**

1. Ask a friend to share the link to their 3D model asset. Each link should follow a formula like this: `www.roblox.com/library/0123456789/My-Speeder`

2. Open the link in your web browser.

3. On the page for the asset, click the Get button to add it into your inventory.
