Swap driftspeeders with your friends by sharing it as an asset. Assets are parts of a Roblox game, like a 3D model or sound, that are stored online.

To share your speeder with friends:

1. Select your driftspeeder. In the **Explorer** window, right-click the highlighted speeder model and select **Save to Roblox** from the contextual menu. The **Asset Configuration** window displays.
1. Give the model a **name** and **description**. This information is used so other players can search for new models and understand what they're downloading.

1. Click the **Submit** button. The **Asset Configuration** window displays two links to see your asset on the Creator Dashboard.

1. Click the link to the **Configure** page. Your default web browser opens.

1. Under the **Distribution** section, enable the **Distribute on Creator Store** toggle. This allows your friends to copy your speeder into their inventory.

## View and use models

If you've added models from friends, or just want to reuse your own, find them in the **Inventory**. This stores any models you've added and lets you add them into a game.

1. Ask a friend to share the link to their 3D model asset. Each link should follow a formula like this: `www.roblox.com/library/0123456789/My-Speeder`

1. Open the link in your web browser.

1. On the page for the asset, click the **Get Model** button to add it into your inventory.

1. In Studio, find the **Toolbox**. If it's not open, enable it by going to the **Home** tab and clicking the **Toolbox** button.

1. Make sure the left dropdown is set to **My Models**, then find and click on your friend's speeder. This will add the speeder into your experience.

If you just uploaded a model, you might see a temporary placeholder instead of a thumbnail. It may take some time until the new asset has been reviewed by Roblox moderators.
