Enter the space race of the millennia! No ship, no problem. All racers will be asked to design custom driftspeeders using what can be found on the abandoned galactic spaceyard of Junker's Canyon. Using Roblox Studio, learn how to combine parts to make spaceships that can survive racing in this beautiful alien ~~deathtrap~~, _ahem_ landscape.

## Download Roblox Studio

To start, you'll need Roblox Studio. This program is used to create every game on Roblox and is available free for **PC** and **Mac**.

If you've played Roblox games on your computer, you already have Studio installed. While creating, we strongly recommend using a **3-button mouse with a scroll wheel**.

<Alert severity="info">
If you're completely new to Roblox, follow these instructions to get started:
1. [Sign up for an account.](https://www.roblox.com/account/signupredir)
2. Download [Roblox Studio.](https://www.roblox.com/create)
3. After installing, double-click the Roblox Studio desktop icon (Windows) or click the dock icon (Mac).
4. On the login screen, enter your Roblox username and password, then click **Log In**.

With your new account, remember these safety tips:

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** -- If your username is "bloxdev," your password should not be "bloxdev123."
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** -- Report anyone who asks using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203312410)feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** -- Never trust players or sites who say they have a secret way to get free Robux!
