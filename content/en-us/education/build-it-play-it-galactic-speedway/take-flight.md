Before designing your own driftspeeder, try flying a test speeder that's already in the garage to get an idea of the environment.

1. Click **Play** to test.

2. Walk up to the robot, Maja-M35, and press <kbd>E</kbd>.

   Below are controls for in-game.

   <table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Control</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Move</b></td>
      <td><kbd>W A S D</kbd> or arrow keys</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Rotate</b></td>
      <td>Hold the right mouse button and look around.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Pan</b></td>
      <td>Hold the middle mouse button to drag your camera around.</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

3. Select **Race** from the menu options. In a race, you'll fly through rings to make the fastest time.

4. For now, there's only one driftspeeder in the garage to choose from. Select it and then click **Start**.

5. Wait for the countdown to finish. While inside, take a minute to get used to flying with the controls below. Since you can't use the mouse while flying, remember to **exit** the speeder by pressing <kbd>E</kbd>.

   Below are controls for the speeder.

   <table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Control</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Move the Speeder</b></td>
      <td><kbd>W A S D</kbd> or arrow keys</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Boost Speed</b></td>
      <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><b>Exit the Speeder</b></td>
      <td><kbd>E</kbd></td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

6. Stop playing by pressing the red square or press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.
