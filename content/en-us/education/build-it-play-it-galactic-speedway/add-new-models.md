Change your driftspeeder's look or create a new one with this kit of extra parts. Once you finish designing an even better speeder, get a new avatar item by testing your knowledge in a game.

## Add to your inventory

Get extra parts to work with by importing an asset. Assets are parts of a Roblox game, like a 3D model or sound, that are stored online.

1. Open the link to the kit below in your web browser.
   <a href="https://www.roblox.com/library/4439504355/Driftspeeder-Parts">
   <Button variant="contained">Driftspeeder Parts</Button>
   </a>

2. On the page for the asset, click the **Get** button to add it into your inventory.

## Import into the game

All assets can be found in your **Inventory**. This stores any models you've added and lets you add them into a game.

1. In Studio, find the **Toolbox**. If it's not visible, open it from the **Window** menu.

2. Select the **Inventory** tab.
