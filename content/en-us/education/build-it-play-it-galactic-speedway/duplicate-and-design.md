As you build, parts can be used more than once by creating duplicates. This is useful for reusing a part from the scrapyard, or copying something already added to the speeder.

1. Click the wing you just added and duplicate it (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>).
   Nothing obvious will happen. With collisions off, the wing overlaps the original.

2. Use the **Move**, **Rotate**, and **Scale** tools to position it differently than the first.

   <AlertTitle>Get Precise Rotation</AlertTitle>
   Instead of rotating by a set amount, you can rotate freely by turning off rotation snapping. In the **Model** tab, next to **Rotate**, uncheck the box. Just remember to turn it back on when you're done.

## Continue building

Now that you know how to work with parts, add as many wings as you'd like to create a cool design. Use the following designs as inspiration:

</GridContainer>

## Add decorations

Further personalize your speeder with decorative parts like thrusters or spoilers from the third section of the scrapyard.

Below are two different speeders with decorations.

  Build further away from the body by using parts to extend where you can place objects.
