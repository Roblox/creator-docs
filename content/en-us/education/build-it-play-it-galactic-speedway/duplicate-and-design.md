As you build, parts can be used more than once by creating duplicates. This is useful for reusing a part from the scrapyard, or copying something already added to the speeder.

1. Click the wing you just added and duplicate it (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>). Nothing obvious will happen in the 3D viewport because with collisions off, the wing overlaps the original.
1. Use the **Move**, **Rotate**, and **Scale** tools to position it differently than the first.

   <Alert severity="info">
   <AlertTitle>Get Precise Rotation</AlertTitle>
   Instead of rotating by a set amount, you can rotate freely by turning off rotation snapping. In the toolbar, next to **Rotate**, uncheck the box. Just remember to turn it back on when you're done.

## Continue building

Now that you know how to work with parts, add as many wings as you'd like to create a cool design.

Use the following designs as inspiration:

</GridContainer>

## Add decorations

Further personalize your speeder with decorative parts like thrusters or spoilers from the third section of the scrapyard.

Below are two different speeders with decorations.
