Before moving on, take time to check that your speeder works correctly.

1. Click **Play** to test.

2. In the experience, walk up to the robot character under the spaceship sign and press <kbd>E</kbd> to open up a menu. On that screen, select **Race** and pick your speeder in the selection menu.

3. While flying, make sure that your driftspeeder looks as you intended. Then **stop** the playtest and, if needed, fix any issues. Remember, you can stop playtesting with <kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd>.

## Troubleshoot the speeder

If your driftspeeder does not show up in the selection screen, check the following steps:

**Make sure the speeder is in the Garage.**

1. Click on your speeder to help locate it in the **Explorer** window.
2. In the **Explorer** window, check that it's inside the **Garage** folder.
3. If not in **Garage**, use **Cut** and **Paste Into** to move it there.

**Check that the speeder has a Body.**

The code in game only loads speeders that have a Body part grouped within its model.
