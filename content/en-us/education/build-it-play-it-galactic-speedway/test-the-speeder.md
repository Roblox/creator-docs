Before moving on, take time to check that your speeder works correctly.

1. Click **Play**.
2. To take your speeder for a test flight, talk to the robot, Maja-M35. Then select **Race** and pick your speeder in the selection menu.

3. While flying, make sure that your driftspeeder looks as you intended. Then **stop** the playtest and, if needed, fix any issues. Remember, you can stop playtesting with <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.

## Troubleshoot the speeder

If your driftspeeder does not show up in the selection screen, check the following steps:

**Make sure the speeder is in the _Garage_.**

1. Click on your speeder to help locate it in the Explorer.
2. In the Explorer, check that it's inside the **_Garage_** folder.
3. If not in **_Garage_**, use **Cut** and **Paste Into** to move it there.

**Check that the speeder has a _Body_.**

- The code in game only loads speeders that have a Body part grouped within its model.
