Change the season of Junker's Canyon or make it look even more alien by painting new textures and colors onto the landscape.

## Paint textures

You can use the **Terrain Paint** tool to add snow, water, or even lava into your world.

1. From the **Home** tab, click **Terrain** to open the **Terrain Editor**.

2. The editor will open on the left. To paint:

   a. Click on the **Edit** Tab.

   b. Then, click on the **Paint** tool.

3. Select a material, such as Snow. To paint, left click and drag on any terrain. Paint changes the look without changing the shape.

   </GridContainer>

4. Paint terrain until your game looks completely different from the original. Experiment with different materials, like grass or water, and brush sizes.

## Change texture colors

Being on an alien planet, not all grass has to be green. Try changing the color of the terrain you paint, turning snow purple or even black.

1. In the Explorer, under **Workspace**, click on **Terrain**.
