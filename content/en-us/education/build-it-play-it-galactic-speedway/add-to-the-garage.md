Remember how you flew a test speeder earlier? To fly your own speeder, it needs to be placed in the garage with the other vehicles.

1. Right-click on the driftspeeder. In the menu, select **Cut**. The speeder will disappear for now, but will reappear once you add it into the correct folder.

1. In the **Explorer** window, scroll to find a folder named **Garage**.
