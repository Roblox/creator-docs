Remember how you flew a test speeder earlier? To fly your own speeder, it needs to be placed in the garage with the other vehicles.

1. Right-click on the driftspeeder. In the menu, select **Cut**. The speeder will disappear for now, but will reappear once you add it into the correct folder.

2. In the **Explorer**, scroll to find a folder named **_Garage_**.

   <AlertTitle>Driftspeeder not appearing?</AlertTitle>
   To get your speeder back, use undo (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>) and repeat the process of **Cut** and **Paste Into**.
   </Alert>

4. Name your driftspeeder something descriptive like **_The Lightning_**. In the Explorer, right-click on **_Model_** and select **Rename**. Type the new name and then finish by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   <AlertTitle>Making changes after grouping</AlertTitle>
   To make changes to your speeder, just ungroup it and then make your changes. Group it all back together again when you're done.

   If you've added new parts, you'll have to move the model back to the garage:

   1. Ungroup and make changes.

      - In the game world right-click the driftspeeder and select **Ungroup**.
      - Make your changes.

   2. Group the parts back together.

      - Select all parts of the speeder.
      - Right-click anywhere in the game world and select **Group** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>).

   3. Place back into the Garage folder if necessary.

      - In the Explorer, make sure that your speeder is in the **Garage** folder. If not, move it back with **Cut** and **Paste Into**.
      - Name the driftspeeder by right-clicking on **Model** and selecting **Rename**.
