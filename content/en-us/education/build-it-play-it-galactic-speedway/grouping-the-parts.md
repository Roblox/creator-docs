The driftspeeder is almost complete! Everything just needs to be **grouped** into a single model. Once grouped, the code attached to the body will work for the entire speeder.

1. Before grouping, get a good view of your entire design by positioning your camera above it, then click and drag to select **only** the driftspeeder parts.

2. Right-click anywhere and select **Group** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>) to combine everything into one model.

3. Before moving on, double-check that everything is grouped by moving the driftspeeder. If any pieces were left behind, or you grouped objects not part of the speeder, undo the grouping (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>) and try again.
