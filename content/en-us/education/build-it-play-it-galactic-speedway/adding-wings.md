To work correctly in a race, the driftspeeder can only have one body. But, it can have as many wings and other parts as you'd like.

## Change snapping

Before adding wings, set **rotate snapping** to make it easier to position your wings. Snapping rotates parts a set amount a time.

1. Back in the **Home** tab, turn the **Rotate** snapping tool on.
1. Set it to `45`.

## Place the first wing

1. In the 3D viewport, click a wing from the second section of the scrapyard, then use the **Move** tool to drag it into the work area.

   Check in the **Home** tab that **Collisions** and **Move** snapping are turned off.

1. Back in the **Home** tab, select the **Rotate** tool, then drag the handles in the 3D viewport to rotate the wings. Each handle rotates in a different direction.

1. Back in the **Home** tab, select the **Scale** tool and drag the handles to scale the wings to a desired size.

1. If you want, use the **matching wing** in the scrapyard for the other side of the driftspeeder.

   <AlertTitle>Keep the driftspeeder in the work area</AlertTitle>
   Make sure the speeder can fit through the canyon while racing by keeping all of the parts within the blue lines.
