To work correctly in a race, the driftspeeder can only have one body. But, it can have as many wings and other parts as you'd like.

## Change snapping

Before adding wings, set **rotate snapping** to make it easier to position your wings. Snapping rotates parts a set amount a time.

1. In the **Model** tab, find the **Snap to Grid** section.
2. Make sure **Rotate** is checked.
3. Next to Rotate, type in 45. If it's already 45, go to the next step.

## Place the first wing

1. Click a wing from the second section of the scrapyard. Then, use the Move tool to drag it into the work area.

   Check in the **Model** tab that **Collisions** and **Move** snapping are turned off.
   </Alert>

2. To rotate the wing, select the **Rotate** tool and drag the handles. Each handle rotates in a different direction.

   To rotate an object 90 degrees, select that part and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>.
   </Alert>

3. To resize the wing, select the **Scale** tool and drag the handles to a desired size.

4. If you want, use the **matching wing** in the scrapyard for the other side of the driftspeeder.

   Make sure the speeder can fit through the canyon while racing by keeping all of the parts within the blue lines.
