Now that you've piloted a driftspeeder, it's time to design your own. The speeder will be built in three steps:

## Salvage parts

The scrapyard is divided into three sections, one for each step. By combining, rotating, and resizing these parts, you can create thousands of unique designs.

## Get ready to build

To move parts where you want them, first turn off **collisions** and **move snapping**. Turning off collisions allow objects to pass through one another. Having snapping off lets you freely move objects.

1. In the **Home** tab, click the **Geometric** button, then turn off **Collisions**.

1. Make sure the **Move** snapping tool is also turned **off**.

## Change the camera view

To work on the driftspeeder, use the camera controls below.

<table>
<thead>
   <tr>
     <th>Action</th>
     <th>Control</th>
   </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
   <tr>
     <td><b>Move</b></td>
     <td><kbd>W A S D</kbd></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><b>Rotate</b></td>
     <td>Hold the right mouse button and look around</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><b>Zoom</b></td>
     <td>Use the scroll wheel</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td><b>Focus</b></td>
     <td>Press <kbd>F</kbd> to focus the camera on a specific part</td>
   </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Move the camera so that you can better see the driftspeeder bodies and the work area at the same time.

If the camera doesn't move when you press <kbd>W A S D</kbd>, click somewhere inside the game world.
