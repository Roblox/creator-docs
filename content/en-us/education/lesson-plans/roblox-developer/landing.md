Teach how to code and create games for the Roblox platform - perfect for educators looking for an introductory course with multiple sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills in 3D modeling, coding, and design by creating an obstacle course and using code to add gameplay elements like traps. In the second half, they use those skills to create an adventure game where players explore, gather resources, and purchase items.

**Learning objectives and outcomes**

- Manipulate 3D parts and sculpt environments to create a virtual world.
- Experience the game design process by planning, designing, and playtesting a game.
- Create scripts for gameplay elements using concepts like if/then statements and variables.

**ISTE standards**: Empowered Learner 1d, Innovative Designer 4a, 4c, Creative Communicator 6b, 6c

<Alert severity="info">
This course is comprised of multiple lesson plans intended to be used over time. We estimate each lesson plan will be a full class day (45 minutes) for high school students.
