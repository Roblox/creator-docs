### Lesson plan

#### Introduction

1. Explain that today is an opportunity to catch up or further develop their game.
2. Regardless of what students work, will want to evaluate and redesign their game to meet specific goals:
   - **Fun** - players enjoy playing, want to keep playing
   - **Challenging** - players have a challenge but aren't punished or overly frustrated
   - **Error and glitch free** - no script errors, unusual looking parts/visuals, etc.

#### Guided tutorial - Get the game ready

1. Lead students through <a href="../../../education/adventure-game-series/finishing-the-project.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finishing the Project</a>.

- Playtesting is optional. Depending on your class, that time might be utilized for students to catch up on their projects.

#### Independent work

1. Have students either catch up on lessons or further develop their final projects.
   - As students work, their actions should help them meet the goals for today (fun, challenging, error-free).
2. If students feel finished, you can encourage them to:
   - Add additional items or upgrades.
   - Use the terrain tools to expand and improve their environment.
   - Add decorative parts that fit their environments theme.
   - Have a friend play their game and get feedback.

#### Wrap-up

1. Wrap up by leading a class discussion. Ask one of more of the below prompts.
   - One thing that was challenging but how they overcame it.
   - Something they're proud of in their game and why.
   - An example of how another student helped thi improve their game.
2. To showcase work, have students trade seats with a partner and let thi explore their world.
