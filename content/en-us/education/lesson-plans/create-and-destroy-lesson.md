### Introduction

1. Grab attention by showing the video in <a href="../../assets/education/lesson-plans/createAndDestroy-presentation.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Presentation: Create and Destroy</a> - Slide 2.
2. Explain students will use Roblox Studio to design the look of their own city using premade buildings and props. That city will be used in a game where players destroy buildings for the most points.

### Guided tutorial - Design a balanced map

1. Lead students through <a href="../../education/build-it-play-it-create-and-destroy/designing-a-map.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designing a Map</a>.

   - When publishing the game, save time by having students use placeholder titles and descriptions (My game, my description). Can always change later when finished.

### Guided tutorial - Build the city

1. To minimize troubleshooting, have students check the following before building:

   - Collisions are off.
   - Snap to Grid is on and set to 4 studs.
   - Using the View Selector, camera is set to the Top View.

2. Lead students through <a href="../../education/build-it-play-it-create-and-destroy/build-one-half.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build One Half</a>. Stop at Complete the City.
   - To ensure students finish, set strict limits on how many objects to place per section. For example: 3-5 large buildings, 8 medium buildings, 4 props.
   - Remind students to build on half of the map; will duplicate later to create a full map.

### Guided tutorial - Terrain tools

1. Lead students through <a href="../../education/build-it-play-it-create-and-destroy/terrain-tools.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrain Tools</a>.

### Independent work - Polish and publish

1. Lead students through <a href="../../education/build-it-play-it-create-and-destroy/change-the-script.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changing the Script</a>.
2. Have students catch up on their projects. If finished, can always add more buildings, roads, and props to their city.

### Wrap up

- Recap what students have created and vocabulary: level designer and script.
- Optional - To showcase work, have students trade seats with a partner and playtest their game.

## Appendix

### Troubleshooting tips

**Facilitation tips**

- If students are playtesting games together once publishing, set guidelines to ensure good sportsmanship. For example:
  - If you lose, don't make excuses. If you win, don't rub it in.
  - End with a handshake (or alternative action) and respect others.

**Timing notes**

- To ensure students finish their projects, set and enforce strict expectations on how many buildings or props they can place in a section. This helps students focus since they might get involved in building.

### Customize the lesson

**Simplify the lesson**

- Reduce the amount of recommended buildings, roads, and props. For example, instead of placing five buildings, add at most three.
- Adding Terrain can be an extension if students finish early.

**Expand the lesson**

- Have students create their own 3D models using parts. In the page, [Finish the challenge](../../education/build-it-play-it-create-and-destroy/finish-the-challenge.md), go to the section saying Custom Models and follow those instructions.

**Theme the lesson**

- This lesson can be easily customized for different social studies units. For example:
  - Create custom buildings inspired by the architecture of famous city.
  - Research the biome and climate of a city and replicate it in game.

### Miscellaneous resources

**Course description:**
Discover how to build the ultimate competitive multiplayer game using Roblox's free coding and design tools. In this unique course, students will be able to explore the basics of game design and 3D modeling, then share their completed game to play with friends online!

Created specifically for students new to game design, this curriculum is a great way for students to get started creating before moving onto more advanced projects and programming.

In this course, your student will:

- Design the city and environment for a multiplayer game
- Test, evaluate, and redesign to create a fun, polished game experience.
- Take home a complete game that can be played and shared online.
