### Lesson Plan

#### Introduction

1. Explain today's session will be different mini-projects to develop skills in scripting.

#### Guided tutorial - Work with properties

1. Lead students through the following tutorials:

   - [Object Properties](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-1/object-properties.md)
   - [Parents and Children](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-1/parents-and-children.md)

2. Encourage students to troubleshoot independently if they have an error. To help, have them try:
   - Redoing their last few steps.
   - Asking a peer for help.
3. As students write code, check that students write comments that accurately describe the code.
   - Not Specific: Runs code
   - Improved: Changes color of PracticePart

#### Guided tutorial - Code a trap

1. Lead students through the following tutorials:

   - [Code a function](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-2/coding-a-function.md)
   - [Intro to if statements](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-3/intro-to-if-statements.md)
   - [Traps with if statements](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-3/traps-with-if-statements.md)

2. When working with if statements, check that students indent code to look like code samples. This helps make the code more readable, which becomes important as scripts grow larger.

#### Wrap-up

1. Recap what students have created and vocabulary: **property**, **loop**, and **function**.

### Appendix

### Troubleshooting and classroom tips

- While coding, remind students to double-check their capitalization or ask a peer to check their work. Even one incorrect letter can cause an error in longer words like `FindFirstChildWhichIsA`.
- Try the following below to help students develop troubleshooting skills.
  - Purposely make a mistake in your code and ask students to identify the error. This can be easily turned into a game with students as you challenge them to find the error in a limited amount of time.
  - Write a partial line of code and ask students to complete it.
  - Utilize 'Ask 3 Before Me' where students ask three peers before asking the teacher for help. It's important for students to become comfortable independently troubleshooting as they advance to more complex projects.
