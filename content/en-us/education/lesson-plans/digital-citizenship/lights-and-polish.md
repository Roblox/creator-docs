### Introduction

1. Grab student attention by showing them some of the before/after pictures and videos on the <a href="../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post Processing Effects</a> page.
2. Outline the session.

   - Students will start by implementing feedback from the last session.
   - Next will be a brief lesson on how to add post-processing effects, a type of special effect. Rest of class time will be used on projects.

### Implement feedback

1. Remind students about giving each other feedback using the handout. They will now take time to make a change in their project based off the goal they wrote down in the previous session.
2. Help students 1 on 1 if they're reluctant to make changes on feedback. Remind them making changes can help their experience.

### Post processing effects

1. Before giving more work time, going to show students how to improve their projects's look and feel.
2. Point out students don't need to use their computers during this lesson, they just need to follow along with you.
3. Show students the different post processing effects available in <a href="../../../environment/post-processing-effects.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post Processing Effects</a>.

   - In this case, just show students where they can add an effect and explain each one. Students can independently explore each one in the next activity. Students don't need to directly follow along.

### Work on projects

1. Introduce Ask 3 Before Me - students ask 3 peers for help before asking the teacher. Call out this as an opportunity for digital citizenship and upstanding - if someone sees another struggling, ask if you can help.
2. Explain that students can use this time to either continue working on their obstacle course or to add special effects.

### Wrap up

1. Recap what students have created and vocabulary: **Post Processing Effect**.
2. To showcase work, have students trade seats with a partner and let them explore their world.
