### Introduction

1. Explain that today is an opportunity to catch up or further develop their project.
2. Regardless of what students work, will want to evaluate and redesign their game to meet specific goals:

   - **Fun** - players enjoy playing, want to keep playing.
   - **Challenging** - players are challenge but not punished or overly frustrated.
   - **Error-free** - no script errors, unusual looking parts/visuals, etc.

### Wrap up the project

1. Explain that students have this time to make improvements before getting feedback.

   - Emphasize that improvements should be small (e.g. tweaking a current part of the obstacle course rather than adding new parts).
   - If unclear what to work on, ask students to self-evaluate against the three goals (fun, challenging, errors) and look for something to improve.

### Wrap up and showcase

1. Wrap up by leading a class discussion. Ask one of more of the below prompts.

   - One thing that was challenging but how they overcame it.
   - Something they're proud of in their experience and why.
   - An example of how another student helped them improve their project.

2. Recap learning about digital citizenship and civility this week.

   - Ask a few ways students can practice being a digital citizen or stay safe. Some ideas: standing up if someone is being bullied, helping others, spotting unreliable information.

3. Showcase student work. Some options are below.

   - Students can make games public and then share links to peers to try out.
   - Select 2-3 student projects and play them as a class. Either have one student show their game at their computer, or you get a link to play a project at your computer.
