### Introduction

1. Outline the session.

   - Will first learn about digital citizenship and how to intervene in cyberbullying.
   - Rest of the time will be devoted to improving their projects, ending with a feedback opportunity where they'll get to player each other's experiences.

### Digital citizenship

1. Go through the lesson <a href="../../../education/resources/intro-to-digital-civility.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intro to Digital Civility</a>.
2. Guide students in an activity to practice upstanding.

   - Depending on your class, either do everything as a class or form small student groups (2-3 students).
   - Explain that students will hear different situations that they might see in an experience online. They'll listen and will practice a response.
   - Go through prompts in the Resource: Upstander Roleplay Situations and have students verbally roleplay their response.

### Work on projects

1. If needed, continue teaching any other lessons from the previous day.
2. Inform students they'll have this time to improve their projects.

   - While students work, encourage them to play-test (for at most one minute). Experiences should be challenging, but fun.

3. In the last five minutes, make sure students can play each other's projects.

   - If in person, they can just trade seats.
   - If remote, have students make their games public so others can play by sharing links.

### Project feedback

1. Open Presentation: Project Feedback and pass out Handout: Project Feedback to each student. This

   - Explain the process of playtesting and getting feedback in slides 2-3.
   - Connect to digital citizenship - ask students what are some ways they can practice being a good citizen while sharing and getting feedback (ex: Be open-minded with different experiences, don't pressure others to change their projects, etc).

2. Have students play each other's project for about five minutes, then write down feedback for their peer.
3. Reconvene as a class and have 2-3 students share a piece of feedback they received.
4. Have students reflect on making one change in their experience and write it down on the handout.

   - Will make that change tomorrow.
   - Have students pair up and share the change they'll make.

### Wrap up

1. Recap what students have created and the vocabulary term: **upstander**.
2. Have students connect giving feedback outside the classroom (online games, sports, talking with family). Remind that good online behavior is just like real life behavior. Ask these questions to start.

   - What are good or bad examples of giving someone feedback? Why?
   - What are good or bad examples of accepting feedback? How should you react or respond well when receiving feedback?
