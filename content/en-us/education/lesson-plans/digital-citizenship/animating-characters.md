### Introduction

1. Grab student attention by showing Presentation: Animations in Roblox - Slide 2.

   - Students will create their own animation that will be included in their obstacle course.
   - Ask students to verbally offer some animation ideas for their games (ex: flying, skipping, etc).

2. After creating an animation, will get feedback on their animation from a peer to help them improve it. Remind that this is another opportunity to practice civility both online and in-person.

### Plan an animation

1. Lead students through Presentation: Animations in Roblox - Slide 3-4.

   - As a class, have students brainstorm actions (ex: real life actions/sports like swimming or dancing, or fantastical like flying.
   - Have students create a goal for their animation (make a silly walk, create a cool superhero flying animation, etc). Goals will be used for the feedback activity.
   - Give students 2-4 minutes to decide on an animation and collect reference material (either images or have them act out motions in real life).

2. Recap by letting 2-3 students share their planned animation.

### Design an animation

1. Lead students through the following tutorial: <a href="../../../tutorials/curriculums/animator/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animation lesson</a>.

   - Note that this lesson uses a template which is not needed. Students will build this in their obstacle course experience.
   - Skip any pages referring to Challenge Checkpoints.
   - Slides are provided to help you throughout the tutorial.

### Add animations

1. Explain that students will use their exported animation as their players' walk
2. Use instructions in Presentation: Animations in Roblox - Slide 10 - 11.

   - Have students add the Animation Swap Script into their project, replace the animation ID in the script, and test to ensure their animation was replaced.

3. Ensure students have time to test out their animations.

   - If student animations aren't working, have them repeat the process.
   - For any students that are finished, have them help others.

### Feedback and redesign

1. Provide students the Handout: Animation Feedback.
   - Remind students about practicing civility in earlier sessions. Recap some guidelines if needed, or best practices in providing and receiving feedback.
2. Have students show an animation to another peer (either by switching seats or screen-sharing if remote). Peers will fill out the hand out to offer feedback and a recommendation.
3. When students have finished offering feedback, take a moment to discuss the value of feedback. Note they may not agree with feedback, but it's a valuable opportunity for them to grow.
4. Give students time to implement an idea they had after receiving feedback.

### Wrap up

1. Recap what students have created and vocabulary: animation and keypose.
2. Have students end the class by doing the pose they created in-game (if possible).
