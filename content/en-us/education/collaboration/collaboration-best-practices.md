Educators in both online and in-person classrooms find that using Roblox to collaborate in classrooms can be meaningful as well as educational. Based on the experiences of Roblox educators, here are some ways of fostering a collaborative atmosphere by setting clear expectations and using supportive strategies.

## Setting Classroom Expectations

Before starting a Roblox classroom, create guidelines like the ones below for students up-front. Encourage students to add on with their own suggestions.

### Classroom Guidelines

- **Build your own, don't copy.** If you do want to use someone's work, ask permission.
- **Respect the work of others.** Never vandalize or put down the work of others.
- **Solve problems together.** Assume the best of each other. Try and solve a conflict without teacher intervention.

### Conflict Resolution

Help students independently resolve conflict by modeling and teaching them the tips below.

- Encourage **"I" messages** _("I feel …")_ rather than **"you" messages**
  _("You did …")_. This helps both sides listen.
- Have students take turns speaking without interruption. If a student wants to interrupt, prompt them to take a deep breath or do a small private hand gesture (e.g. tap themselves on the thumb) to signal they should focus.
- When trying to find a resolution to a conflict, talk about interests and goals _("I feel this would look better blue")_, rather than positions _("You're wrong, blue is the best color …")_. Sharing interests and goals gives students something concrete to try resolving conflict.

## Collaboration Strategies

One way of creating a positive learning environment is to use strategies that foster collaboration. Below are strategies to meet specific goals you may have.

### Students Helping One Another

Strategies that encourage students to work together build independence and make collaboration feel more natural.

#### Help Students Help Themselves

- If students have a question, have them ask three peers before an instructor in a process often called **"Ask Three Before Me"**. During a class, remind students of this rule whenever they're asking you for help.

#### Reward Sharing

- Allow students to contribute by letting them lead **skill-shares**. If a student discovers something fun, or has a skill they want to share, give them 5-10 minutes during an independent work time to lead a tutorial. This encourages an atmosphere of sharing and rewards students for wanting to help others.

### Facilitating Groups

One way of having collaboration is often through group work. To ensure group work is productive and meaningful, we recommend the following strategies.

#### Assigning Roles

- Depending on the project, have students take on **roles** (either chosen or assigned). For instance, a team building a game may include a world builder and a coder. If you assign roles, be sure to rotate them so students learn new skills. They also might discover something they didn't expect to enjoy.

#### Having Groups Manage a "To-Do" List

- To ensure all group members are busy, have a group collectively manage a to-do list. If someone has an idea or task, they can add it onto the list for someone who needs something to work on.
