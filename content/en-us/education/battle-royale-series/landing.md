### Series Description

Create a round-based multiplayer experience where users compete to be the last player left! A great next lesson after the adventure game, this series expands on core concepts in game design and computer science. Once finished, the experience can be easily customized with unique gameplay elements and monetized.

### Objectives and Prerequisites

<table>
<tbody>
   <tr>
    <td width="20%"><b>Learning Objectives</b></td>
    <td>
    Practice <b>modular programming</b> by creating scripts that separately handle game functions, like teleporting players or starting a match timer.

    Implement <b>events</b> whenever game matches start and end to create cause and effect relationships between separate scripts.

    Implement <b>arrays</b> to manage players and manipulate them as needed as players start, win, or leave games.

    Understand the <b>coding architecture</b> of round based games, including how to cleanup and reset to making looping gameplay.
