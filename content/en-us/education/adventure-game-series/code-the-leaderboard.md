In-game, player will have important stats they need to see like the items they've collected. These numbers will be displayed using a leaderboard. **Leaderboards** are built-in features of Roblox that need a script to be activated and customized.

<Alert severity="info">
Note that the leaderboard in this experience doesn't save player information in-between sessions. For information on saving player data, you'll need to use an advanced coding concept called [data stores](../../cloud-services/datastores.md).

</Alert>

## Setting Up the Leaderboard

Whenever a player is added to the experience, they'll need to be added to the leaderboard along with code for tracking the individual stats.

1. In the Explorer, under **ServerScriptService**, create a new script named PlayerSetup. In that script, delete the hello world line and write a descriptive comment.

   <img src="../../assets/education/adventure-game-series/adventure_leaderboard_addtoServerScriptService.png"  />

2. After the comment, create a custom function named onPlayerJoin with a parameter named player.

   ```lua
   -- Creates a leaderboard that shows player variables

   local function onPlayerJoin(player)

   end
   ```

3. In `onPlayerJoin`, create a variable named `leaderstats`, and have it create a new **Folder** Instance.

   ```lua
   local function onPlayerJoin(player)
    local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
   end
   ```

4. Name the new **Folder** instance `leaderstats`, and parent it to the player. Naming the folder `leaderstats` lets Roblox Studio know to create a leaderboard.

   ```lua
   local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
      leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
      leaderstats.Parent = player
   end
   ```

    <Alert severity="warning">
    Because leaderboards are a built-in feature, they must be named exactly as seen. For example, a folder named "leaderboard" wouldn't work.
    </Alert>

5. After the end of the function, connect `OnPlayerJoin` to the `PlayerAdded` event. Whenever a player joins the experience, each player will be provided the leaderboard.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
      leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
      leaderstats.Parent = player
   end

   Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerJoin)
   ```

    <Alert severity="warning">
    Don't test yet since you won't see a leaderboard. Because there are no stats to display, the leaderboard won't appear.
    </Alert>

## Tracking Player Stats

Now that a leaderboard is created, it needs to show the player these numbers:

- **Gold** - How much money the player has.
- **Items** - How many items the player has collected from the world.
- **Spaces** - The most items a player can hold at one time.

Each of these numbers will be an IntValue, a placeholder object for a number.

### Coding Player Gold

Start with coding a stat for gold.

1. In `OnPlayerJoin`, under `leaderstats.Parent = player`, type `local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")`. This creates a new IntValue and stores it in the variable gold.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
      leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
      leaderstats.Parent = player

      local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")
    end
   ```

2. Next, type `gold.Name = "Gold"`. This gives the IntValue a name so you can use it in other scripts. The name will also be shown to players on the leaderboard.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")
      gold.Name = "Gold"
    end
   ```

    <Alert severity="warning">
    If you decide to use your own stat names, keep track of their exact name and spelling. They'll be referenced later in the series for other scripts.
    </Alert>

3. On a new line, type `gold.Value = 0`. This sets the starting value for players.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")
      gold.Name = "Gold"
      gold.Value = 0
    end
   ```

    <Alert severity="info">
    While variables are normally changed using `=` as in `myNumber = 10`, an IntValue is changed using `Value`, like `myIntValue.Value = 10`.
    </Alert>

4. Type `gold.Parent = leaderstats`. This parents the IntValue for gold to leaderstats. If the IntValue is not parented to leaderstats, players won't see it.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")
      gold.Name = "Gold"
      gold.Value = 0
      gold.Parent = leaderstats
    end
   ```

5. Play your project and notice that a leaderboard appears in the top right.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you don't see the leaderboard, try the following:

- Make sure that `.Value` is capitalized.
- Make sure that the variable for the IntValue is parented to the leaderboard like `gold.Parent = leaderstats`.

### Coding Items and Spaces

Remember that the stat names can be anything based off the game design document. In other words, `"Items"` can be `"Crystals"` instead.

1. Add a blank line to separate the next stat, then create the item stat by setting up a new IntValue the same way you did for gold.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      gold.Parent = leaderstats

      -- Create the Items stat
      local items = Instance.new("IntValue")
      items.Name = "Items"
      items.Value = 0
      items.Parent = leaderstats
    end
   ```

2. Create a new stat for the player's bag spaces. Set `spaces.Value` to `2` so players start the experience only being able to hold two items at once, encouraging them buy a new bag as soon as they can.

   ```lua
    local function onPlayerJoin(player)
      items.Parent = leaderstats

      -- Create the Spaces stat
      local spaces = Instance.new("IntValue")
      spaces.Name = "Spaces"
      spaces.Value = 2
      spaces.Parent = leaderstats
    end
   ```

3. Test the project. Players should have a leaderboard showing Gold, Items, and Spaces.
   <img src="../../assets/education/adventure-game-series/adventure-leaderboard-finished.jpg" width="70%" />

If the leaderboard doesn't appear, try checking the following below.

- If you can't see the number on the leaderboard, check that each IntValue is parented to leaderstats.
- Make sure each IntValue is spelled exactly as shown
- Check that the PlayerAdded event is at the bottom of the script

## Complete PlayerSetup Script

A finished version of the script can be referenced below.

```lua
 local Players = game:GetService("Players")

 -- Creates a leaderboard that shows player variables
 local function onPlayerJoin(player)
   local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
   leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
   leaderstats.Parent = player

   local gold = Instance.new("IntValue")
   gold.Name = "Gold"
   gold.Value = 0
   gold.Parent = leaderstats

   local items = Instance.new("IntValue")
   items.Name = "Items"
   items.Value = 0
   items.Parent = leaderstats

   local spaces = Instance.new("IntValue")
   spaces.Name = "Spaces"
   spaces.Value = 2
   spaces.Parent = leaderstats
 end

 -- Run onPlayerJoin when the PlayerAdded event fires
 Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(onPlayerJoin)
```
