For the next stage of the game loop, players need to sell their items for gold to allow them to purchase more space in their backpacks.

## Creating a Sell Platform

Players will sell their items by stepping onto a platform that gives them gold for each item in their bag.

### Setting up the Platform

The platform can be any part and will include a script that handles selling.

1. Create a new part named SellPlatform. Customize it to fit the theme of your experience.

2. In SellPlatform, create a new script named SellScript and add a comment.

   <img src="../../assets/education/adventure-game-series/adventure-showSellScript.png" />

3. In SellScript, type `local sellPart = script.Parent` to get the SellPlatform part.

   ```lua
   -- Sells all a player's items and gives them gold
   local sellPart = script.Parent
   ```

### Handling Touch Events

To use the platform, the script needs a function to check if any players touch it.

1. Create a function named `onTouch()` that checks if a player is touching the platform.

   ```lua
   local function onTouch(partTouched)
     local character = partTouched.Parent
   end
   ```

2. To change any of the stats on the leaderboard, the script needs to know what player is controlling the character. In the if statement, use the `GetPlayerFromCharacter()` function to find a player.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)
   ```

3. On the next line, get that player's leaderstats container.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)
   
   if player then
      -- Gets the player's leaderboard. Needed to get items and money
      local playerStats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
   end
   ```

4. On the next line, create variables to get the player's money and items.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)
   
   if player then
      -- Gets the player's leaderboard. Needed to get items and money
      local playerStats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")

      if playerStats then
         -- Gets the player's items and money
         local playerItems = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Items")
         local playerGold = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Gold")
      end
   end
   ```

   <Alert severity="warning">
   Make sure the names of everything in `FindFirstChild()` is exactly like the names written in the PlayerSetup script. For example, if your money is "Rubies" in PlayerSetup, playerGold should look for "Rubies" instead of "Gold".
   </Alert>

5. To check your work, add a print statement that will run if a player touched sellPart.

   ```lua
   local playerItems = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Items")
   local playerGold = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Gold")
   print("A player touched sellPart")
   ```

6. At the bottom of the script, connect the `onTouch()` to sellPart's Touched event.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local function onTouch (partTouched)
     local character = partTouched.Parent
     local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)
     if player then
       -- Gets the player's leaderboard. Needed to get items and money
       local playerStats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")
       
       if playerStats then
         -- Gets the player's items and money
         local playerItems = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Items")
         local playerGold = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Gold")

         print("A player touched sellPart")
       end
     end
   end

   sellPart.Touched:Connect(onTouch)
   ```

7. Play your project and step on sellPart; you should see the message `"A Player touched sellPart"` in the Output Window.

## Selling Items

In this experience, a player will get 100 Gold for each item. After getting money, their items will be set back to 0, letting players explore the world for more items.

### Coding a New Sell Function

1. Under the variables, create a function named `sellItems()` that gets two parameters named `playerItems` and `playerGold`.

   ```lua
   -- Sells all a player's items and gives them gold
   local sellPart = script.Parent

   local function sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)

   end

   local function onTouch(partTouched)
   ```

2. To give players the right amount of gold, take the value of the `playerItems` and multiply it by the amount of gold they should receive per item. This example gives one hundred gold pieces per item.

   In the `sellItems()` function, type `local totalSell = playerItems.Value * 100`

   ```lua
   local function sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)
     -- Gets how many items the player has and multiplies that by item worth.
     local totalSell = playerItems.Value * 100
   end
   ```

3. Type `playerGold.Value += totalSell` to add the gold for the items to their current gold.

   ```lua
   local function sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)
     local totalSell = playerItems.Value * 100
     -- Add how much the player earns to their money
     playerGold.Value += totalSell
   end
   ```

4. Type `playerItems.Value = 0`. This sets a player's items back to 0. If a player's items aren't set back to 0, the script will keep giving players gold without stopping.

   ```lua
   local function sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)
     local totalSell = playerItems.Value * 100
     playerGold.Value += totalSell
     playerItems.Value = 0
   end
   ```

5. In the `onTouch()` function, **under the second if statement**, call the `sellItems()` function. Pass in the parameters, `playerItems` and `playerGold` so they can be changed.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")

   local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)

   if player then
     -- Gets the player's leaderboard. Needed to get items and money
     local playerStats = player:FindFirstChild("leaderstats")

     if playerStats then
      -- Gets the player's items and money
      local playerItems = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Items")
      local playerGold = playerStats:FindFirstChild("Gold")

      if playerItems and playerGold then
         sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)
      end
     end
   end
   ```

6. Play your project; check that whenever a player steps on the platform, their gold increases and items are set to 0.

### Troubleshooting Tips

At this point, selling items doesn't work as intended, try one of the following below.

- `sellItems()` is called in the **second** if statement that checks the player's items.
- Any IntValue, like playerItems, uses .Value at the end if you're making a change to it. Value is always capitalized.
- `sellPart.Touched:Connect(onTouch)` is typed at the **bottom** of the script.
- `sellItems(playerItems, playerGold)` is typed before the end of the if humanoid then statement.
