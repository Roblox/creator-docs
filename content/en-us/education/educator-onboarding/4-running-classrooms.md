This module covers different aspects of running a class, like assessments and class management. Note that some parts may be more applicable based on your teaching situation.

By the end of this article, you will:

- Understand ways to assess or evaluate student progress.
- Recognize optional learning tools, such as Live Collaboration or Private Servers.
- Know where to find resources on digital civility and classroom management.

## Assessments and Evaluation

As an educator, there are different ways to gauge student progress and understanding. Options are included for those playing experiences and designing them.

### Assessing Virtual Learning Experiences

Roblox has built-in tools that allow anyone to screenshots or record video. These media artifacts can then be integrated into existing assignments. For example, a student may make recordings of a historical shrine as evidence in an Asian history assignment. To learn about these options, see <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314160-How-Do-I-Take-a-Screenshot-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taking a Screenshot</a> or <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203314190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recording Videos</a>.

Additionally, some virtual learning experiences may have built-in assessments, such as quizzes. Some lesson plans on Roblox Education also have reflection questions, handouts, or quizzes.

### Assessing Code and Creation

Projects created in Roblox Studio can be shared as local files or uploaded to the cloud. Uploading to the cloud allows projects to be shared through a hyperlink. An educator can then take that local file, or link, to evaluate a project. To view an example of how a Roblox Studio project can be evaluated, see the <a href="../../assets/education/legacy/Handout_-_Project_Rubric.pdf">Project-Based Rubric</a> handout.

### Quizzes and Rubrics

Examples of traditional quizzes and rubrics are included from sample lessons
below. Both are available to download and customize at the end of this course.

## Classroom Tools

To make learning and teaching easier, there are optional features in Roblox. For example, students can build collaboratively in Roblox Studio.

A quick summary of each tool and use cases are below.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<b><a href = "#roblox-chat">Roblox Chat</a></b>
</td>
<td>
Roblox offers multiple means of communicating on the platform, like experience-messaging and private messages.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b><a href = "#live-collaboration">Live Collaboration</a></b>
</td>
<td>
A tool in Roblox Studio that allows people to invite friends to collaborate on a project simultaneously with them.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b><a href = "#private-servers">Private Servers</a></b>
</td>
<td>
A closed server for experiences that allows you to control who can join.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b><a href="#groups">Groups</a></b>
</td>
<td>
Social networks with member lists and post boards. Also allows for collaboration opportunities.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Roblox Chat

Most Roblox experiences offer basic chat features.

<img src="../../assets/education/legacy/module4-showChat.jpg" width="80%" />

These features include:

- Being able to chat among all players in an experience server.
- Send private messages to a specific player.
- Mute/unmute specific players.
- Create groups for chat between specific players.

### Live Collaboration

**Live Collaboration** allows the owner of a project to invite friends to join them in
Roblox Studio to **collaboratively** build worlds or edit scripts together in
real-time. Multiple students can work together to design an environment or solve
a scripting exercise. This tool allows for shared projects or group-work in
Studio.

### Private Servers

Normally, whenever a player enters a Roblox experience, they're in a public server. If desired, educators can create private servers which allow for control over who may join. Invites to play can be sent with hyperlinks which can be shared through email or a learning management system (like Google Classroom).

</p>

### Groups

Groups are mini-communities that can be formed on the Roblox platform. Each group includes features like a member list with ranks and a "wall" to post announcements. For educators, groups can be used in classroom management posting links to experiences. Additionally, students can form their own groups as a way of collaboratively working on projects in Roblox Studio.

## Fostering a Positive Culture

Over the years, we've developed teacher-tested resources to help foster supportive learning environments. Practices such as digital civility better prepare students for the online world.

### Teaching Digital Civility

Digital civility is useful for all Roblox students. Our materials teach skills such as how to identify false or suspicious information, and how to treat others with kindness and respect.
