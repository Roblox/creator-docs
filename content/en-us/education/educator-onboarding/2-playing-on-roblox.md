Included in this training is creating an account and learning how to navigate within Roblox experiences. For the second part, there is the option of joining a training game specially created to familiarize you with Roblox mechanics.

By the end of this article, you will:

- Create and login into a Roblox account.
- Understand the layout of the Roblox platform and how to launch experiences.
- Learn basic skills in Roblox Client, such as avatar controls and camera manipulation.

## Creating Your Account

To play and create on Roblox, you need a **free** account.

### Account Creation

1. Create an account by signing up on the <a href="https://www.roblox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roblox Home Page</a>. Follow the prompts to create your account.

2. To create an account, you may be asked to complete a **CAPTCHA**. These are timed challenges used to discourage people creating fake accounts. Challenges vary, but often ask you to find a specific object in an image.

    <AlertTitle>CAPTCHAs and Students</AlertTitle>
    Note that your students may have to accomplish CAPTCHA challenges when logging
    into accounts. Because of this, we encourage setting aside time for account
    log-ins at the start of class.
    </Alert>

## The Roblox Home Page

Once you've logged in, you'll see the Roblox home page. This includes recommended games and navigation options. Additionally, you'll see your username and a headshot of your **avatar**, your virtual representation in Roblox.

  <AlertTitle>Customizing Avatars</AlertTitle>
Many users enjoy customizing their avatar, changing it to be a realistic
representation of themselves, or even becoming a fantasy character. Avatars are
customized using avatar items in the <a

target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketplace</a>.
</Alert>

Before moving onto the training experience, it's recommended you add an email to your account. This adds extra security to your account and ensures you don't get locked out if a password is forgotten.

1. On the Roblox home page, in the top right, click the <img

   width="22" /> and select **Settings**.

2. On your account screen, click **Add Email**. Type in your school or
   organization email. Follow prompts as needed to verify the email.

## Learn Roblox Client

With an account created, you'll now launch your first Roblox experience. The **What is Roblox? - Training Experience** is designed by the Roblox team to introduce educators how to play Roblox and feel comfortable on the platform.

Alternatively, you can view the <a href="../../assets/education/legacy/Handout_-_Roblox_Client_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf">Roblox Platform Quick Start Guide</a>, a handout summarizing the interface and controls instead of joining the experience.

### Experience Pages

All Roblox experiences have their own page. This page includes a description and button used to open that specific experience in Roblox Client.

A sample page is below.

### Launch the Experience

1. To start, go to the [What is Roblox? Training Experience](https://www.roblox.com/games/7086173721).

2. On that page, click the **Play** button. If you already have Roblox installed, it'll open the experience. If not, permit Roblox to be installed onto your device.

3. With Roblox Client open, go through the experience as instructed. This should take about 5 - 10 minutes. Come back to your web browser when you see a sign reading "You Finished the Training!"
