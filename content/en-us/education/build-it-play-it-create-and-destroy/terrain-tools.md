The **Terrain Editor** is used to sculpt natural features. To start, you'll shape the shape of the island, then get into details such as mountains and painting the landscape.

## Create the Shape

1. In the Terrain Editor window, select the **Edit** tab. Then, click the **Add** tool.

2. **Add** creates land wherever you click or drag the blue cursor. Change the **Base Size** or **Shape** to give you more control over the tool.

3. Click and drag the blue cursor to create a natural island shape. Cover the hard edges of the square building area, and try to get rid of any straight lines. If you don't like the results, press <kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜ + Z</kbd>.

## Adding Details

Right now, the island may look a bit jagged. Next, you'll smooth out the terrain and fine-tune it with the Subtract and Paint tools.

1. Select the **Smooth** tool. This will average out the highs and lows of terrain. Drag it around to make areas look more natural.

    <Alert severity="warning">
    To better see what your terrain looks like, remember to rotate your camera and see terrain from multiple angles, not just always from the top.
    </Alert>

2. Remove unwanted terrain with the **Subtract** tool. This can be useful to quickly delete terrain that's overtaken the city.

3. **Paint** sand and mud on the edges to create beaches. Paint changes the texture without changing the shape.
