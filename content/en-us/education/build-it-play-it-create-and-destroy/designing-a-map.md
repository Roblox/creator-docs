Most popular experiences are made by teams of people with different skills working together. One role on teams is the **level designer**, a common career in game development.

Level designers shape the game environment, painting terrain, placing props, and adding buildings. In competitive experiences, they make sure maps are balanced and fair for all players. For this challenge, you'll become a level designer and turn a blank starter map into a city ripe for destruction.

## Symmetrical map design

One technique used by level designers to ensure multiplayer maps are fair is by building half the map, and then duplicating and rotating it to create the second half. This is called symmetrical design since it divides the map into two equal halves.

Notice in the video below how one half of the city is copied to create full map.

## About the template

In this template, a prop artist and a coder have already created a starter map, you just need to design the city. On the left is an island, and on the right is a palette of objects to use. This sort of setup is very common in game development.
