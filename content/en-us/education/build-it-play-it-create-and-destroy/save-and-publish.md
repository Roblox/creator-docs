It's important to save the whole project by **publishing** it to Roblox. It's a good idea to publish every ten minutes while you're working or after making a big change.

1. Select **File** → **Publish** to Roblox to open the publishing window.

2. Enter a place name and an optional description.

3. When ready, click the **Create** button.
