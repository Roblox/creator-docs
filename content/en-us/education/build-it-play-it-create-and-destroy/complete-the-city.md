When the first half of the city is ready, the next step is to use duplicate to turn it into a complete 4-player map. Even after you've duplicated the first half, you can still keep making changes to the city.

1. In the Model tab, **collisions** should be **off** (not highlighted). Collisions will make the map difficult to move and rotate.

2. Click and drag your mouse to **select all** the buildings, roads, and props.

3. **Duplicate** the selection just like you have before.
4. Use the **Move** and **Rotate** tools to reposition your city. If it doesn't look right, just undo (<kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜ + Z</kbd>) and try again.

After duplicating and rotating the city, you can add or adjust tiles to make the halves fit together better.
