Next, duplicate the road tiles in your palette to create roads between the buildings. As you place them, you'll need to rotate them into the correct position.

1. Select a road in the palette and **duplicate** it. Then, **move** it over into your map.
2. Rotate the selected road tile to get the desired orientation. To rotate the tiles, select the **Rotate** tool and drag the green handle until the tile rotates.

  <Alert severity="info">
  You can save time building roads by duplicating a road tile in your arena, rather than always duplicating from the palette.
  </Alert>

## Map example

Leave plenty of room for the other buildings and decorations.
