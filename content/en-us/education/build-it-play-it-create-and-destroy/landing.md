A finished version of the experience is available at the <a href='https://www.roblox.com/games/7290548674/Create-and-Destroy-Test-Map?'>Create and Destroy Test Map</a>. If you don't have Roblox installed, you can do so by playing the test map.
</Alert>

## Download Roblox Studio

You'll need Roblox Studio, which is used to create every experience on the Roblox platform and is available free for **PC** and **Mac**. We strongly recommend using a 3-button mouse with a scroll-wheel for navigating in 3D space.

1. Go to the Create page and click the Start Creating button to download Studio.
2. After installing, double-click the desktop icon (Windows) or click the dock icon (Mac).
3. On the login screen, enter your Roblox username and password, then click Log In.

<Alert severity="info">
If you're new to Roblox and are <a href="https://www.roblox.com/home">signing up</a> for the first time, remember these safety tips:

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** — If your username is "bloxdev," your password should not be "bloxdev123."
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** — Report anyone who asks using the Report Abuse feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** — Never trust players or sites who say they have a secret way to get free Robux!
