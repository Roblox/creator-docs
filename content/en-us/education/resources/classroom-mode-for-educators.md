Classroom Mode is an optional feature found in select Roblox experiences. This includes a set of **classroom management** tools for educators like controlling chat, or letting students raise hands to signal a teacher. When a verified educator joins an experience with Classroom Mode enabled, they'll see the teacher view, while everyone else will see a student view.

## Get started

To use Classroom Mode, you'll first need to become a verified educator and find an experience with the feature enabled.

### Become a verified educator

The Verified Educator system will be launched on Q4 2022.

### Open an experience

After becoming a verified educator, you'll be able to use Classroom Mode. This feature is found in select experiences where you are running a <a href="../../education/support/private-servers-for-classroom-use.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private server</a>.

1. Find an experience in the **Classroom Collection**, page with curated educational experiences with Classroom Mode enabled.

   <Alert variant="standard" severity="info" >
   The Classroom Collection will be released in Q1 2022, along with Classroom Mode.
   </Alert>

2. On that experience's webpage, create a <a href="../../education/support/private-servers-for-classroom-use.md">private server</a>. This can be done on that page by going to **Servers** > **Create Private Server**.

3. Join the private server for the experience. In Roblox, look for the **Dashboard** icon, normally in the bottom left. Clicking this will open and close your tools, which are covered in the next section.

    <Alert variant="standard" severity="info" >
      Because individual developers are responsible for how they want to implement
      Classroom Mode, there might be <strong>slight differences</strong> between
      experiences. For example, the button to open the dashboard may be in a different
      place.
    </Alert>

## Features and tools

The dashboard organizes features into three total tabs: **Students**, **Tools**, and **Announcement**. Each tab includes it's own tools.

### Student roster

The roster displays students currently in the experience, listing their Roblox username.

![](../../assets/education/legacy/cm-educator-studentRoster.jpg)

<Alert variant="standard" severity="info" >
  A student's display name may be different than their user name. A user name is permanent identifier for an account, while a student may change their display name as desired. For more information, see <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401938870292-Changing-Your-Display-Name">Display Names</a>
</Alert>

#### Raise hands

Next to the user's name is a button that indicates if they're raising their hand. How this feature is used is up to the educator. Students can raise their hand to respond to a question, or indicate they need technical help.

#### Teleport to a student

Teleporting can be used to check on students or see their surroundings to better
respond to a question. To do so, click on the icon by their name.

### Announcements

Customizable announcements can be used to present questions or point out timing to students. Note that only one announcement can be displayed at a time.

1. In the **Announcement** tab, click on the input box and type in the announcement.

2. Click the **Create** button.

3. Announcements may appear in the top center. Both the educator and students see the same announcement.

4. Remember, only one message can be displayed at a time. To remove a message for you and all students, click the **Clear** button.

### Student features

Students sharing an experience with an educator will get their own set of tools. Currently, we just support a toggle button to raise or lower a hand to get an educator's attention.

## Support

If you encounter any issues, please contact us at [education@roblox.com](mailto:education@roblox.com) so we can address it. Some possible issues may be:

- A feature doesn't work as advertised on this documentation.
- An experience doesn't include Classroom Mode.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is Classroom Mode in every Roblox Experience?**

Because developers choose to include Classroom Mode, it's not found in every
experience.

**What does it mean to become a verified educator?**

To become verified, educators will have to submit information (such as an email
address and LinkedIn profile). Roblox will then verify your information and
provide you access to Classroom Mode.

**Can students use or abuse Classroom Mode?**

No, because only verified educators can use this mode, we don't permit students
access to this feature.
