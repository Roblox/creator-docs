Roblox experiences transport students through space and time into virtual worlds designed for exploration, investigation, and experimentation. Students can witness and dissect scientific phenomena, see what it was like to live in ancient Rome, or even build virtual robots.

This section helps developers understand what they can design on Roblox. See the <a href="https://education.roblox.com/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Partners</a> page to learn more about leveraging the Roblox platform for educational purposes.

### Inspiration for developers

Designers looking for ideas for educational experience can find a variety of topics and example mechanics in live experiences to explore on Roblox within the Inspiration Guide.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I contract Roblox to develop a project?**

Roblox doesn't actually develop experiences. Every experience on the platform is created by the Roblox community. If development assistance is needed, explore the <a href="https://talent.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talent Hub</a> as a means of finding potential developers, coders, and creators.

**How do educational experiences monetize?**

Developers have a variety of options for monetizing an educational experience. Traditional monetization still applies for developers interested in pursuing informal learning, such as "edutainment" experiences.

For developers interested in creating for schools, note that monetization is prohibited during school hours. Such developers can pursue alternatives to traditional monetization, such as offering teacher training and lesson resources outside of the Roblox platform.
