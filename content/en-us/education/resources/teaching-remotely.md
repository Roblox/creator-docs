## Tips to teaching remotely

Teaching with Roblox introduces unique opportunities. When running a remote classroom, keep in mind the following tips:

- **Set Expectations Early** - Whether it's how students interact together, or taking turns building a collaborative project, set expectations before starting a lesson. Encourage students to create expectations with you for greater buy-in. For example, expectations like "Don't change someone's work without permission", can make collaborative building fun and easier.
- **Prep Log-in Practices** - Depending on your classroom, students may need up to 3-5 minutes to login. Additionally, come up with a system so students track their own Roblox usernames and passwords.
