**Congratulations**, you just finished the latest Roblox Creator Challenge!

Now that you've completed the game, here are a few ideas to take your game further and keep learning.

## Share your experience

One of the most exciting features of Roblox is that it's really easy to share your game with friends. Currently your game is probably private, meaning only you can play it. For your friends to see the game, you need to make it public.

1. Select **File** (top left of Studio) and click **Game Settings**.

## Add more to the story

Although you completed the challenge, there's always more that you can add into the story.

Here are a few ideas:

**Add More Characters** – Think of one or two more characters in your story. Remember to create a new variable for each character, like name2 or name3.

**Add More Lines** – Write down a new sentence for your story and pick an object you can replace.
