With the story created, it's time to turn that vision into code using Roblox.

## Start Roblox Studio

The experience will be created using **Roblox Studio**. It's free to use and can instantly publish games to iPhone, Android, Xbox Live, PC, Mac, and VR.

1. Open **Roblox Studio** by double-clicking the it's icon on the desktop (Windows) or clicking the dock icon (Mac).
2. On the login screen, enter your Roblox username and password, then click Log In.

## Open the template

A template has been created that has everything needed for the experience to work, except the code for the actual story. Templates are pre-made worlds that you can use as a base for your own experiences.

1. Download the template.

   <Button variant="contained">Download Template</Button>
   </a>

2. In Roblox Studio, in the top left, click **File** &rarr; **Open from File** and select the downloaded file.

## Close extra windows

The first time you launch Roblox Studio, extra windows might open up that you don't need right now. Closing the extra windows will give you more space to see what you're doing.

1. Close each window on the **left** of the 3D view by clicking the **&times;** in the window's upper-right corner. If you don't see anything to close on the left, go to the next step.

2. Leave the **Explorer** and **Properties** windows open on the right side of Studio.
