This is a good point at which to check your code and make sure it runs. Testing your code often makes it easier to figure out where you might have made a mistake.

1. Test your by code by clicking the **Play** button.

2. Walk up to the pedestal using <kbd>W A S D</kbd> on your keyboard and press <kbd>E</kbd>.

   <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Control</th>
        <th>Action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><kbd>W</kbd></td>
        <td>Moves the camera forward.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><kbd>S</kbd></td>
        <td>Moves the camera back.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><kbd>A</kbd></td>
        <td>Moves the camera left.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><kbd>D</kbd></td>
        <td>Moves the camera right.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><kbd>Spacebar</kbd></td>
        <td>Your playable character jumps.</td>
      </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Hold and drag the <kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd></td>
        <td>Moves the camera view around.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>

3. Check to see if your question is displayed. **Don't** try to answer the question or click the "Submit" button. The code for that isn't made yet.

## Save your code

It's important to save the whole project by **publishing** it to Roblox. It's a good idea to publish every ten minutes while you're working or after making a big change.

1. Select File â†’ Publish to Roblox to open the publishing window.
