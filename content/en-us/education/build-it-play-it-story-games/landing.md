In Roblox Story Games, words are going missing and it's up to players to fill in the blanks! Participate in the **Hour of Code**™ by coding your own story game using Roblox's free coding and design tools. Prove your coding knowledge to earn exclusive badges and avatar items.

Play the video below to see the library you'll be working in and the game in action.

### Your coding journey

You'll create your story game by going through three different lessons. Each lesson will have instructions teaching you how to code your game from start to finish.

After finishing a lesson, you'll get the chance to earn prizes by playing a quiz game on Roblox. After earning the prize, come back and continue the next lesson.

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** — If your username is "bloxdev," your password should not be "bloxdev123."
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** — Report anyone who asks using the Report Abuse feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** — Never trust players or sites who say they have a secret way to get free Robux!
