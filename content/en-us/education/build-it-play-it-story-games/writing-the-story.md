## Brainstorm ideas

Before coding, write the story you'll use as the base of your game. The story can be about anything you wish.

To start, on a piece of paper or using a text editor, **write 2-3 sentences** for the opening paragraph. Here's a few story ideas to get you started:

- Your dream vacation
- What a wizard eats for breakfast
- A superhero's shopping trip

An example story is below:

_In a tree on a hill lives the great wizard Nia. Every morning, the wizard loves eating a giant bowl of honey roasted lizard leaf._

## Create placeholders

With an idea for a story, you can start the process of turning it into a game.

Remember, in your experience, players will type in words that **replace** key parts of your story. For this step, you'll find parts of the story that can be **placeholders**, where a player can add in their own input.

1. In the first sentence, pick a single word to be replaced by the player such as a name, action, or a noun. In this example, we'll select the wizard's name.

   _In a tree on a hill lives the great wizard **Nia**._

2. Replace the word with a placeholder for what type of word you'll ask the player for. Since you might end up asking the player for more than one noun or adjective, number the playerholder.

   _In a tree on a hill lives the great wizard **name1**._

With the sentence created, it's time to turn it into code!
