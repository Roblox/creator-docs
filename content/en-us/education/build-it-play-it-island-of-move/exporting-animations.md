You have an animation but now it needs to go into your game. To use the animation, it will need to be exported from the animation editor to the Roblox platform.

1. In the Animation Editor, click on the **...** and select **Export**.

## Get the animation ID

An animation ID lets the game know what animation to play. You'll use the ID of your exported animation for players in your game.

1. Once the animation is exported, **copy** the ID by clicking the <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-island-of-move/exporting-animations/copy-icon.png" width="14px" /> icon. You should see a green "**_ID Copied!_**" text.
