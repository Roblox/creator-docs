You have an animation but now it needs to go into your game. To use the animation, it will need to be exported from the animation editor to the Roblox platform.

1. In the **Animation Editor**, click on the **...** and select **Publish to Roblox**. The **Asset Configuration** window displays.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   <AlertTitle>Animation Editor Blank?</AlertTitle>
   If you closed Studio, the Animation Editor may be blank or closed.

   - To open the **Animation Editor**, go back to the **Avatar** tab, then select the **Animation** button.
   - If the Animation Editor is blank, reselect the Figure on the pedestal.

    </Alert>

2. In the window, give the animation a **name** and **description**.

3. Click the **Submit** button.

## Get the animation ID

An animation ID lets the game know what animation to play. You'll use the ID of your exported animation for players in your game.

1. Once the animation is exported, **copy** the ID by clicking the icon next to the ID. You should see a green "**ID Copied!_**" text.
