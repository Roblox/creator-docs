The template has a pre-built setting for what animation to use when players run. To change the animation, you'll need to replace the default animation with yours.

## Change the animation ID

Now that you have the animation ID, you can enter it in your game. Then, Studio will know what animation to play.

1. Make sure the **Explorer** and **Properties** windows are open.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   If you don't see the windows on the right, enable them by going to the **Home** tab and clicking the **Explorer** and **Properties** buttons.

   If nothing was pasted, or another line of text was used, you'll need to get the animation ID again.

   1. Go to the [Creator Dashboard](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations)/
   1. In the horizontal navigation, select **Development Items**, then click the **Animations** button. All animations you have ever published display here.

   1. Select your animation. The animation's **Configure** page displays.
   1. In the left-hand navigation, click the vertical three dots icon, then select ** Copy Asset ID** from the contextual menu.

## Troubleshooting tips

**Issue:** Animation is spotty, skips, or looks glitchy.

- Make sure that the first and last poses are the same. Right-click on the diamond for the first pose and copy it. Then, paste that pose at the end of the timeline.
- Check that the figure stays inside the white grid when selected. If not, it may go through walls or the ground.

**Issue:** Animation isn't the one that you were working on.

- Check that you've published the animation through the Animation Editor.

- Find in the Explorer an object named WalkAnimationID. Make sure its Value is only a number.
