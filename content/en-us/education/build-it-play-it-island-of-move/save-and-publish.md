## Save the place

The animation is saved, but it's important to save the whole project by publishing it to Roblox. It's a good idea to **publish** every ten minutes while you're working or after making a big change.

1. Select **File** → **Publish to Roblox** to open the publishing window.

2. Enter a place name and an optional description.

3. When ready, click the **Create** button. Once published, games can be edited from any computer since they're connected to your account.
