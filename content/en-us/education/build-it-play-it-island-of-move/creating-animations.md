Creating animations is like posing an action figure. For this tutorial, you'll create two poses. When the game runs, Roblox Studio will connect the poses together to create an animation.

## Set up the Animation Editor

The poses and the final animation will be created using the Animation Editor.

1. To find the Animation Editor, go to the **Avatar** tab, then click the **Animation** button.

   The Animation Editor will open at the bottom of your screen.

2. Next, you need a character to animate. On the pedestal, one has already been set up for you. Select the **figure** on top.

   The part names that make up the figure will appear in the animation editor.

## Prepare to pose

Before creating the poses, make it easier to pose figures by changing a program setting and then position the camera.

1. Back in the **Avatar** tab, find the snapping tools and make sure **Rotate** and **Move** are not checked.

2. Using the camera controls, move the camera to get a good view of the part you want to animate. When moving, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to slow down camera movements.
