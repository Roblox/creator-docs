Before animating, test out the template to see how the game works. In-game, players make progress around the track by clicking the move button, or using a mobile device and moving around in real-life. Players start off slow and then get faster and faster.

1. Click **Play** to test.

2. In the experience, walk up to the golem character on the stage and press <kbd>E</kbd> to open up a menu. On that screen, click **Play Game**.

3. Once in-game, go forward by repeatedly clicking the **Move** button. Your character will automatically follow the track as you click.
