Start by creating the first pose of your animation. This tutorial shows a swimming animation, but yours can be whatever you envision. Depending on the animation you want to create, your first pose may be very different.

## Pose the figure

Posing figures is done by rotating individual parts and joints, like the head or elbow.

1. To rotate, click on a body part. A set of handles will appear.

   <Alert severity="warning">
   **Troubleshooting Rotation**

   - **Issue:** Can't click on Rotation Handles
     Another part may be blocking your click. Try rotating around your camera until you see a blue box whenever you hover over the part you want to click.

   - **Issue:** Can't See Rotation Handles
     If you see a set of arrows instead of the circles, you'll need to turn the **Rotate** tool on by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.

    </Alert>

2. Rotate by **dragging** the handles. Each handle rotates in a different direction. **Undo** any change with (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd>).

3. Continue to rotate different parts until the first pose is complete. While working, change the camera to see the pose from multiple angles.
