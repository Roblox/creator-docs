Moving is always more fun with friends, so let's set up your game for others can play. When a game is first published, it's automatically set to private. Set it instead to public so others can join.

1. **Publish** your game so your friends will get your latest changes.

1. Select **File** &rarr; **Game Settings** to open the **Game Settings** window.

1. On the left bar, select **Permissions**, then choose **Public**.
