Moving is always more fun with friends, so let's set up your game for others can play. When a game is first published, it's automatically set to private. Set it instead to public so others can join.

1. **Publish** your game so your friends will get your latest changes.

2. In the **Home** tab, click **Game Settings**.

3. On the left bar, select **Permissions**.

4. Choose **Public**.
