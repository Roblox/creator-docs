Create new buildings or expand the current ruins with this kit of extra parts. Once you finish designing a more visually impressive world, get a new avatar item.

## Add to your inventory

Get extra parts to work with by importing an asset. **Assets** are parts of a Roblox game, like a 3D model or sound, that are stored online.

1. Open the link to the kit below in your web browser.

   <Button variant="contained">Extra Props</Button>
   </a>

2. On the page for the asset, click the **Get** button to add it into your inventory.

All assets can be found in your **Inventory**. This stores any models you've added and lets you add them into a game.

1. In Roblox Studio, find the Toolbox. If it's not open, go to the **View** tab and click the **Toolbox** button.
