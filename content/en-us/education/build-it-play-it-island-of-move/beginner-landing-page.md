Welcome to the **Island of Move**, an ancient, far-away land where Roblox players are always in motion. Using Roblox Studio, learn how to create your own simulator game where people move to gain points. The way players move will be up to you, whether it's swimming through the air or dancing along the track.

After completing this **Build It, Play It** challenge, you'll have a finished game to share with friends. Players can even join on a mobile device and gain points by walking and moving in real-life.

Now, time to get moving!

## Download Roblox Studio

To start, you'll need **Roblox Studio**. This program is used to create every game on Roblox and is available free for **PC** and **Mac**. If you've played Roblox games on your computer, you already have Studio installed. While creating, we strongly recommend using a **2-button mouse** with a **scroll wheel**.

<Alert severity="info">
<AlertTitle>Create a New Account and Get Studio</AlertTitle>
If you're completely new to Roblox, follow these instructions to get started:

1. [Sign up for an account](https://www.roblox.com/account/signupredir).
2. [Download Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create).
3. After installing, double-click the Roblox Studio desktop icon (Windows) or click the dock icon (Mac).
4. On the login screen, enter your Roblox username and password, then click **Log In**.

With your new account, remember these safety tips:

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** — If your username is "bloxcool," your password should not be "bloxcool123."
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** — Report anyone who asks using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203312410) feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** — Never trust players or sites who say they have a way to get free Robux!
