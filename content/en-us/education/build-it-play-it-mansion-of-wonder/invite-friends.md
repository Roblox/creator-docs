Adventuring is always more fun with friends, so let's set up your experience for others can play. When an experience is first published, it's automatically set to private. Set it instead to public so others can join.

1. **Publish** your experience so your friends will get your latest changes. Remember you can publish by going to the File menu in the top left.

2. Select **File** (top left of Studio) and click **Game Settings**.

3. On the left bar, select **Permissions**, then choose **Public**.
