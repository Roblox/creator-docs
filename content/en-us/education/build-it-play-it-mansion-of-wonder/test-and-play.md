To see how the carnival ride works, test it out. When playing, you'll ride on a cart and blast away approaching enemies. Just make sure no enemies touch the ride - too many hits from an enemy and the cart will explode!

1. Click **Play** to test.

2. In the experience, walk up to the character under the **Play It** sign and press <kbd>E</kbd> to open up a menu. On that screen, click **Join Game**.

3. When the ride starts, left click to shoot the blaster at enemies. Watch the cart's **health** at the top of the screen and try and make it to the treasure room at the end.
