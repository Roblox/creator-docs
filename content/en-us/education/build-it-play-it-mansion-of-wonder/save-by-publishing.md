Before moving to the next section, take a moment to save the project. It's important to save the whole project by publishing it to Roblox. **Publishing** just saves your project to your Roblox account, it doesn't make it public yet. It's a good idea to publish every ten minutes while you're working or after making a big change.

1. Select **File** (top left of Studio) and click **Publish to Roblox** to open the publishing window.

   If the Publish button is grayed out, make sure you've **stopped** the playtest.

2. Enter a **name** for your experience and an optional **description**.

3. When you're happy with the name and description of your project (you can always go back and change it), click the **Create** button. Once published, a project can be edited from any computer since all published projects connected to your account.
