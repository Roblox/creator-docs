Before moving to the next section, take a moment to save the project. It's important to save the whole project by publishing it to Roblox. **Publishing** just saves your project to your Roblox account, it doesn't make it public yet. It's a good idea to publish every ten minutes while you're working or after making a big change.

1. Select **File** (top left of Studio) and click **Publish to Roblox** to open the publishing window.

2. Enter a **name** for your experience and an optional **description**.

3. When you're happy with the name and description of your project (you can always go back and change it), click the **Create** button. Once published, a project can be edited from any computer since all published projects connected to your account.

   <Alert severity="info">
   Next time you want to save your work, just go to **File** ⟩ **Publish to Roblox** or use the hotkey combo (<kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>).
