Create your own Roblox experience by customizing elements of the **Mansion of Wonder** template in Roblox Studio! Design and personalize the magic blasts that you and your friends will use to defeat sinister slimes and ghastly ghosts as you ride through a spooky carnival experience.

Will you conquer these creatures with bolts of lightning or piles of angry cats? Only you get to decide: you build it, then play it!

## Download Roblox Studio

Before starting, you'll need **Roblox Studio**. This program is used to create every experience on Roblox and is available for free on a **PC** or **Mac**. If you've played Roblox on your computer, you already have Studio installed. When using Studio, we recommend using a **mouse** if you have one.

If you already have a Roblox account, skip to the next <a href="../../education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/beginner-landing-page.md#series-overview">section</a>.

1. [Sign up for an account](https://www.roblox.com/account/signupredir).

2. [Download Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create).

3. After installing, double-click the Roblox Studio desktop icon (Windows) or click the dock icon (Mac).

4. On the login screen, enter your Roblox username and password, then click **Log In**.

With your new account, remember these safety tips:

- **Never share your password**, even with a real life friend.
- **Make your password hard to guess** — If your username is "bloxcool," your password should not be "bloxcool123."
- **Roblox employees will never ask for your password** — Report anyone who asks using the [Report Abuse](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203312410) feature.
- **There's no such thing as free Robux** — Never trust players or sites who say they have a way to get free Robux!

## Series overview

To design your personalized **magic blast**, follow along with these three step-by-step tutorials.

After each lesson, there's a special code that can be redeemed for a **free** virtual Roblox **avatar item**. Once you've completed all the lessons, you'll have a Roblox experience to play with friends and some cool swag to show off.
