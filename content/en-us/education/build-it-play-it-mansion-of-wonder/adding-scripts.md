description: Learn how to use Lua code to manipulate beams and emitters to add tutorial mechanics to your game in the Roblox Build It Play It Mansion of Wonder.
---

Time to bring all this work together! Now that you've created the beam and particle components, you'll add in three premade scripts. These scripts manage the tutorial by telling components when to do what. For example, the scripts will create beams for new players and emit particles whenever they interact with goals.

<Alert severity="info">
While you can follow all these steps even if you haven't coded before, having that knowledge can help you adapt these scripts for your own experience. To learn more, see the [Coding Fundamentals](../../tutorials/fundamentals/coding-1/coding-fundamentals.md) tutorial.

</Alert>

## Storing Beam and Particles

Before adding the scripts, the beam and particles need to be moved to where the scripts will be able to make copies of them as needed.

<Alert severity="warning">
If you're using your own project, you may need to replace the values within some scripted variables to match your objects.
</Alert>

1. In **ReplicatedStorage**, create a new folder named **PlayerTutorial**. Move TutorialBeam out of TestPlayer, and into the new folder.

   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/move-tutorial-beam.png"  />

2. In **ServerStorage**, create a folder named **TutorialParticles**. Move the **Burst** particle out of TestPlayer into that folder.

   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/create-particles-folder.png"  />

3. Once the beam and particle emitter are moved, you no longer need the TestPlayer. **Delete** TestPlayer since the script will work with real players when finished.

## Creating Events

Each time players interact with a goal, the tutorial script will need to know so it can update that player's progress and emit the particle effect. To inform scripts, signals can be sent using **events**.

1. In ReplicatedStorage > PlayerTutorial, create two **RemoteEvent** objects. Name them **NextGoal** and **TutorialEnd**.

   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/create-events.png"  />

## Adding the Scripts

The three scripts below will look for the particle emitter and beam objects created earlier and manage the tutorial system.

1. In ReplicatedStorage > PlayerTutorial > create a new **ModuleScript** named **TutorialManager**.
   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/create-tutorial-manager.png"  />

   Replace the default code by copying and pasting the entire code below.

   ```lua
   local TutorialManager = {}

   local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

   local tutorialFolder = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("PlayerTutorial")
   local TutorialEndEvent = tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("TutorialEnd")
   local NextGoalEvent = tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("NextGoal")

   -- Note Goal parts must be ordered in the table, or else Goal order may be different in-game
   local goalParts = {
    workspace.TutorialGoals.GoalPart1,
    workspace.TutorialGoals.GoalPart2
   }

   local function checkTutorialEnd(player, goalParts)
    local currentIndex = player:WaitForChild("GoalProgress")
    return currentIndex.Value >= #goalParts
   end

   local function finishTutorial(player)
    local playerBeam = player.Character.HumanoidRootPart:FindFirstChildOfClass("Beam")
    playerBeam:Destroy()

    print(player.Name .. " finished the tutorial")

    -- Placeholder for further code. E.g. if you wanted to send messages to the server to do other tasks

   end

   function TutorialManager.interactGoal(player)
    NextGoalEvent:FireServer()
   end

   function TutorialManager.getTutorialGoals()
    return goalParts
   end

   function TutorialManager.nextGoal(player, goalParts)
    if checkTutorialEnd(player, goalParts) then
      finishTutorial(player)
    else
      -- Increment the player's Goal tracker
      local currentGoalIndex = player:WaitForChild("GoalProgress")
      currentGoalIndex.Value += 1
    end
   end

   -- Creates an int value to locally track player's progress through the tutorial Goals
   function TutorialManager.setupPlayerProgress(player)
    local currentGoalProgress = Instance.new("IntValue")
    currentGoalProgress.Name = "GoalProgress"
    currentGoalProgress.Value = 1
    currentGoalProgress.Parent = player
   end

   return TutorialManager
   ```

   This script runs code for managing a player's progress in the tutorial. This includes tasks like running code for interacting with goals, or what happens when the tutorial is over.

2. In **ServerScriptService**, create a new **Script** named **TutorialParticles**.
   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/create-tutorial-particles.png"  />

   Paste the code below.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
   local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")

   local tutorialFolder = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("PlayerTutorial")
   local NextGoalEvent = tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("NextGoal")

   local EMIT_RATE = 50

   local function playParticleBurst(player)
     local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
     local humanoidRootPart = character:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")
     local particleAttachment = humanoidRootPart:WaitForChild("ParticleAttachment")

     -- Go through particles on the attachment and play them according to the type of particle
     for _, particle in particleAttachment:GetChildren() do
       if particle:IsA("ParticleEmitter") then
         particle:Emit(EMIT_RATE)
       end
     end
   end

   local function setupPlayerParticles(player)
     player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
       local humanoidRootPart = character:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")
       local playerParticleAttachment = Instance.new("Attachment")
       playerParticleAttachment.Name = "ParticleAttachment"
       playerParticleAttachment.Parent = humanoidRootPart

       -- Clone particles in the folder, even if there are more than one and attach to player
       for _, emitter in ServerStorage.TutorialParticles:GetChildren() do
         emitter:Clone().Parent = playerParticleAttachment
       end
     end)
   end

   Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(setupPlayerParticles)
   NextGoalEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(playParticleBurst)
   ```

   This script plays the burst particle whenever players interact with goals. There's also a variable named `EMIT_RATE` that determines how many particles spawn during an interaction.

3. In StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts, create a new **LocalScript** named **TutorialScript**.

   <img src="../../assets/education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/adding-scripts/create-tutorial-script.png"  />

   Then, paste the script below. This script creates and manages the beam used to guide players.

   ```lua
   local Players = game:GetService("Players")
   local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

   local tutorialFolder = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("PlayerTutorial")
   local TutorialManager = require(tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("TutorialManager"))
   local TutorialEndEvent = tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("TutorialEnd")

   local player = Players.LocalPlayer
   local goalParts = TutorialManager.getTutorialGoals()
   local playerBeam = nil
   local goalIndex = nil

   local function getTargetAttachment()
     local currentTarget = goalParts[goalIndex.Value]
     local interactionPart = currentTarget:FindFirstChild("InteractionPart")
     local attachment = interactionPart and interactionPart:FindFirstChildOfClass("Attachment")

     if not attachment then
       attachment = Instance.new("Attachment")
       attachment.Name = "BeamAttachment"
       attachment.Parent = currentTarget
     end

     return attachment
   end

   local function updateBeamTarget()
     playerBeam = player.Character.HumanoidRootPart:FindFirstChildOfClass("Beam")

     local targetBeamAttachment = getTargetAttachment()

     if targetBeamAttachment then
       playerBeam.Attachment1 = targetBeamAttachment
     else
       warn("Attachment not found in a goal. Check that goals have attachments or they're included under the InteractionPart")
     end
   end

   local function setupGoals()
     for _, part in goalParts do
       local interactionPart = part:FindFirstChild("InteractionPart")
       local proximityPrompt = interactionPart and interactionPart:FindFirstChild("ProximityPrompt")

       if proximityPrompt then
         proximityPrompt.Triggered:Connect(function(player)
           proximityPrompt.Enabled = false
           TutorialManager.nextGoal(player, goalParts)
           TutorialManager.interactGoal(player)
         end)
       else
         warn("Proximity prompt not included in goal. Add one to each goal part under the InteractionPart")
       end
     end
   end

   local function createBeamForCharacter(character)
     local humanoidRootPart = character:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")
     local playerBeamAttachment = Instance.new("Attachment")
     local beamTemplate = tutorialFolder:WaitForChild("TutorialBeam")

     if not beamTemplate then
       warn("Tutorial Beam not found in ReplicatedStorage")
     end

     playerBeamAttachment.Name = "BeamAttachment"
     playerBeamAttachment.Parent = humanoidRootPart

     local targetBeamAttachment = getTargetAttachment()

     playerBeam = beamTemplate:Clone()
     playerBeam.Attachment0 = playerBeamAttachment
     playerBeam.Attachment1 = targetBeamAttachment
     playerBeam.Parent = humanoidRootPart
     playerBeam.Enabled = true
   end

   local function setupPlayer()
     setupGoals()
     TutorialManager.setupPlayerProgress(player)
     goalIndex = player:WaitForChild("GoalProgress")

     player.CharacterAdded:Connect(createBeamForCharacter)
     if player.Character then
       createBeamForCharacter(player.Character)
     end
   end

   setupPlayer()
   goalIndex.Changed:Connect(updateBeamTarget)
   ```

4. Play the project to test the scripts. Move from booth to booth, using the interact feature to see if code works.

### Troubleshooting Tips

**Issue**: Particles play when game starts.

- Go into ServerStorage > Tutorial Particles > Burst. Check Enabled to be off.

**Issue**: Warnings in the compiler such as an "infinite yield".

- Because the script is looking for specific objects in certain locations, it's possible that a part is named incorrectly. Double check that the name and location of each part in game matches the tutorial.

### Script Benefits and Limitations

If you're using this tutorial system in your experience, keep in mind the following:

**Benefits**

- Events such as TutorialEnd can be used to trigger other scripts. For instance, you can award players a special item when this event fires.
- The TutorialParticles script can play multiple particles at once. You can add more particles in ServerStorage/TutorialParticles for more complex effects.

**Limitations**

- Player progress in the tutorial is not persistent, meaning you'll have to code some way of saving that progress. For guidance, see the article: Saving Data.
