Make final changes to the blast by editing the size and how it moves.

## Change the size

1. Find **Size** and click on its row. Type a number from 1 to 10 and then press **Enter**.

   You may have a texture that looks like the example below.

2. Press **Play** to test the project. If needed, make changes to color and size to better fit your vision. When finished, finish testing by clicking the **Stop** button or pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.

## Change the move style

A particle can either be a **trail** or a **single blast** by toggling the **LockedToPart** property. The video below shows what a trailing blast vs a single blast looks like. Choose which one you like better, and then continue.

### Make trailing blasts

1. [Skip](../../education/build-it-play-it-mansion-of-wonder/making-an-explosion.md) to the next section. To have a trailing blast, don't do anything.

### Make single blasts

1. In the particle properties, scroll down to find **LockToPart**. Click the checkbox to turn it on.
