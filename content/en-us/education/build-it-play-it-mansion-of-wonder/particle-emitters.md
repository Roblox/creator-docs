description: Learn Roblox Studio camera controls and the basics of editing particle emitters in the Build It Play It Mansion of Wonders.

While testing, you may have noticed that the magic blasts are a bit bland. The white sparks you see right now are just a starting point; you'll make them much cooler by customizing a `Class.ParticleEmitter` object.

Particle emitters make special effects in Roblox Studio. If you've seen effects like smoke, fire, or even magic portals in other Roblox experiences, you've definitely seen `Class.ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`.

## Find the blast

The template has two customizable particle emitters: one for the **magic blast** that flies through the air and another for the **explosion** when it hits an enemy. Start first with the blast, and in a later tutorial, you'll work on the explosion.

1. Using the camera controls (see below for instructions), move the camera to get a good view of the magic blast, a ball with white sparkles.

   Below are **controls** on using the camera in Studio.

   <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Control</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Move</b></td>
      <td><kbd>W A S D</kbd> or arrow keys</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Rotate</b></td>
      <td>
      **Computer Mouse:** Hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to look around.  
      **Laptop Trackpad:** Hold down two fingers and click with another.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Zoom</b></td>
      <td>
      **Computer Mouse:** Use the mouse scroll wheel.  
      **Laptop Trackpad:** Slide two fingers up or down.
      </td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

2. In the top-right box in Roblox Studio, find the **Explorer** window. This has all of the pieces of the project, such as code, decorations, and the blast you'll personalize.

   <Alert severity="info">
   If you don't see it the **Explorer** window, enable it by going to the **Home** tab and clicking the **Explorer** button.

   </Alert>

3. You'll need to find the magic blast's particles in the **Explorer** window to work with it. In the **Explorer** window's **search bar**, type **BlastParticles**, then select the object found.

## Change the color

Start personalizing the magical blast by giving it a new color.

1. You can make changes to particle emitters in the **Properties** window. Find it on the bottom right of Studio, under the **Explorer** window.

   <Alert severity="info">
   If you don't see the Properties window, click the **View** tab and then click the **Properties** button.
   </Alert>

2. In the **Properties** window, find the **Color** property, then double-click the light grey box to its right. A pop-up **Colors** window displays.

3. In the **Colors** window, select a color and then click the **OK** button. For example, if you set the **Color** property to `202, 210, 20`, you will then have a particle that looks like the example below.
