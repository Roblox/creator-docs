Are you an established game developer? Or just getting started? Either way, the first impression users have of your experiences matter. If they don't like what they see or don't know what to do, they're likely to leave and never come back. One way to create a strong **first time user experience** is to teach new users how to play by designing an interactive tutorial.

While doing the tutorial, players will learn about key aspects of the experience, whether it's collecting items or knowing where to find the shop. In your tutorial, you'll guide first time players to a goal, let them know when that task has been completed, and then lead them to their next goal

The concepts and skills in this series can be applied to any experience, whether you're working on your own or want to use the supplied example map.

When finished, you'll be able to:

- Use beams to design a trail that guides players to each goal.
- Create a particle effect that plays when a player completes their task.
- Add scripts to track the player's current goals and progress.
